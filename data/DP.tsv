Author information: (1)University of Minnesota School of Medicine. (2)University of Washington School of Medicine.	Accumulating evidence indicates that the fetal environment plays an important  role in brain development and sets the brain on a trajectory across the life  span. An abnormal fetal environment results when factors that should be present  during a critical period of development are absent or when factors that should  not be in the developing brain are present. While these factors may acutely  disrupt brain function, the real cost to society resides in the long-term  effects, which include important mental health issues. We review the effects of  three factors, fetal alcohol exposure, teratogen exposure, and nutrient  deficiencies, on the developing brain and the consequent risk for developmental  psychopathology. Each is reviewed with respect to the evidence found in  epidemiological and clinical studies in humans as well as preclinical molecular  and cellular studies that explicate mechanisms of action.

Author information: (1)Arizona State University. (2)University of Minnesota,Twin Cities.	Culture plays a pivotal role in adaptive and maladaptive development. However,  culture remains disconnected from theory, research, training, assessment, and  interventions in developmental psychopathology, limiting our understanding of  the genesis and epigenesis of mental health. Cultural development and  psychopathology research can help overcome this limitation by focusing on the  elucidation of cultural risk, protective, and promotive factors, at the  individual and social levels, that initiate, derail, or maintain trajectories of  normal and abnormal behavior. The goal of this Special Issue is to showcase  research on the association between culture, development, and psychopathology  that investigates equifinality and multifinality in cultural development, the  interplay between culture and biology, cultural assessment and interventions,  and cultural differences and similarities.

Coping in context: The effects of long-term relations between interparental  conflict and coping on the development of child psychopathology following  parental divorce.	O'Hara KL(1), Sandler IN(1), Wolchik SA(1), Tein JY(1).	Author information: (1)REACH Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287, USA.	Exposure to high levels of postdivorce interparental conflict is a  well-documented risk factor for the development of psychopathology, and there is  strong evidence of a subpopulation of families for which conflict persists for  many years after divorce. However, existing studies have not elucidated  differential trajectories of conflict within families over time, nor have they  assessed the risk posed by conflict trajectories for development of  psychopathology or evaluated potential protective effects of children's coping  to mitigate such risk. We used growth mixture modeling to identify longitudinal  trajectories of child-reported conflict over a period of six to eight years  following divorce in a sample of 240 children. We related the trajectories to  children's mental health problems, substance use, and risky sexual behaviors and  assessed how children's coping prospectively predicted psychopathology in the  different conflict trajectories. We identified three distinct trajectories of  conflict; youth in two high-conflict trajectories showed deleterious effects on  measures of psychopathology at baseline and the six-year follow-up. We found  both main effects of coping and coping by conflict trajectory interaction  effects in predicting problem outcomes at the six-year follow-up. The study  supports the notion that improving youth's general capacity to cope adaptively  is a potentially modifiable protective factor for all children facing parental  divorce and that children in families with high levels of postdivorce conflict  are a particularly appropriate group to target for coping-focused preventive  interventions.

Glover V(1), O'Donnell KJ(2), O'Connor TG(3), Fisher J(4).	Author information: (1)Imperial College London. (2)McGill University. (3)University of Rochester Medical Center. (4)Monash University.	There is clear evidence that the mother's stress, anxiety, or depression during  pregnancy can alter the development of her fetus and her child, with an  increased risk for later psychopathology. We are starting to understand some of  the underlying mechanisms including the role of the placenta, gene-environment  interactions, epigenetics, and specific systems including the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and cytokines. In this review we also  consider how these effects may be different, and potentially exacerbated, in  different parts of the world. There can be many reasons for elevated prenatal  stress, as in communities at war. There may be raised pregnancy-specific anxiety  with high levels of maternal and infant death. There can be raised interpersonal  violence (in Afghanistan 90.2% of women thought that "wife beating" was  justified compared with 2.0% in Argentina). There may be interactions with  nutritional deficiencies or with extremes of temperature. Prenatal stress alters  the microbiome, and this can differ in different countries. Genetic differences  in different ethnic groups may make some more vulnerable or more resilient to  the effects of prenatal stress on child neurodevelopment. Most research on these  questions has been in predominantly Caucasian samples from high-income  countries. It is now time to understand more about prenatal stress and  psychopathology, and the role of both social and biological differences, in the  rest of the world.

Author information: (1)James J. Peters Veterans Affairs Medical Center.	The question of whether and how the effects of cultural trauma can be  transmitted intergenerationally from parents to offspring, or even to later  generations, has evoked interest and controversy in academic and popular forums.  Recent methodological advances have spurred investigations of potential  epigenetic mechanisms for this inheritance, representing an exciting area of  emergent research. Epigenetics has been described as the means through which  environmental influences "get under the skin," directing transcriptional  activity and influencing the expression or suppression of genes. Over the past  decade, this complex environment-biology interface has shown increasing promise  as a potential pathway for the intergenerational transmission of the effects of  trauma. This article reviews challenges facing research on cultural trauma,  biological findings in trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder, and putative  epigenetic mechanisms for transmission of trauma effects, including through  social, intrauterine, and gametic pathways. Implications for transmission of  cultural trauma effects are discussed, focused on the relevance of cultural  narratives and the possibilities of resilience and adaptivity.

Deprivation and threat, emotion dysregulation, and psychopathology: Concurrent  and longitudinal associations.	Milojevich HM(1), Norwalk KE(2), Sheridan MA(3).

(3)Department of Psychology and Neuroscience,University of North Carolina at  Chapel Hill,Chapel Hill, NC,USA.	Maltreatment increases risk for psychopathology in childhood and adulthood, thus  identifying mechanisms that influence these associations is necessary for future  prevention and intervention. Emotion dysregulation resulting from maltreatment  is one potentially powerful mechanism explaining risk for psychopathology. This  study tests a conceptual model that distinguishes deprivation and threat as  distinct forms of exposure with different pathways to psychopathology. Here we  operationalize threat as exposure to physical and/or sexual abuse and  deprivation as exposure to neglect. We test the hypothesis that threat and  deprivation differentially predict use of avoidant strategies and total  regulation. Data were drawn from the Longitudinal Studies on Child Abuse and  Neglect (LONGSCAN study; N = 866), which followed high-risk children from age 4  to 18. At age 6, children and their parents reported on adversity exposure. Case  records documented exposure to abuse and neglect. At 18, adolescents reported on  regulation strategies and psychopathology. Regression analyses indicated that  greater exposure to threat, but not deprivation, predicted greater use of  avoidant strategies in adolescence. Moreover, avoidance partially mediated the  longitudinal association between exposure to threat in early childhood and  symptoms of internalizing psychopathology in adolescence. Results suggest that  abuse and neglect differentially predict regulation strategy use and that  regulation strategy use predicts psychopathology.

(2)Department of Developmental,Personality, and Social Psychology,Ghent  University,Ghent,Belgium.

Grounded in self-determination theory's (SDT; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017) organismic  perspective, we present a process view of integrative emotion regulation. SDT  describes three general types of emotion regulation: integrative emotion  regulation, which focuses on emotions as carrying information that is brought to  awareness; controlled emotion regulation, which is focused on diminishing  emotions through avoidance, suppression, or enforced expression or reappraisal;  and amotivated emotion regulation, in which emotions are uncontrolled or  dysregulated. We review survey and experimental research contrasting these  emotion regulation styles, providing evidence for the benefits of integrative  emotion regulation for volitional functioning, personal well-being, and  high-quality relationships, and for the costs of controlled emotion regulation  and dysregulation. The development of emotion regulation styles is discussed,  especially the role of autonomy-supportive parenting in fostering more  integrative emotion regulation, and the role of controlling parenting in  contributing to controlled or dysregulated emotion processing. Overall,  integrative emotion regulation represents a beneficial style of processing  emotions, which develops most effectively in a nonjudgmental and  autonomy-supportive environment, an issue relevant to both development and  psychotherapy.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology,Simon Fraser University,Vancouver, BC,Canada.	Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe and complex disorder  characterized by instability across many life domains, including interpersonal  relations, behavior, and emotions. A core feature and contributor to BPD,  emotion dysegulation (ED), consists of deficits in the ability to regulate  emotions in a manner that allows the individual to pursue important goals or  behave effectively in various contexts. Biosocial developmental models of BPD  have emphasized a transaction of environmental conditions (e.g., invalidating  environments and adverse childhood experiences) with key genetically linked  vulnerabilities (e.g., impulsivity and emotional vulnerability) in the  development of ED and BPD. Emerging evidence has begun to highlight the complex,  heterotypic pathways to the development of BPD, with key heritable vulnerability  factors possibly interacting with aspects of the rearing environment to produce  worsening ED and an adolescent trajectory consisting of self-damaging behaviors  and eventual BPD. Adults with BPD have shown evidence of a variety of cognitive,  physiological, and behavioral characteristics of ED. As the precursors to the  development of ED and BPD have become clearer, prevention and treatment efforts  hold great promise for reducing the long-term suffering, functional impairment,  and considerable societal costs associated with BPD.

De Weerth C(1).	Author information: (1)Radboud University.	Maternal psychological stress, depression, and anxiety during pregnancy  (prenatal stress; PNS) are thought to impact fetal development with long-term  effects on offspring outcome. These effects would include physical and mental  health, including psychopathology. Maternal sleep, diet, and exercise during  pregnancy are lifestyle behaviors that are understudied and often solely  included in PNS studies as confounders. However, there are indications that  these lifestyle behaviors may actually constitute essential mediators between  PNS and fetal programming processes. The goal of this theoretical review was to  investigate this idea by looking at the evidence for associations between PNS  and sleep, diet, and exercise, and by piecing together the information on  potential underlying mechanisms and causal pathways through which these factors  may affect the offspring. The analysis of the literature led to the conclusion  that sleep, diet, and exercise during pregnancy, may have fundamental roles as  mediators between PNS and maternal pregnancy physiology. By integrating these  lifestyle behaviors into models of prenatal programming of development, a  qualitatively higher and more comprehensive understanding of the prenatal  origins of psychopathology can be obtained. The review finalizes by discussing  some of the present challenges facing the field of PNS and offspring  programming, and offering solutions for future research.

The prenatal period is increasingly considered as a crucial target for the  primary prevention of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.  Understanding their pathophysiological mechanisms remains a great challenge. Our  review reveals new insights from prenatal brain development research, involving  (epi)genetic research, neuroscience, recent imaging techniques, physical  modeling, and computational simulation studies. Studies examining the effect of  prenatal exposure to maternal distress on offspring brain development, using  brain imaging techniques, reveal effects at birth and up into adulthood.  Structural and functional changes are observed in several brain regions  including the prefrontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, as well as the  cerebellum, hippocampus, and amygdala. Furthermore, alterations are seen in  functional connectivity of amygdalar-thalamus networks and in intrinsic brain  networks, including default mode and attentional networks. The observed changes  underlie offspring behavioral, cognitive, emotional development, and  susceptibility to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. It is concluded  that used brain measures have not yet been validated with regard to sensitivity,  specificity, accuracy, or robustness in predicting neurodevelopmental and  psychiatric disorders. Therefore, more prospective long-term longitudinal  follow-up studies starting early in pregnancy should be carried out, in order to  examine brain developmental measures as mediators in mediating the link between  prenatal stress and offspring behavioral, cognitive, and emotional problems and  susceptibility for disorders.

(2)Virginia Commonwealth University.	We examined genetic and environmental contributions to the development of  symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in preschool  children. ADHD symptoms in siblings at 1.5, 3, and 5 years of age were  investigated in a population-based sample from the prospective Norwegian Mother  and Child Cohort Study. The longitudinal contributions of additive genetic,  shared, twin-specific, and unique environmental influences were estimated using  biometric structural equation models. Heritability of ADHD symptoms ranged from  54% to 70%. There was evidence of partially new genetic influences at successive  ages, with genetic correlations ranging from .58 to .89. Contributions from  shared environmental factors and twin-specific factors were minor. The  importance of unique environmental effects appeared to increase across ages, and  was mostly specific to a given age. There was no evidence suggesting that this  pattern differs across males and females. Symptoms of ADHD are highly  heritability in young children from as early as 1.5 years of age. Longitudinal  stability of ADHD symptoms is mainly attributable to genetic influences, but  there is also some evidence for age-specific genetic influences. These findings  contribute to our understanding of development of ADHD early in life, and can  guide future molecular genetics studies.

Zohar AH(1), Zwir I(2), Wang J(2), Cloninger CR(2), Anokhin AP(2).	Author information: (1)Ruppin Academic Center,Israel. (2)Washington University School of Medicine,St. Louis.	We studied the pattern of personality development in a longitudinal  population-based sample of 752 American adolescents. Personality was assessed  reliably with the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory at 12, 14, and 16  years of age. The rank-order stability of Junior Temperament and Character  Inventory traits from age 12 to 16 was moderate (r = .35). Hierarchical linear  modeling of between-group variance due to gender and within-group variance due  to age indicated that harm avoidance and persistence decreased whereas  self-directedness and cooperativeness increased from age 12 to 16. Novelty  seeking, reward dependence, and self-transcendence increased from age 12 to 14  and then decreased. This biphasic pattern suggests that prior to age 14 teens  became more emancipated from adult authorities while identifying more with the  emergent norms of their peers, and after age 14 their created identity was  internalized. Girls were more self-directed and cooperative than boys and  maintained this advantage from age 12 to 16. Dependability of temperament at age  16 was mainly predicted by the same traits at earlier ages. In contrast,  maturity of character at age 16 was predicted by both temperament and character  at earlier ages. We conclude that character develops rapidly in adolescence to  self-regulate temperament in accord with personally valued goals shaped by  peers.

(3)Capital Normal University,Beijing,China.	Mapuche represents the largest indigenous group in Chile amounting to nearly 10%  of the total population. In a longitudinal cohort of 12,398 children, we  analyzed the role of ethnicity in physical and psychosocial development of  Mapuche and nonindigenous Chilean toddlers (age 2.5 years), taking into account  sociodemographic and caregiver characteristics. As indicated by our univariate  analysis, the Mapuche developmental niche was characterized by lower income,  lower maternal education, poorer quality of the home environment, longer  breastfeeding, and higher parental stress. Physical development showed higher  body mass index. Mapuche children showed less externalizing problems. We then  analyzed the incremental contribution of ethnicity in a series of hierarchical  regressions with the second wave of developmental measurements (age 4.5 years)  as outcome variables, showing a significant but modest incremental contribution  of ethnicity to the prediction of children's development between 2.5 and 4.5  years of age. Controlling for environmental variables, Mapuche showed less  externalizing and internalizing, behavior problems. Socioeconomic status,  quality of the home environment, and parenting stress were stronger predictors  of socioemotional development than ethnicity per se.

Linking Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs to developmental  psychopathology: The role of self-regulation and emotion knowledge in the  development of internalizing and externalizing growth trajectories from ages 3  to 10.	Ip KI(1), Jester JM(2), Sameroff A(1), Olson SL(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology. (2)Department of Psychiatry,University of Michigan,Ann Arbor,MI,USA.	Identifying Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs in early childhood is  essential for understanding etiological pathways of psychopathology. Our central  goal was to identify early emotion knowledge and self-regulation difficulties  across different RDoC domains and examine how they relate to typical versus  atypical symptom trajectories between ages 3 and 10. Particularly, we assessed  potential contributions of children's gender, executive control, delay of  gratification, and regulation of frustration, emotion recognition, and emotion  understanding at age 3 to co-occurring patterns of internalizing and  externalizing across development. A total of 238 3-year-old boys and girls were  assessed using behavioral tasks and parent reports and reassessed at ages 5 and  10 years. Results indicated that very few children developed "pure"  internalizing or externalizing symptoms relative to various levels of  co-occurring symptoms across development. Four classes of co-occurring  internalizing and externalizing problems were identified: low, low-moderate,  rising, and severe-decreasing trajectories. Three-year-old children with poor  executive control but high emotion understanding were far more likely to show  severe-decreasing than low/low-moderate class co-occurring internalizing and  externalizing symptom patterns. Child gender and poor executive control  differentiated children in rising versus low trajectories. Implications for  early intervention targeting self-regulation of executive control are discussed.

There is a growing body of evidence highlighting the presence of a single  general dimension of psychopathology that can account for multiple associations  across mental and substance use disorders. However, relatively little evidence  has emerged regarding the validity of this model with respect to a range of  factors that have been previously implicated across multiple disorders. The  current study utilized a cross-sectional population survey of adolescents (n =  2,003) to examine the extent to which broad psychopathology factors account for  specific associations between psychopathology and key validators: poor sleep,  self-harm, suicidality, risky sexual behavior, and low self-esteem. Confirmatory  factor models, latent class models, and factor mixture models were estimated to  identify the best structure of psychopathology. Structural equation models were  then estimated to examine the broad and specific associations between each  psychopathology indicator and the validators. A confirmatory factor model with  three lower-order factors, representing internalizing, externalizing, and  psychotic-like experiences, and a single higher-order factor evidenced the best  fit. The associations between manifest indicators of psychopathology and  validators were largely nonspecific. However, significant and large direct  effects were found between several pairwise associations. These findings have  implications for the identification of potential targets for intervention and/or  tailoring of prevention programs.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000437 PMID: 32468983

Allen JP(1), Narr RK(1), Loeb EL(1), Davis AA(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.	Adolescent association with deviant and delinquent friends was examined for its  roots in coercive parent-teen interactions and its links to functional  difficulties extending beyond delinquent behavior and into adulthood. A  community sample of 184 adolescents was followed from age 13 to age 27, with  collateral data obtained from close friends, classmates, and parents. Even after  accounting for adolescent levels of delinquent and deviant behavior, association  with deviant friends was predicted by coercive parent-teen interactions and then  linked to declining functioning with peers during adolescence and greater  internalizing and externalizing symptoms and poorer overall adjustment in  adulthood. Results are interpreted as suggesting that association with deviant  friends may disrupt a core developmental task-establishing positive  relationships with peers-with implications that extend well beyond  deviancy-training effects.

Excitability and irritability in preschoolers predicts later psychopathology:  The importance of positive and negative emotion dysregulation.	Vogel AC(1), Jackson JJ(2), Barch DM(1), Tillman R(1), Luby JL(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry,Washington University in St. Louis School of  Medicine,St. Louis,MO,USA. (2)Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences,Washington University in St.  Louis,St. Louis, MO,USA.	Emotion dysregulation is a risk factor for the development of a variety of  psychopathologic outcomes. In children, irritability, or dysregulated negative  affect, has been the primary focus, as it predicts later negative outcomes even  in very young children. However, dysregulation of positive emotion is  increasingly recognized as a contributor to psychopathology. Here we used an  exploratory factor analysis and defined four factors of emotion dysregulation:  irritability, excitability, sadness, and anhedonia, in the preschool-age  psychiatric assessment collected in a sample of 302 children ages 3-5 years  enriched for early onset depression. The irritability and excitability factor  scores defined in preschoolers predicted later diagnosis of mood and  externalizing disorders when controlling for other factor scores, social  adversity, maternal history of mood disorders, and externalizing diagnoses at  baseline. The preschool excitability factor score predicted emotion lability in  late childhood and early adolescence when controlling for other factor scores,  social adversity, and maternal history. Both excitability and irritability  factor scores in preschoolers predicted global functioning into the teen years  and early adolescence, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of  positive, as well as negative, affect dysregulation as early as the preschool  years in predicting later psychopathology, which deserves both further study and  clinical consideration.

Considered alongside communities' abilities to respond to  external forces, like stratification, in ways that promote youth adaptive  functioning and mitigate maladaptive functioning, it is likely that residence in  segregated neighborhoods during adolescence has both costs and benefits. We  examined the influences that early adolescents' neighborhood structural  characteristics, including Latino concentration and concentrated poverty, had on  a range of developmentally salient downstream outcomes (i.e., internalizing,  externalizing, prosocial behaviors, and ethnic-racial identity resolution) via  implications for intermediate aspects of adolescents' community participation  and engagement (i.e., ethnic-racial identity exploration, ethnic-racial  discrimination from peers, and school attachment). These mediational mechanisms  were tested prospectively across three waves (Mage w1-w3 = 12.79, 15.83, 17.37  years, respectively) in a sample of 733 Mexican-origin adolescents (48.8%  female). We found higher neighborhood Latino concentration during early  adolescence predicted greater school attachment and ethnic-racial identity  exploration and lower discrimination from peers in middle adolescence. These  benefits, in turn, were associated with lower externalizing and internalizing  and higher ethnic-racial identity resolution and prosocial behaviors in late  adolescence. Findings are discussed relative to major guidelines for integrating  culture into development and psychopathology.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418001177 PMID: 30289093 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Shahar G(1), Henrich CC(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology,Ben-Gurion University of the Negev,Be'er  Sheva,Israel. (2)Department of Psychology,Georgia State University,Atlanta,GA,USA.	The aim of this study is to examine the role of repeated exposure to rocket  attacks in the links between personality vulnerability (dependency and  self-criticism) and internalizing/externalizing psychopathology. A main-effect  vulnerability model (personality leads to psychopathology) was compared with a  main-effect scarring model (psychopathology leads to personality vulnerability).  Also, a stress-diathesis pattern (personality vulnerability is activated under  stress) was compared to a dual-vulnerability pattern (either personality  vulnerability or stress, but not both, lead to psychopathology). Israeli  adolescents (N = 362) repeatedly exposed to rocket attacks were assessed  annually over 3 years. In 2008 and 2010, personality and psychopathology were  assessed. Cumulative exposure was measured as the sums of exposure across the  three assessment waves. Theoretical models were tested via Autoregressive  Cross-Lagged Structural Equation Modeling analyses. Baseline dependency and  self-criticism were associated with an increase in anxiety, whereas baseline  depression was associated with an increase in dependency. Under low, not high,  levels of rocket exposure, self-criticism and depression were longitudinally  associated. Violence commission was associated with an increase in dependency  under high, not low, cumulative exposure. Results are consistent with both  scarring and vulnerability models, and with both stress-diathesis and  dual-vulnerability patterns of adolescent risk and resilience.

Prior research has shown that sipping of alcohol begins to emerge during  childhood and is potentially etiologically significant for later substance use  problems. Using a large, community sample of 9- and 10-year-olds (N = 11,872;  53% female), we examined individual differences in precocious alcohol use in the  form of alcohol sipping. We focused explicitly on features that are robust and  well-demonstrated correlates of, and antecedents to, alcohol excess and related  problems later in the lifespan, including youth- and parent-reported  externalizing traits (i.e., impulsivity, behavioral inhibition and activation)  and psychopathology. Seventeen percent of the sample reported sipping alcohol  outside of a religiously sanctioned activity by age 9 or 10. Several aspects of  psychopathology and personality emerged as small but reliable correlates of  sipping. Nonreligious sipping was related to youth-reported impulsigenic traits,  aspects of behavioral activation, prodromal psychotic-like symptoms, and mood  disorder diagnoses, as well as parent-reported externalizing disorder diagnoses.  Religious sipping was unexpectedly associated with certain aspects of  impulsivity. Together, our findings point to the potential importance of  impulsivity and other transdiagnostic indicators of psychopathology (e.g.,  emotion dysregulation, novelty seeking) in the earliest forms of drinking  behavior.

It is unclear how individual differences in parenting and brain development  interact to influence adolescent mental health outcomes. This study examined  interactions between structural brain development and observed maternal  parenting behavior in the prediction of adolescent depressive symptoms and  psychological well-being. Whether findings supported diathesis-stress or  differential susceptibility frameworks was tested. Participants completed  observed interactions with their mothers during early adolescence (age 13), and  the frequency of positive and aggressive maternal behavior were coded.  Adolescents also completed structural magnetic resonance imaging scans at three  time points: mean ages 13, 17, and 19. Regression models analyzed interactions  between maternal behavior and longitudinal brain development in the prediction  of late adolescent (age 19) outcomes. Indices designed to distinguish between  diathesis-stress and differential susceptibility effects were employed. Results  supported differential susceptibility: less thinning of frontal regions was  associated with higher well-being in the context of low levels of aggressive  maternal behavior, and lower well-being in the context of high levels of  aggressive maternal behavior. Findings suggest that reduced frontal cortical  thinning during adolescence may underlie increased sensitivity to maternal  aggressive behavior for better and worse and highlight the importance of  investigating biological vulnerability versus susceptibility.

Tottenham N(1).	Author information: (1)Columbia University, Department of Psychology.	Early adversities that are caregiving-related (crEAs) are associated with a  significantly increased risk for mental health problems. Recent neuroscientific  advances have revealed alterations in medial prefrontal cortex  (mPFC)-subcortical circuitry following crEAs. While this work has identified  alterations in affective operations (e.g., perceiving, reacting, controlling,  learning) associated with mPFC-subcortical circuitry, this circuitry has a much  broader function extending beyond operations. It plays a primary role in  affective meaning making, involving conceptual-level, schematized knowledge to  generate predictions about the current environment. This function of  mPFC-subcortical circuitry motivates asking whether mPFC-subcortical phenotypes  following crEAs support semanticized knowledge content (or the concept-level  knowledge) and generate predictive models. I present a hypothesis motivated by  research findings across four different lines of work that converge on  mPFC-subcortical neuroanatomy, including (a) the neurobiology supporting emotion  regulation processes in adulthood, (b) the neurobiology that is activated by  caregiving cues during development, (c) the neurobiology that is altered by  crEAs, and (d) the neurobiology of semantic-based meaning making. I hypothesize  that the affective behaviors following crEAs result in part from affective  semantic memory processes supported by mPFC-subcortical circuitry that over the  course of development, construct affective schemas that generate meaning making  and guide predictions. I use this opportunity to review some of the literature  on mPFC-subcortical circuit development following crEAs to illustrate the  motivation behind this hypothesis. Long recognized by clinical science and  cognitive neuroscience, studying schema-based processes may be particularly  helpful for understanding how affective meaning making arises from developmental  trajectories of mPFC-subcortical circuitry.

Swanson MR(1).	Author information: (1)School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, TX,  USA.	Parents play an essential role in supporting child development by providing a  safe home, proper nutrition, and rich educational opportunities. In this article  we focus on the role of caregiver speech in supporting development of young  children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We review studies from typically  developing children and children with autism showing that rich and responsive  caregiver speech supports language development. Autism intervention studies that  target caregiver speech are reviewed as are recent scientific advances from  studies of typical development. The strengths and weakness of different  techniques for collecting language data from caregivers and children are  reviewed, and natural language samples are recommended as best practice for  language research in autism. We conclude that caregivers play a powerful role in  shaping their children's development and encourage researchers to adapt  parent-mediated intervention studies to acknowledge individual differences in  parents by using a personalized medicine approach.

Author information: (1)Yeshiva University, New York, NY, USA. (2)University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK and Utrecht University, Utrecht, The  Netherlands. (3)Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.	This is the first review to rigorously examine the mediating role of cognitive  factors in the relationship between childhood trauma and subsequent adult  psychopathology, and highlight areas for future research. A database search  (Child Development & Adolescent Studies, ERIC, Global Health, PsycARTICLES, and  PsycINFO) was conducted to identify empirical studies on cognitive factors,  explaining the relationship between different types of adverse childhood  experiences and adult psychopathology across clinical and nonclinical  populations. A narrative synthesis and appraisal of the methodological quality  of the studies was conducted. Ninety-eight mediation studies were identified,  comprising 4,137 clinical and 28,228 nonclinical participants. Despite great  variation in methodological quality of the studies, our narrative synthesis  suggests that cognitive factors mediate the relationship between early trauma  and later psychopathology. This finding is consistent across different measures  of traumatic experiences, psychopathology, and cognitive mediators. Cognitive  mediators represent potentially valuable intervention targets for (non)clinical  patients who have experienced childhood adversity. Future studies are needed to  (a) establish longitudinal causal connections, and (b) assess the effect of  interventions that specifically target cognitive change in patients with  different levels and types of pathology.

The influence of prenatal experience on behavioral and social development: The  benefits and limitations of an animal model.	Lickliter R(1).	Author information: (1)Florida International University.	Prenatal experience is both a formative and a regulatory force in the process of  development. As a result, birth is not an adequate starting point for  explanations of behavioral development. However, surprisingly little is  currently known regarding the role of prenatal experience in the emergence and  facilitation of perceptual, cognitive, or social development. Our lack of  knowledge in this area is due in part to the very restricted experimental  manipulations possible with human fetuses. A comparative approach utilizing  animal models provides an essential step in addressing this gap in our knowledge  and providing testable predictions for studies with human fetuses, infants, and  children. Further, animal-based comparative research serves to minimize the  amount of exploratory research undertaken with human subjects and hone in on  issues and research directions worthy of further research investment. In this  article, I review selected animal-based research exploring how developmental  influences during the prenatal period can guide and constrain subsequent  behavioral and social development. I then discuss the importance of linking the  prenatal environment to postnatal outcomes in terms of how psychologists  conceptualize "innate" biases, preferences, and skills in the study of human  development.

Hartman S(1), Li Z(1), Nettle D(2), Belsky J(1).	Author information: (1)University of California,Davis. (2)Newcastle University.	A wealth of evidence documents associations between various aspects of the  rearing environment and later development. Two evolutionary-inspired models  advance explanations for why and how such early experiences shape later  functioning: (a) the external-prediction model, which highlights the role of the  early environment (e.g., parenting) in regulating children's development, and  (b) the internal-prediction model, which emphasizes internal state (i.e.,  health) as the critical regulator. Thus, by using data from the NICHD Study of  Early Child Care and Youth Development, the current project draws from both  models by investigating whether the effect of the early environment on later  adolescent functioning is subject to an indirect effect by internal-health  variables. Results showed a significant indirect effect of internal health on  the relation between the early environment and adolescent behavior.  Specifically, early environmental adversity during the first 5 years of life  predicted lower quality health during childhood, which then led to problematic  adolescent functioning and earlier age of menarche for girls. In addition, for  girls, early adversity predicted lower quality health that forecasted earlier  age of menarche leading to increased adolescent risk taking. The discussion  highlights the importance of integrating both internal and external models to  further understand the developmental processes that effect adolescent behavior.

An interaction between early threat exposure and the oxytocin receptor in  females: Disorder-specific versus general risk for psychopathology and  social-emotional mediators.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,  Pittsburgh, PA, USA. (2)Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. (3)Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD,  USA.	Early threat exposure is a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology, and  evidence suggests that genetic variation in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR)  moderates this association. However, it is unclear if this gene-by-environment  (G×E) interaction is tied to unique risk for disorder-specific outcomes or  instead increases shared risk for general psychopathology. Moreover, little is  known about how this G×E interaction increases risk. The current study utilized  a prospective, longitudinal sample of females (n = 2,020) to examine: (a)  whether the interaction between early threat exposure and OXTR variation  (rs53576, rs2254298) confers risk for disorder-specific outcomes (depression,  anxiety, borderline and antisocial personality disorders) and/or general  psychopathology in early adulthood; and (b) whether social-emotional deficits  (emotion dysregulation, callousness, attachment quality) during adolescence  constitute mediating mechanisms. Consistent with hypotheses, the interactive  effects of early threat exposure and OXTR variation (rs53576) predicted general  psychopathology, with threat-exposed women carrying at least one copy of the  rs53576 A-allele at greatest risk. This interaction was mediated via emotional  dysregulation in adolescence, with threat-exposed A-allele carriers  demonstrating greater emotion dysregulation, and greater emotion dysregulation  predicting general psychopathology in early adulthood. Findings suggest that  this G×E places women at risk for a broad range of psychopathology via effects  on emotion dysregulation.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000462 PMID: 32693857

Maltreatment by parents can be conceptualized as pathogenic escalations of a  disturbed parent-child relationship that have devastating consequences for  children's development and mental health. Although parental psychopathology has  been shown to be a risk factor both for maltreatment and insecure attachment  representations, these factors` joint contribution to child psychopathology has  not been investigated. In a sample of Burundian refugee families living in  refugee camps in Western Tanzania, the associations between attachment  representations, maltreatment, and psychopathology were examined by conducting  structured interviews with 226 children aged 7 to 15 and both their parents.  Structural equation modeling revealed that children's insecure attachment  representations and maltreatment by mothers fully mediated the relation between  maternal and child psychopathology [model fit: comparative fit index (CFI) =  0.96; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05]. A direct  association between paternal and child psychopathology was observed (model fit:  CFI = 0.96; RMSEA = 0.05). The findings suggest a vicious cycle, wherein an  insecure attachment to a mother suffering from psychopathology may be linked to  children's risk to be maltreated, which may reinforce insecure representations  and perpetuate the pathogenic relational experience. Interventions targeting the  attachment relationship and parental mental health may prevent negative child  outcomes.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000516 PMID: 32594965

Identifying the contribution of prenatal risk factors to offspring development  and psychopathology: What designs to use and a critique of literature on  maternal smoking and stress in pregnancy.	Rice F(1), Langley K(2), Woodford C(1), Davey Smith G(3), Thapar A(1).	Author information: (1)MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics. (2)Cardiff University. (3)Bristol University.	Identifying prenatal environmental factors that have genuinely causal effects on  psychopathology is an important research priority, but it is crucial to select  an appropriate research design. In this review we explain why and what sorts of  designs are preferable and focus on genetically informed/sensitive designs. In  the field of developmental psychopathology, causal inferences about prenatal  risks have not always been based on evidence generated from appropriate designs.  We focus on reported links between maternal smoking during pregnancy and  offspring attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or conduct problems.  Undertaking a systematic review of findings from genetically informed designs  and "triangulating" evidence from studies with different patterns of bias, we  conclude that at present findings suggest it is unlikely that there is a  substantial causal effect of maternal smoking in pregnancy on either  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or conduct problems. In contrast, for  offspring birth weight (which serves as a positive control) findings strongly  support a negative causal effect of maternal smoking in pregnancy. For maternal  pregnancy stress, too few studies use genetically sensitive designs to draw firm  conclusions, but continuity with postnatal stress seems important. We highlight  the importance of moving beyond observational designs, for systematic evaluation  of the breadth of available evidence and choosing innovative designs. We  conclude that a broader set of prenatal risk factors should be examined,  including those relevant in low- and middle-income contexts. Future directions  include a greater use of molecular genetically informed designs such as  Mendelian randomization to test causal hypotheses about prenatal exposure and  offspring outcome.

Prenatal stress and models explaining risk for psychopathology revisited:  Generic vulnerability and divergent pathways.	Huizink AC(1), de Rooij SR(1).	Author information: (1)Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.	The present review revisits three hypothesized models that potentially could  explain how prenatal maternal stress influences fetal development, birth  outcomes, and subsequent developmental psychopathology. These models were mostly  based on animal models, and new evidence for these models from human studies is  evaluated. Furthermore, divergent trajectories from prenatal exposure to  adversities to offspring affected outcomes are reviewed, including the  comparison of studies on prenatal maternal stress with research on maternal  substance use and maternal malnutrition during pregnancy. Finally, new  directions in research on the mechanism underlying prenatal stress effects on  human offspring is summarized. While it is concluded that there is abundant  evidence for the negative associations between prenatal maternal stress and  offspring behavioral, brain, and psychopathological outcomes in humans, there is  no consistent evidence for specific mechanisms or specific outcomes in relation  to stress exposure in utero. Rather, principles of multifinality and  equifinality best describe the consequences for the offspring, suggesting a  generic vulnerability and different pathways from prenatal adversities to  developmental psychopathology, which complicates the search for underlying  mechanisms. New and promising directions for research are provided to get a  better understanding of how prenatal stress gets under the skin to affect fetal  development.

Understanding differences in social-emotional behavior can help identify  atypical development. This study examined the differences in social-emotional  development in children at increased risk of an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)  diagnosis (infant siblings of children diagnosed with the disorder). Parents  completed the Brief Infant-Toddler Social-Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) to  determine its ability to flag children with later-diagnosed ASD in a high-risk  (HR) sibling population. Parents of HR (n = 311) and low-risk (LR; no family  history of ASD; n = 127) children completed the BITSEA when their children were  18 months old and all children underwent a diagnostic assessment for ASD at age  3 years. All six subscales of the BITSEA (Problems, Competence, ASD Problems,  ASD Competence, Total ASD Score, and Red Flags) distinguished between those in  the HR group who were diagnosed with ASD (n = 84) compared to non-ASD-diagnosed  children (both HR-N and LR). One subscale (BITSEA Competence) differentiated  between the HR children not diagnosed with ASD and the LR group. The results  suggest that tracking early social-emotional development may have implications  for all HR children, as they are at increased risk of ASD but also other  developmental or mental health conditions.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. (2)Department of Psychology, University of Bath, Bath, UK. (3)Centre for Appearance Research, University of the West of England, Bristol,  UK.	Background: Negative body image predicts many adverse outcomes. The current  study prospectively examined patterns of body esteem development in early  adolescence and identified predictors of developmental subtypes. Methods: 328  girls and 429 boys reported annually across a 4-year period (Mage at baseline =  11.14, SD = 0.35) on body esteem, appearance ideal internalization, perceived  sociocultural pressures, appearance comparisons, appearance-related teasing,  self-esteem, positive and negative affect, and dietary restraint. We performed  latent class growth analyses to identify the most common trajectories of body  esteem development and examine risk and protective factors for body image  development. Results: Three developmental subgroups were identified: (a) high  body esteem (39.1%); (b) moderate body esteem (46.1%); and (c) low body esteem  (14.8%). Body esteem was stable within the low trajectory and there were minor  fluctuations in the high and moderate trajectories. Greater appearance-related  teasing, lower self-esteem, less positive affect, and higher dietary restraint  predicted the low trajectory, whereas higher self-esteem and lower dietary  restraint best predicted the high trajectory. Conclusions: Low body esteem  appears to be largely stable from age 11 years. Prevention programming may be  enhanced by incorporating components to address transdiagnostic resilience  factors such as self-esteem and positive affect.

Social-cognitive mechanisms in the cycle of violence: Cognitive and affective  theory of mind, and externalizing psychopathology in children and adolescents.	Heleniak C(1), McLaughlin KA(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. (2)Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.	Children who are victims of interpersonal violence have a markedly elevated risk  of engaging in aggressive behavior and perpetrating violence in adolescence and  adulthood. Although alterations in social information processing have long been  understood as a core mechanism underlying the link between violence exposure and  externalizing behavior, scant research has examined more basic social cognition  abilities that might underlie this association. To that end, this study examined  the associations of interpersonal violence exposure with cognitive and affective  theory of mind (ToM), core social-cognitive processes that underlie many aspects  of social information processing. In addition, we evaluated whether difficulties  with ToM were associated with externalizing psychopathology. Data were collected  in a community-based sample of 246 children and adolescents aged 8-16 who had a  high concentration of exposure to interpersonal violence. Violence exposure was  associated with lower accuracy during cognitive and affective ToM, and the  associations persisted after adjusting for co-occurring forms of adversity  characterized by deprivation, including poverty and emotional neglect. Poor ToM  performance, in turn, was associated with externalizing behaviors. These  findings shed light on novel pathways that increase risk for aggression in  children who have experienced violence.

Children's learning and development in conflict- and crisis-affected countries:  Building a science for action.	Aber JL(1), Tubbs Dolan C(1), Kim HY(1), Brown L(1).	Author information: (1)Institute of Human Development and Social Change (IHDSC), New York  University, New York, NY, USA.	This paper critically reviews the opportunities and challenges in designing and  conducting actionable research on the learning and development of children in  conflict- and crisis-affected countries. We approached our review through two  perspectives championed by Edward Zigler: (a) child development and social  policy and (b) developmental psychopathology in context. The aim of the work was  to answer the following questions: What works to enhance children's learning and  development in such contexts? By what mechanisms? For whom? Under what  conditions? How do experiences and conditions of crisis affect the basic  processes of children's typical development? The review is based on a  research-practice partnership started in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in  2010 and expanded to research in Niger and Lebanon in 2016. The focus of the  research is on the impact of Healing Classrooms (a set of classroom practices)  and Healing Classrooms Plus (an additional set of targeted social and emotional  learning activities), developed by the International Rescue Committee, on  children's academic outcomes and social and emotional learning. We sought to  extract lessons from this decade of research for building a global developmental  science for action. Special attention is paid to the importance of  research-practice partnerships, conceptual frameworks, measurement and  methodology. We conclude by highlighting several essential features of a global  developmental science for action.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001789 PMID: 33402231

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology,University of California,Davis, Davis, CA,USA.	Emotion dysregulation is defined as patterns of emotional experience or  expression that interfere with goal-directed activity. This paper considers this  functionalist definition from a developmental perspective with the goal of  elaborating this approach with respect to its central questions. What are the  goals that are impeded by emotionally dysregulated responding, and what  alternative goals might motivate emotion dysregulation? What are the  developmental processes by which these goals take shape, and what are the  influences of the family context, and especially of central relationships in the  family, in their emergence? How does this functionalist account address the  complex interaction of experience and developing biological processes that also  influence emotion regulation and dysregulation? Drawing on research literature  concerning children at risk for affective psychopathology and considering  relevant examples of the interaction of biology and context, this discussion  offers a portrayal of emotion dysregulation as a biologically dynamic,  experience-based aspect of adaptation to environments and relationships that, in  conditions of risk for the emergence of developmental psychopathology, motivates  patterns of emotional responding that serve immediate coping often at the cost  of long-term maladaptation. Implications for emotions theory and the study of  developmental psychopathology are also considered.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419000282 PMID: 31030684 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Little is known about the effect of natural disasters on children's neural  development. Additionally, despite evidence that stress and parenting may both  influence the development of neural systems underlying reward and threat  processing, few studies have brought together these areas of research. The  current investigation examined the effect of parenting styles and  hurricane-related stress on the development of neural reactivity to reward and  threat in children. Approximately 8 months before and 9 months after Hurricane  Sandy, 74 children experiencing high and low levels of hurricane-related stress  completed tasks that elicited the reward positivity and error-related  negativity, event-related potentials indexing sensitivity to reward and threat,  respectively. At the post-Hurricane assessment, children completed a self-report  questionnaire to measure promotion- and prevention-focused parenting styles.  Among children exposed to high levels of hurricane-related stress, lower levels  of promotion-focused, but not prevention-focused, parenting were associated with  a reduced post-Sandy reward positivity. In addition, in children with high  stress exposure, greater prevention-focused, but not promotion-focused,  parenting was associated with a larger error-related negativity after Hurricane  Sandy. These findings highlight the need to consider contextual variables such  as parenting when examining how exposure to stress alters the development of  neural reactivity to reward and threat in children.

Cross FL(1), Hoffman AJ(1), Constante K(1), Rivas-Drake D(1).	Author information: (1)University of Michigan.	The current study examined the concurrent and prospective associations of  ethnic-racial identity content (i.e., centrality, private regard, and public  regard) and depressive symptomatology among Latino adolescents. Data were drawn  from a longitudinal study of Latino adolescents (N = 148, 53.4% girls) who were  13-14 years old at Wave 1. Results indicated that higher ethnic-racial  centrality at Waves 1 and 2 predicted fewer depressive symptoms at Waves 2 and  3, respectively. In addition, more positive private regard at Wave 1 predicted  fewer depressive symptoms at Wave 2, and more positive public regard at Wave 2  predicted fewer symptoms at Wave 3. Thus, ethnic-racial identity content may  serve as a cultural protective factor that is linked to diminished depressive  symptomatology among Latino youth.

Disentangling genes, attachment, and environment: A systematic review of the  developmental psychopathology literature on gene-environment interactions and  attachment.	Golds L(1), de Kruiff K(1), MacBeth A(1).	Author information: (1)School of Health in Social Science, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.	The role of genetics in relation to attachment is of continued interest to  developmental psychology. Recent research has attempted to disentangle genetic  main effects, environmental effects, and gene and environment (G × E)  interactions in the development of attachment security/insecurity and  disorganization. We systematically reviewed associations between gene markers  and attachment, including G × E interactions, identifying 27 eligible studies.  Inconsistent results emerged for associations between both gene effects and G ×  E interactions on attachment organization. Where G × E interactions used  attachment as the environmental factor in the interaction, we observed more  consistent results for differential susceptibility of G × E interactions on  offspring behavior. Small sample size and heterogeneity in measurement of  environmental factors impacted on comparability of studies. From these results,  we propose that the future of research into the role of genetic effects in  attachment lies in further exploration of G × E interactions, particularly where  attachment acts as an environmental factor impacting on other child  developmental outcomes emerging from the caregiving environment, consistent with  differential susceptibility approaches to developmental psychopathology. In  addition, from a methodological perspective, establishing the role of gene  markers in such models will require a shift toward contemporary genomics,  including genome-wide analysis (including novel genes and chromosomal loci), and  epigenetic individual variations.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology,Pennsylvania State University, University  Park,PA,USA. (2)Department of Human Development and Family Studies,Pennsylvania State  University, University Park,PA,USA.	In this article we adopt the view that emotion dysregulation is characterized by  emotion regulation dynamics that are defined as dysfunctional based on  contextual criteria. We regard the construct of emotion regulation as valuable  because it permits the integration of the classic view of emotions as  interfering with human functioning and contemporary views of emotion as adaptive  and beneficial. To define patterns that reflect emotion dysregulation, we  explain our views of emotion as a dynamic process, and emotion regulation as the  bidirectional interplay between emotions and actions/thoughts (extrinsic  factors) and the contextual factors that constitute the criteria for that  interplay reflecting dysregulation. This conceptualization of emotion regulation  and dysregulation leads to methods for studying the intrinsic dynamics of  emotion, extrinsic factors that change the intrinsic dynamics of emotion, and  how emotion regulation changes over time at multiple time scales. We then apply  this thinking to several emotion dysregulation patterns. Emotion regulation is a  complex construct, embracing emotion as regulator and as regulated, as self- and  other-regulated, and as incorporating both top-down and bottom-up regulatory  processes. We highlight an emerging line of research on the development of  emotion regulation in early childhood and indicate how this work can inform  understanding of emotion dysregulation and the emergence of psychopathology.

Bradley Hospital. (3)Emory University. (4)Butler Hospital. (5)Yale University School of Medicine.	Serotonin signaling pathways play a key role in brain development, stress  reactivity, and mental health. Epigenetic alterations in the serotonin system  may underlie the effect of early life stress on psychopathology. The current  study examined methylation of the serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A) gene in a sample  of 228 children including 119 with child welfare documentation of moderate to  severe maltreatment within the last 6 months. Child protection records,  semistructured interviews in the home, and parent reports were used to assess  child stress exposure, psychiatric symptoms, and behavior. The HTR2A genotype  and methylation of HTR2A were measured at two CpG sites (-1420 and -1224) from  saliva DNA. HTR2A genotype was associated with HTR2A methylation at both CpG  sites. HTR2A genotype also moderated associations of contextual stress exposure  and HTR2A methylation at site -1420. Contextual stress was positively associated  with -1420 methylation among A homozygotes, but negatively associated with -1420  methylation among G homozygotes. Posttraumatic stress disorder and major  depressive disorder symptoms were negatively associated with methylation at  -1420, but positively associated with methylation at -1224. Results support the  view that the serotonin system is sensitive to stress exposure and  psychopathology, and HTR2A methylation may be a mechanism by which early  adversity is biologically encoded.

Using multilevel models, we examined mother-, father-, and child-reported (N =  1,336 families) externalizing behavior problem trajectories from age 7 to 14 in  nine countries (China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, Sweden,  Thailand, and the United States). The intercept and slope of children's  externalizing behavior trajectories varied both across individuals within  culture and across cultures, and the variance was larger at the individual level  than at the culture level. Mothers' and children's endorsement of aggression as  well as mothers' authoritarian attitudes predicted higher age 8 intercepts of  child externalizing behaviors. Furthermore, prediction from individual-level  endorsement of aggression and authoritarian attitudes to more child  externalizing behaviors was augmented by prediction from cultural-level  endorsement of aggression and authoritarian attitudes, respectively. Cultures in  which father-reported endorsement of aggression was higher and both mother- and  father-reported authoritarian attitudes were higher also reported more child  externalizing behavior problems at age 8. Among fathers, greater attributions  regarding uncontrollable success in caregiving situations were associated with  steeper declines in externalizing over time. Understanding cultural-level as  well as individual-level correlates of children's externalizing behavior offers  potential insights into prevention and intervention efforts that can be more  effectively targeted at individual children and parents as well as targeted at  changing cultural norms that increase the risk of children's and adolescents'  externalizing behavior.

The World Health Organization recently reported that maternal mental health is a  major public health concern. As many as one in four women suffer from  psychiatric disorders at some point during pregnancy or the first postpartum  year. Furthermore, self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) represent one  of the leading causes of death among women during this time. Thus, efforts to  identify women at risk for serious forms of psychopathology and especially for  SITBs are of utmost importance. Despite this urgency, current single-diagnostic  approaches fail to recognize a significant subset of women who are vulnerable to  perinatal stress and distress. The current study was among the first to  investigate emotion dysregulation-a multilevel, transdiagnostic risk factor for  psychopathology-and its associations with stress, distress, and SITBs in a  sample of pregnant women (26-40 weeks gestation) recruited to reflect a range of  emotion dysregulation. Both self-reported emotion dysregulation and respiratory  sinus arrhythmia, a biomarker of emotion dysregulation, demonstrated expected  associations with measures of mental health, including depression, anxiety,  borderline personality pathology, and SITBs. In addition, self-reported emotion  dysregulation was associated with blunted respiratory sinus arrhythmia  responsivity to an ecologically valid infant cry task. Findings add to the  literature considering transdiagnostic risk during pregnancy using a  multiple-levels-of-analysis approach.

It is possible that variation in neural functional  system connectivity in utero predicts individual differences in infant  behavioral development, but this possibility has yet to be examined. The current  study examines the association between fetal sensorimotor brain system  functional connectivity and infant postnatal motor ability. Resting-state  functional connectivity data was obtained in 96 healthy human fetuses during the  second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Infant motor ability was measured 7  months after birth using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Increased  connectivity between the emerging motor network and regions of the prefrontal  cortex, temporal lobes, posterior cingulate, and supplementary motor regions was  observed in infants that showed more mature motor functions. In addition,  females demonstrated stronger fetal-brain to infant-behavior associations. These  observations extend prior longitudinal research back into prenatal brain  development and raise exciting new ideas about the advent of risk and the  ontogeny of early sex differences.

Prenatal programming models have rarely been applied to research on children  with prenatal substance exposure, despite evidence suggesting that prenatal drug  exposure is a form of stress that impacts neurodevelopmental outcomes and risk  for psychopathology. Utilizing data from two longitudinal multisite studies  comprising children prenatally exposed to substances as well as a nonexposed  comparison group (Maternal Lifestyle Study, n = 1,388; Infant Development,  Environment, and Lifestyle study, n = 412), we tested whether early phenotypic  indicators of hypothesized programming effects, indexed by growth parameters at  birth and infant temperament, served as a link between prenatal substance  exposure and internalizing and externalizing behavior at age 5. Latent profile  analysis indicated that individual differences in reactivity and regulation for  infants prenatally exposed to substances was best characterized by four  temperament profiles. These profiles were virtually identical across two  independent samples, and demonstrated unique associations with adjustment  difficulties nearly 5 years later. Results of path analysis using structural  equation modeling also showed that increased prenatal substance exposure was  linked to poorer growth parameters at birth, profiles of temperamental  reactivity in infancy, and internalizing and externalizing behavior at age 5.  This pathway was partially replicated across samples. This study was among the  first to link known individual-level correlates of prenatal substance exposure  into a specific pathway to childhood problem behavior. Implications for the  developmental origins of a child's susceptibility to psychopathology as a result  of intrauterine substance exposure are discussed.

Author information: (1)Chapman University. (2)University of California,Irvine. (3)University of California,Los Angeles.	The fetal phase of life has long been recognized as a sensitive period of  development. Here we posit that pregnancy represents a simultaneous sensitive  period for the adult female with broad and persisting consequences for her  health and development, including risk for psychopathology. In this review, we  examine the transition to motherhood through the lens of developmental  psychopathology. Specifically, we summarize the typical and atypical changes in  brain and behavior that characterize the perinatal period. We highlight how the  exceptional neuroplasticity exhibited by women during this life phase may  account for increased vulnerability for psychopathology. Further, we discuss  several modes of signaling that are available to the fetus to affect maternal  phenotypes (hormones, motor activity, and gene transfer) and also illustrate how  evolutionary perspectives can help explain how and why fetal functions may  contribute to maternal psychopathology. The developmental psychopathology  perspective has spurred advances in understanding risk and resilience for mental  health in many domains. As such, it is surprising that this major epoch in the  female life span has yet to benefit fully from similar applications.

Early socioemotional competence, psychopathology, and latent class profiles of  reparative prosocial behaviors from preschool through early adolescence.	Donohue MR(1), Tillman R(1), Luby J(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint  Louis, MO, USA.	Children who have difficulty using reparative behaviors following transgressions  display a wide range of poorer social and emotional outcomes. Despite the  importance of reparative skills, no study has charted the developmental  trajectory of these behaviors or pinpointed predictors of poorer reparative  abilities. To address these gaps in the literature, this study applied growth  mixture modeling to parent reports of children's reparative behaviors (N = 230)  in a 9-year longitudinal data set spanning from preschool to early adolescence.  Three distinct trajectories of reparative behaviors were found: a low-stable,  moderate-stable, and high-stable latent class. Poorer emotion understanding,  social withdrawal, social rejection, and maladaptive guilt in the preschool  period predicted membership in a low-stable reparative trajectory. Externalizing  diagnoses, particularly conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, also  predicted membership in a low-stable reparative trajectory. Preschool-onset  depression predicted membership in a low-stable reparative trajectory through  high levels of maladaptive guilt. The findings from this study suggest that  socioemotional deficits in the preschool period set children on longstanding  trajectories of impaired reparative responding. Thus, emotion understanding,  social functioning, maladaptive guilt, and early psychiatric symptoms should be  targeted in early preventive interventions.

Gartstein MA(1), Skinner MK(1).	Author information: (1)Washington State University.	This review summarizes current knowledge and outlines future directions relevant  to questions concerning environmental epigenetics and the processes that  contribute to temperament development. Links between prenatal adversity,  epigenetic programming, and early manifestations of temperament are important in  their own right, also informing our understanding of biological foundations for  social-emotional development. In addition, infant temperament attributes  represent key etiological factors in the onset of developmental psychopathology,  and studies elucidating their prenatal foundations expand our understanding of  developmental origins of health and disease. Prenatal adversity can take many  forms, and this overview is focused on the environmental effects of stress,  toxicants, substance use/psychotropic medication, and nutrition. Dysregulation  associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity-disruptive disorders was noted  in the context of maternal substance use and toxicant exposures during  gestation, as well as stress. Although these links can be made based on the  existing literature, currently few studies directly connect environmental  influences, epigenetic programming, and changes in brain development/behavior.  The chain of events starting with environmental inputs and resulting in  alterations to gene expression, physiology, and behavior of the organism is  driven by epigenetics. Epigenetics provides the molecular mechanism of how  environmental factors impact development and subsequent health and disease,  including early brain and temperament development.

Mutual synergies between reactive and active inhibitory systems of temperament  in the development of children's disruptive behavior: Two longitudinal studies.	An D(1), Kochanska G(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa  City, IA, USA.	Individual differences in two inhibitory temperament systems have been  implicated as key in the development of early disruptive behaviors. The reactive  inhibition system, behavioral inhibition (BI) entails fearfulness, shyness,  timidity, and caution. The active inhibition system, or effortful control (EC)  entails a capacity to deliberately suppress, modify, or regulate a predominant  behavior. Lower scores in each system have been associated with more disruptive  behaviors. We examined how the two systems interact, and whether one can  alleviate or exacerbate risks due to the other. In two community samples (Study  1, N = 112, ages 2.5 to 4, and Study 2, N = 102, ages 2 to 6.5), we assessed  early BI and EC, and future disruptive behaviors (observed disregard for rules  in Study 1 and parent-rated externalizing problems in Study 2). Robustly  replicated interactions revealed that for children with low BI (relatively  fearless), better EC was associated with less disruptive behavior; for children  with low EC, more BI was associated with less disruptive behavior. This research  extends the investigation of Temperament × Temperament interactions in  developmental psychology and psychopathology, and it suggests that reactive and  active inhibition systems may play mutually compensatory roles. Those effects  emerged after age 2.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001534 PMID: 33342456

A review and analysis of the components of potentially effective perinatal  mental health interventions for infant development and mother-infant  relationship outcomes.	Newton K(1), Taylor Buck E(1), Weich S(1), Uttley L(1).	Author information: (1)School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), University of Sheffield,  Sheffield, UK.	Children of mothers with serious mental health difficulties are at increased  risk of developing mental health difficulties themselves in their own lifetime.  Specialist interventions delivered in perinatal mental health services offer an  opportunity to support the infant's development and long-term mental health.  This review aimed to systematically evaluate the shared elements of successful  perinatal mental health interventions that underpin improved outcomes for  infants whose mothers experience perinatal mental health difficulties. Nine  electronic databases were searched comprehensively for relevant controlled  studies of perinatal mental health interventions, and a narrative synthesis  undertaken to assess whether statistically significant benefits were noted.  Sixteen studies, trialing 19 interventions, were analyzed using a narrative  approach and grouped according to reported effectiveness. Eight interventions  demonstrated significant improvements in infant outcomes and/or mother-infant  relationship outcomes and were used to inform the analysis of the included  interventions' components. While the interventions identified were diverse,  there were common components which potentially underpin successful interventions  for infants whose mothers are experiencing mental health difficulties,  including: facilitation of positive Mother×Infant interactions; helping mothers  to understand their infant's perspective or inner world; and the use of video  feedback.

Development of aggressive-victims from childhood through adolescence:  Associations with emotion dysregulation, withdrawn behaviors, moral  disengagement, peer rejection, and friendships.	Ettekal I(1), Ladd GW(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Educational Psychology, Texas A&M University, College Station,  TX, USA. (2)Sanford School and Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe,  AZ, USA.	At multiple developmental periods spanning from middle childhood through  adolescence, we investigated the development of aggressive-victims.  Multiple-informant data collected across four grade levels (1, 5, 8, and 11; N =  482; 50% females) was used to perform person-centered analyses including latent  profile and latent transition analyses in order to examine the co-occurring  development of multiple forms (i.e., physical, verbal, and relational) of  aggression and peer victimization. Results indicated that there were two  distinct subgroups of aggressive-victims, one of which was more relational in  form (i.e., relational aggressive-victims), and children in these two subgroups  were distinguishable with respect to their individual characteristics (emotion  dysregulation, withdrawn behaviors, and moral disengagement) and relational  experiences (peer rejection and friendships). Furthermore, the findings  elucidated the mechanisms by which developmental continuity and change (i.e.,  transitions) among the subgroups occurred across childhood and adolescence.

The impacts of maternal childhood adversity, stress, and mental health on child  development at 6 months in Taiwan: A follow-up study.	Chang YT(1), Feng JY(1), Chang HY(1), Chang YC(2), Lee CK(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Nursing, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University,  Taiwan. (2)Department of Nursing, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of  Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan.	Exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is not only associated with  one's adverse health outcomes in adulthood but also increases the risk of child  developmental problems in offspring. However, the mechanisms involved in the  transmission of the effects of maternal ACEs to the offspring largely remain  unexplored. This study sought to identify possible psychosocial pathways of  intergenerational effects of maternal ACEs on child development at 6 months.  Data from a longitudinal study on maternal childhood adversity and maternal  psychosocial risk during pregnancy as well as maternal mental health problems  and child development at 6 months postnatal were used. Structural equation  modeling with bootstrapping was used to estimate the indirect effects of  maternal ACEs on child development at 6 months. The model showed that maternal  ACEs indirectly influenced offspring's development via maternal stressful events  during pregnancy and pre- and postnatal mental health problems. This finding  highlights the possible interventions at the prenatal and postnatal periods.  Early identification of women who have ACEs or who are at psychosocial risk  during pre- and postnatal periods is critical to provide interventions to buffer  those negative effects on offspring's development. Future studies are needed to  longitudinally assess the effects of maternal ACEs on child development over  time.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000267 PMID: 32684201

Dismukes A(1), Shirtcliff E(1), Jones CW(2), Zeanah C(2), Theall K(2), Drury  S(2).	Author information: (1)Iowa State University. (2)Tulane University.	Acute reactivity of the stress hormone cortisol is reflective of early adversity  and stress exposure, with some studies finding that the impact of adversity on  the stress response differs by race. The objectives of the current study were to  characterize cortisol reactivity to two dyadically based stress paradigms across  the first year of life, to examine cortisol reactivity within Black and White  infants, and to assess the impact of correlates of racial inequity including  socioeconomic status, experiences of discrimination, and urban life stressors,  as well as the buffering by racial socialization on cortisol patterns. Salivary  cortisol reactivity was assessed at 4 months of age during the Still Face  paradigm (N = 207) and at 12 months of age across the Strange Situation  procedure (N = 129). Infants demonstrated the steepest recovery after the Still  Face paradigm and steepest reactivity to the Strange Situation procedure. Race  differences in cortisol were not present at 4 months but emerged at 12 months of  age, with Black infants having higher cortisol. Experiences of discrimination  contributed to cortisol differences within Black infants, suggesting that racial  discrimination is already "under the skin" by 1 year of age. These findings  suggest that race-related differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  reactivity are present in infancy, and that the first year of life is a crucial  time period during which interventions and prevention efforts for  maternal-infant dyads are most likely able to shape  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal reactivity thereby mitigating health disparities  early across the life course.

Moral reasoning and decision making help guide behavior and facilitate  interpersonal relationships. Accounts of morality that position commonsense  psychology as the foundation of moral development, (i.e., rationalist theories)  have dominated research in morality in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Given the  well-documented differences in commonsense psychology among autistic  individuals, researchers have investigated whether the development and execution  of moral judgement and reasoning differs in this population compared with  neurotypical individuals. In light of the diverse findings of investigations of  moral development and reasoning in ASD, a summation and critical evaluation of  the literature could help make sense of what is known about this important  social-cognitive skill in ASD. To that end, we conducted a systematic review of  the literature investigating moral decision making among autistic children and  adults. Our search identified 29 studies. In this review, we synthesize the  research in the area and provide suggestions for future research. Such research  could include the application of an alternative theoretical framework to  studying morality in autism spectrum disorder that does not assume a  deficits-based perspective.

Distinct emotion regulation skills explain psychopathology and problems in  social relationships following childhood emotional abuse and neglect.	Berzenski SR(1).	Author information: (1)California State University,Northridge.	Efforts to differentiate between the developmental sequelae of childhood  emotional abuse and childhood emotional neglect are critical to both research  and practice efforts. As an oft-identified mechanism of the effects of child  maltreatment on later adjustment, emotion dysregulation represents a key  potential pathway. The present study explored a higher order factor model of  specific emotion regulation skills, and the extent to which these skill sets  would indicate distinct developmental pathways from unique emotional  maltreatment experiences to multidomain adjustment. A sample of 500  ethnoracially diverse college students reported on their experiences. A  two-factor model of emotion regulation skills based on subscales of the  Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale was revealed. Significant indirect  effects of childhood emotional abuse on psychopathology and problems in social  relationships were found through response-focused difficulties in emotion  regulation, whereas a significant indirect effect of childhood emotional neglect  on problems in social relationships was found through antecedent-focused  difficulties in emotion regulation. These results are consistent with  theoretical models and empirical evidence suggesting differential effects of  childhood emotional abuse and emotional neglect, and provide an important  indication for developing targeted interventions focusing on specific higher  order emotion dysregulation skill clusters.

Testing the cultural  similarities hypothesis on psychopathology with a second-order meta-analysis.	Causadias JM(1), Korous KM(1), Cahill KM(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University.	The cultural differences hypothesis is the assertion that there are large  differences between Whites and racial/ethnic minorities in the United States,  while there are small differences between- (e.g., African Americans and Latinos)  and within- (e.g., Latinos: Mexican Americans and Cuban Americans) minority  groups. Conversely, the cultural similarities hypothesis argues that there are  small differences between Whites and minorities, and these differences are equal  or smaller in magnitude than differences between and within minorities. In this  study, we conducted a second-order meta-analysis focused on psychopathology, to  (a) test these hypotheses by estimating the absolute average difference between  Whites and minorities, as well as between and within minorities, on levels of  psychopathology, and (b) determine if general and meta-analytic method  moderators account for these differences. A systematic search in PsycINFO, Web  of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations identified 16 meta-analyses (13%  unpublished) on 493 primary studies (N = 3,036,749). Differences between Whites  and minorities (d+ = 0.23, 95% confidence interval [0.18, 0.28]), and between  minorities (d+ = 0.30, 95% confidence interval [0.12, 0.48]) were small in  magnitude. White-minority differences remained small across moderators. These  findings support the cultural similarities hypothesis. We discuss their  implications and future research directions.

Despite public sentiment to the contrary, recreational marijuana use is  deleterious to adolescent health and development. Prospective studies of  marijuana use trajectories and their predictors are needed to differentiate risk  profiles and inform intervention strategies. Using data on 15,960 participants  in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health,  variable-centered approaches were used to examine the impact of childhood  polyvictimization on marijuana onset, marijuana use from age 15 to 24 years, and  marijuana dependence symptoms. Zero-Inflated Poisson latent class growth  analysis (ZIP-LCGA) was used to identify marijuana use subgroups, and their  associations with childhood polyvictimization were tested via multinomial logit  regression within ZIP-LCGA. Results showed that the overall probability and  frequency of marijuana use increased throughout adolescence, peaked in early  adulthood, and diminished gradually thereafter. Polyvictimization was associated  with earlier onset and greater overall use, frequency of use, and dependence  symptoms. ZIP-LCGA uncovered four subgroups, including non-users and three  classes of users: adolescence-limited users, escalators, and chronic users.  Polyvictimization distinguished non-users from all classes of marijuana users.  The findings underscore the lasting developmental implications of significant  childhood trauma. Children who experience polyvictimization represent a group  that may benefit from selective interventions aimed at preventing early,  frequent, chronic, and dependent marijuana use.

(3)Albany School of Public Health.	Using a population-based birth cohort in upstate New York (2008-2010), we  examined the determinants of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) measured  in newborn dried blood spots (n = 2,637). We also examined the association  between neonatal BDNF and children's development. The cohort was initially  designed to examine the influence of infertility treatment on child development  but found no impact. Mothers rated children's development in five domains  repeatedly through age 3 years. Socioeconomic and maternal lifestyle  determinants of BDNF were examined using multivariable linear regression models.  Generalized linear mixed models estimated odds ratios for neonatal BDNF in  relation to failing a developmental domain. Smoking and drinking in pregnancy,  nulliparity, non-White ethnicity/race, and prepregnancy obesity were associated  with lower neonatal BDNF. Neonatal BDNF was not associated with failure for  developmental domains; however, there was an interaction between BDNF and  preterm birth. In preterm infants, a higher BDNF was associated with lower odds  of failing any developmental domains, after adjusting for confounders and  infertility treatment. This result was particularly significant for failure in  communication. Our findings suggest that BDNF levels in neonates may be impacted  by maternal lifestyle characteristics. More specifically, lower neonatal BDNF  might be an early marker of aberrant neurodevelopment in preterm infants.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417000414 PMCID: PMC6201316 PMID: 28462726 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Sequences of maladaptation: Preadolescent self-regulation, adolescent negative  social interactions, and young adult psychopathology.	Laceulle OM(1), Veenstra R(2), Vollebergh WAM(1), Ormel J(2).	Author information: (1)Utrecht University. (2)University of Groningen.	This study aims to test whether adolescent negative social interactions mediate  the relation between early adolescent self-regulatory capacities and young adult  psychopathology, using a fully prospective mediation model. Data were derived  from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a large population  cohort of Dutch adolescents (n = 962). At age 11, three indicators of  self-regulation were assessed: low frustration, high effortful control, and high  response inhibition. Negative social interactions between ages 11 and 22 were  captured twice using the Event History Calendar. Psychopathology (i.e.,  internalizing and externalizing problems) was assessed at ages 11 and 22.  Findings indicate that adolescents' frustration and effortful control but not  response inhibition assessed at age 11 are related to both internalizing and  externalizing problems at age 22, after controlling for psychopathology at age  11, sex, and socioeconomic status. These associations were partly (about 22%)  mediated by the negative social interactions adolescents experienced. Effect  sizes were all modest. This study shows that self-regulation is related to  subsequent psychopathology in part through its effect on negative social  interactions, providing evidence for sequences of self-regulatory capacities,  life experiences, and developmental outcomes.

(5)Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. (6)Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.	Although early-life adversity can undermine healthy development, children  growing up in harsh environments may develop intact, or even enhanced, skills  for solving problems in high-adversity contexts (i.e., "hidden talents"). Here  we situate the hidden talents model within a larger interdisciplinary framework.  Summarizing theory and research on hidden talents, we propose that  stress-adapted skills represent a form of adaptive intelligence that enables  individuals to function within the constraints of harsh, unpredictable  environments. We discuss the alignment of the hidden talents model with current  knowledge about human brain development following early adversity; examine  potential applications of this perspective to multiple sectors concerned with  youth from harsh environments, including education, social services, and  juvenile justice; and compare the hidden talents model with contemporary  developmental resilience models. We conclude that the hidden talents approach  offers exciting new directions for research on developmental adaptations to  childhood adversity, with translational implications for leveraging  stress-adapted skills to more effectively tailor education, jobs, and  interventions to fit the needs and potentials of individuals from a diverse  range of life circumstances. This approach affords a well-rounded view of people  who live with adversity that avoids stigma and communicates a novel,  distinctive, and strength-based message.

Inhibitory control (IC) deficits have been associated with psychiatric symptoms  in all ages. However, longitudinal studies testing the direction of the  associations in childhood are scarce. We used a sample of 2,874 children (7 to 9  years old) to test the following three hypotheses: (a) IC deficits are an  underlying risk factor with a potentially causal role for psychopathology, (b)  IC deficits are a complication of psychopathology, and (c) IC deficits and  psychopathology are associated at the trait level but not necessarily causally  related. We used the go/no-go task to assess IC, the parent-rated Strengths and  Difficulties Questionnaire to evaluate externalizing/internalizing symptoms, and  the random intercepts cross-lagged panel model to test the hypotheses. The  results showed no support for the underlying risk factor hypothesis, suggesting  that IC unlikely has a causal role in this age group's psychopathology. The  complication hypothesis received support for externalizing symptoms, suggesting  that externalizing symptoms may hamper the normal development of IC. IC deficits  and both externalizing and internalizing symptoms were correlated at the trait  level, indicating a possible common origin. We suggest that it may be useful to  support children with externalizing symptoms to promote and protect their IC  development.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000176 PMID: 32662373

From early care and education to adult problem behaviors: A prevention pathway  through after-school organized activities.	Vandell DL(1), Simpkins SD(1), Liu Y(1).	Author information: (1)School of Education, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.	Motivated by Edward Zigler's proposition that programs serving children (birth  through 12 years) can have long-term effects on well-being and development, we  used data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1,258) to test two  pathways by which early care and education (ECE) are linked to after-school  organized activities in middle childhood and to problem behaviors in late  adolescence and adulthood. In support of an activities pathway, we found  children with more ECE hours and more epochs in center-based ECE settings from 1  to 54 months had more epochs in after-school organized activities from  kindergarten to 5th grade, which then predicted less impulsivity and less police  contact at age 26. In support of a child pathway, we found that more ECE hours  and more epochs in center-based ECE settings were linked to externalizing  problems in early childhood, which then predicted higher problem behaviors in  middle childhood, late adolescence, and adulthood. Together, these pathways  underscored the potential of direct and indirect links of ECE and after-school  organized activities in relation to later development.

Conventional longitudinal behavioral genetic models estimate the relative  contribution of genetic and environmental factors to stability and change of  traits and behaviors. Longitudinal models rarely explain the processes that  generate observed differences between genetically and socially related  individuals. We propose that exchanges between individuals and their  environments (i.e., phenotype-environment effects) can explain the emergence of  observed differences over time. Phenotype-environment models, however, would  require violation of the independence assumption of standard behavioral genetic  models; that is, uncorrelated genetic and environmental factors. We review how  specification of phenotype-environment effects contributes to understanding  observed changes in genetic variability over time and longitudinal correlations  among nonshared environmental factors. We then provide an example using 30 days  of positive and negative affect scores from an all-female sample of twins.  Results demonstrate that the phenotype-environment effects explain how  heritability estimates fluctuate as well as how nonshared environmental factors  persist over time. We discuss possible mechanisms underlying change in  gene-environment correlation over time, the advantages and challenges of  including gene-environment correlation in longitudinal twin models, and  recommendations for future research.

Author information: (1)University of California,Davis.	Two sets of evidence reviewed herein, one indicating that prenatal stress is  associated with elevated behavioral and physiological dysregulation and the  other that such phenotypic functioning is itself associated with heightened  susceptibility to positive and negative environmental influences postnatally,  raises the intriguing hypothesis first advanced by Pluess and Belsky (2011) that  prenatal stress fosters, promotes, or "programs" postnatal developmental  plasticity. Here we review further evidence consistent with this proposition,  including new experimental research systematically manipulating both prenatal  stress and postnatal rearing. Collectively this work would seem to explain why  prenatal stress has so consistently been linked to problematic development:  stresses encountered prenatally are likely to continue postnatally, thereby  adversely affecting the development of children programmed (by prenatal stress)  to be especially susceptible to environmental effects. Less investigated are the  potential benefits prenatal stress may promote, due to increased plasticity,  when the postnatal environment proves to be favorable. Future directions of  research pertaining to potential mechanisms instantiating postnatal plasticity  and moderators of such prenatal-programming effects are outlined.

Alexithymia is a personality construct characterized by difficulties in  identifying and verbalizing feelings, a restricted imagination, and an  externally oriented thinking style. As alexithymia shows marked overlap with  depression, its independent nature as a personality construct is still being  debated. The etiology of alexithymia is unknown, although childhood emotional  neglect and attachment formation are thought to play important roles. In the  FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study, experiences of early-life adversities (EA) and  childhood maltreatment (CM) were studied in a sample of 2,604 men and women. The  overlap and differences between depression and alexithymia were investigated by  comparing their associations with EA types and adult attachment style.  Alexithymia was specifically associated with childhood emotional neglect (odds  ratio (OR) 3.8, p < .001), whereas depression was related to several types of  EA. In depression co-occurring with alexithymia, there was a higher prevalence  of emotional neglect (81.3% vs. 54.4%, p < .001), attachment anxiety (t = 2.38,  p = .018), and attachment avoidance (t = 4.03, p < .001). Early-life adversities  were markedly different in the alexithymia group compared to those suffering  from depression, or healthy controls. Depression with concurrent alexithymia may  represent a distinct subtype, specifically associated with childhood experiences  of emotional neglect, and increased attachment insecurity compared to  non-alexithymic depression.

This paper examines the misalignment between modern human society and certain  male phenotypes, a misalignment that has been highlighted and explored in great  detail in the work of Tom Dishion. We begin by briefly enumerating the ongoing  developmental difficulties of many boys and young men and how these difficulties  affect them and those around them. We then suggest that the qualities that have  been advantageous for men and their families in our earlier evolution but that  are often no longer functional in modern society are a source of these problems.  Finally, we provide a brief review of prevention programs that can contribute to  preventing this type of problematic development and eliciting more prosocial  behavior from at-risk boys and men. We conclude with an overview of research and  policy priorities that could contribute to reducing the proportion of boys and  young men who experience developmental difficulties in making their way in the  world.

To illuminate which features of an unpredictable environment early in life best  forecast adolescent and adult functioning, data from two longitudinal studies  were examined. After decomposing a composite unpredictability construct found to  predict later development, results of both studies revealed that paternal  transitions predicted outcomes more consistently and strongly than did  residential or occupational changes across the first 5 years of a child's life.  These results derive from analyses of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and  Youth Development, which included diverse families from 10 different sites in  the United States, and from the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and  Adaptation, whose participants came from one site, were disproportionately  economically disadvantaged, and were enrolled 15 years earlier than the NICHD  Study sample. The finding that results from both studies are consistent with  evolutionary, life history thinking regarding the importance of males in  children's lives makes this general, cross-study replication noteworthy.

Psychotropic medication use and psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy each are  associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring. Commonly,  studies considering medication effects do not adequately assess symptoms, nor  evaluate children when the effects are believed to occur, the fetal period. This  study examined maternal serotonin reuptake inhibitor and polypharmacy use in  relation to serial assessments of five indices of fetal neurobehavior and Bayley  Scales of Infant Development at 12 months in N = 161 socioeconomically  advantaged, non-Hispanic White women with a shared risk phenotype, diagnosed  major depressive disorder. On average fetuses showed the expected development  over gestation. In contrast, infant average Bayley psychomotor and mental  development scores were low (M = 84.10 and M = 89.92, range of normal limits  85-114) with rates of delay more than 2-3 times what would be expected based on  this measure's normative data. Controlling for prenatal and postnatal depressive  symptoms, prenatal medication effects on neurobehavioral development were  largely undetected in the fetus and infant. Mental health care directed  primarily at symptoms may not address the additional psychosocial needs of women  parenting infants. Speculatively, prenatal serotonin reuptake inhibitor exposure  may act as a plasticity rather than risk factor, potentially enhancing  receptivity to a nonoptimal postnatal environment in some mother-infant dyads.

Early behaviors that differentiate later biomarkers for psychopathology can  guide preventive efforts while also facilitating pathophysiological research. We  tested whether error-related negativity (ERN) moderates the link between early  behavior and later psychopathology in two early childhood phenotypes: behavioral  inhibition and irritability. From ages 2 to 7 years, children (n = 291) were  assessed longitudinally for behavioral inhibition (BI) and irritability.  Behavioral inhibition was assessed via maternal report and behavioral responses  to novelty. Childhood irritability was assessed using the Child Behavior  Checklist. At age 12, an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while children  performed a flanker task to measure ERN, a neural indicator of error monitoring.  Clinical assessments of anxiety and irritability were conducted using  questionnaires (i.e., Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders and Affective  Reactivity Index) and clinical interviews. Error monitoring interacted with  early BI and early irritability to predict later psychopathology. Among children  with high BI, an enhanced ERN predicted greater social anxiety at age 12. In  contrast, children with high childhood irritability and blunted ERN predicted  greater irritability at age 12. This converges with previous work and provides  novel insight into the specificity of pathways associated with psychopathology.

Author information: (1)The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.	Endophenotypes are measurable markers of genetic vulnerability to current or  future disorder. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is well-suited to be examined  within an endophenotype framework given past and current emphases on the broader  autism phenotype and early detection. We conducted a scoping review to identify  potential socially-related endophenotypes of ASD. We focused on paradigms  related to sociality (e.g., theory of mind (TOM), social attention), which  comprise most of this literature. We integrated findings from traditional  behavioral paradigms with brain-based measures (e.g., electroencephalography,  functional magnetic resonance imaging). Broadly, infant research regarding  social attention and responsivity (Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domain of  affiliation) and attention to faces and voices (social communication) finds  consistent abnormality in vulnerable infant siblings. Several additional  paradigms that have shown differences in vulnerable infants and young children  include animacy perception tasks (perception and understanding of others),  measures of recognition and response to familiar faces (attachment), and joint  attention and false-belief tasks (understanding mental states). Research areas  such as alexithymia (the perception and understanding of self), empathic  responding, and vocal prosody may hold interest; however, challenges in  measurement across populations and age ranges is a limiting factor. Future work  should address sex differences and age dependencies, specificity to ASD, and  heterogeneous genetic pathways to disorder within samples individuals with ASD  and relatives.

Teenage childbearing (age 15-19 years) represents a significant public health  issue that can generate considerable deleterious, multigenerational consequences  for teen-childbearing mothers and their offspring. However, few studies have  examined the potential mediating mechanisms that may explain if and how teen  childbearing is associated with the development of offspring psychopathology.  The current study used a developmental model to test the mediating role of  chronic child maltreatment in the relationship between teen childbearing and  offspring internalizing symptoms in childhood and emerging adulthood. The study  participants were 384 individuals from socioeconomically disadvantaged,  ethnically diverse backgrounds, assessed across two longitudinal waves of data  (i.e., ages 10-12 and 18-20). The sample included maltreated and nonmaltreated  children, all of whom were comparable in terms of family income. Structural  equation modeling was conducted to test direct and indirect pathways from teen  childbearing to offspring psychopathology. A multigenerational developmental  cascade was found such that individuals born to mothers who began their  childbearing in adolescence were more likely to experience chronic maltreatment  during childhood, which in turn predicted greater internalizing symptoms  throughout childhood and emerging adulthood. Using a developmental  psychopathology framework, the results are discussed with regard to implications  for prevention and early intervention.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is sensitive to early life stress,  with enduring consequences for biological stress vulnerability and health  (Gunnar & Talge, 2008). Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with  dysregulation of the stress hormone cortisol in early childhood. However, a  mechanistic understanding of this association is lacking. Multidimensional  assessment of both SES and cortisol is needed to characterize the intricate  relations between SES and cortisol function in early childhood. We assessed  parent-reported family income, parent education, occupational prestige,  neighborhood risk, food insecurity, and household chaos for 12-month-old infants  (N = 90) and 3.5-year-old children (N = 91). Hair cortisol concentration (HCC)  was obtained from parent and child, indexing chronic biological stress, and  diurnal salivary cortisol was measured in the children. Controlling for parent  HCC, parent education uniquely predicted infant and child HCC and, in addition,  neighborhood risk uniquely predicted infant HCC. Household chaos predicted  bedtime salivary cortisol concentration (SCC) for both infants and children, and  infant daily cortisol output. Food insecurity was associated with flattened  cortisol slope in 3.5-year-old children. Parental sensitivity did not mediate  relations between SES and cortisol. Results highlight the utility of SES  measures that index unpredictable and unsafe contexts, such as neighborhood  risk, food insecurity, and household chaos.

Difficulties with emotion regulation as a transdiagnostic mechanism linking  child maltreatment with the emergence of psychopathology.

(2)Department of Psychology,University of Washington,Seattle,WA,USA. (3)Department of Psychology and Neuroscience,University of North Carolina,Chapel  Hill,NC,USA. (4)Department of Psychology and Neuroscience,Duke University,Durham,NC,USA.	Childhood maltreatment is associated with increased risk for most forms of  psychopathology. We examine emotion dysregulation as a transdiagnostic mechanism  linking maltreatment with general psychopathology. A sample of 262 children and  adolescents participated; 162 (61.8%) experienced abuse or exposure to domestic  violence. We assessed four emotion regulation processes (cognitive reappraisal,  attention bias to threat, expressive suppression, and rumination) and emotional  reactivity. Psychopathology symptoms were assessed concurrently and at a 2-year  longitudinal follow-up. A general psychopathology factor (p factor),  representing co-occurrence of psychopathology symptoms across multiple  internalizing and externalizing domains, was estimated using confirmatory factor  analysis. Maltreatment was associated with heightened emotional reactivity and  greater use of expressive suppression and rumination. The association of  maltreatment with attention bias varied across development, with maltreated  children exhibiting a bias toward threat and adolescents a bias away from  threat. Greater emotional reactivity and engagement in rumination mediated the  longitudinal association between maltreatment and increased general  psychopathology over time. Emotion dysregulation following childhood  maltreatment occurs at multiple stages of the emotion generation process, in  some cases varies across development, and serves as a transdiagnostic mechanism  linking child maltreatment with general psychopathology.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Denver, Denver, CO, USA. (2)Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, University of California,  Irvine, CA, USA.	The pregnancy period represents a unique window of opportunity to identify risks  to both the fetus and mother and to deter the intergenerational transmission of  adversity and mental health problems. Although the maternal-fetal dyad is  especially vulnerable to the effects of stress during pregnancy, less is known  about how the dyad is also receptive to salutary, resilience-promoting  influences. The present review adopts life span and intergenerational  perspectives to review four key areas of research. The first part describes how  pregnancy is a sensitive period for both the mother and fetus. In the second  part, the focus is on antecedents of maternal prenatal risks pertaining to  prenatal stress response systems and mental health. The third part then turns to  elucidating how these alterations in prenatal stress physiology and mental  health problems may affect infant and child outcomes. The fourth part  underscores how pregnancy is also a time of heightened fetal receptivity to  maternal and environmental signals, with profound implications for adaptation.  This section also reviews empirical evidence of promotive and protective factors  that buffer the mother and fetus from developmental and adaptational problems  and covers a sample of rigorous evidence-based prenatal interventions that  prevent maladaptation in the maternal-fetal dyad before babies are born.  Finally, recommendations elaborate on how to further strengthen understanding of  pregnancy as a period of multilevel risk and resilience, enhance comprehensive  prenatal screening, and expand on prenatal interventions to promote  maternal-fetal adaptation before birth.

(2)Department of Psychology, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. (3)Department of Psychology, Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, USA.	Emotion regulation dysfunction is characteristic of psychotic disorders, but  little is known about how the use of specific types of emotion regulation  strategies differs across phases of psychotic illness. This information is vital  for understanding factors contributing to psychosis vulnerability states and  developing targeted treatments. Three studies were conducted to examine emotion  regulation across phases of psychosis, which included (a) adolescent community  members with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs; n = 262) and adolescents without  PLEs (n = 1,226); (b) adolescents who met clinical high-risk criteria for a  prodromal syndrome (n = 29) and healthy controls (n = 29); and (c) outpatients  diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ; n = 61) and  healthy controls (n = 67). In each study, participants completed the Emotion  Regulation Questionnaire and measures of psychiatric symptoms and functional  outcome. The three psychosis groups did not differ from each other in reported  use of suppression; however, there was evidence for a vulnerability-related,  dose-dependent decrease in reappraisal. Across each sample, a lower use of  reappraisal was associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Findings indicate that  emotion regulation abnormalities occur across a continuum of psychosis  vulnerability and represent important targets for intervention.

Transactional relations between developmental trajectories of executive  functioning and internalizing and externalizing symptomatology in adolescence.	Brieant A(1), King-Casas B(2), Kim-Spoon J(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA. (2)Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC, Roanoke, Virginia, USA.	Adolescence is a period of social, physical, and neurobiological transitions  that may leave individuals more vulnerable to the development of internalizing  and externalizing symptomatology. Extant research demonstrates that executive  functioning (EF) is associated with psychopathology outcomes in adolescence;  however, it has yet to be examined how EF and psychopathology develop  transactionally over time. Data were collected from 167 adolescents (47% female,  13-14 years old at Time 1) and their primary caregiver over 4 years. At each  time point, adolescents completed three behavioral tasks that capture the  underlying dimensions of EF, and both adolescents and their primary caregiver  completed measures of adolescent psychopathology. Latent growth curve modeling  was used to test the associations between initial levels and trajectories of EF  and psychopathology. Results indicated that higher initial levels of  internalizing and externalizing symptomatology were associated with lower EF at  Time 4 (controlling for Time 1 EF). Initial levels of EF did not predict changes  in internalizing and externalizing symptomatology. These findings suggest that  early psychopathology may be a risk factor for maladaptive EF development in  adolescence.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001054 PMID: 32955009

This study examined relations among parent adverse childhood experiences (ACEs),  parent mental distress, child social-emotional functioning, and parent emotional  availability (EA) among parents and children served by an Early Head Start  program in an American Indian community. The majority of parents and children in  the study were American Indian/Alaska Native. American Indian/Alaska Native  communities experience relatively high rates of trauma, socioeconomic  disparities, and mental health challenges. In this context, young children may  be especially vulnerable to early life stress. Further, a strong body of  literature demonstrates the long-term effects of ACEs on individuals' mental  health, as well as their child's social-emotional functioning. In this study we  examined a model to test the relation of parent ACEs to children's  social-emotional functioning, with an indirect effect via a latent "mental  distress" variable consisting of parent depression, anxiety, and  parenting-related distress. Results supported this model, suggesting that parent  ACEs related to children's social-emotional problems by way of parent mental  distress. However, when a categorical measure of parent EA was added as a  moderator, the model only remained significant in the low EA parent group. These  results provided evidence for a "buffering" effect of high parent EA on the  relation between parent ACEs, parent mental distress, and children's  social-emotional problems.

Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2019 Oct;31(4):1601.	Growth mixture modeling with a sample of 749 Mexican heritage families  identified parallel trajectories of adolescents' and their mothers' heritage  cultural values and parallel trajectories of adolescents' and their fathers'  heritage cultural values from Grades 5 to 10. Parallel trajectory profiles were  then used to test cultural gap-distress theory that predicts increased  parent-adolescent conflict and adolescent psychopathology over time when  adolescents become less aligned with Mexican heritage values compared to their  parents. Six similar parallel profiles were identified for the mother-youth and  father-youth dyads, but only one of the six was consistent with the hypothesized  problem gap pattern in which adolescents' values were declining over time to  become more discrepant from their parents. When compared to families in the  other trajectory groups as a whole, mothers in the mother-adolescent problem gap  trajectory group reported higher levels of mother-adolescent conflict in the  10th grade that accounted for subsequent increases in internalizing and  externalizing symptoms assessed in 12th grade. Although the findings provided  some support for cultural gap-distress predictions, they were not replicated  with adolescent report of conflict nor with the father-adolescent trajectory  group analyses. Exploratory pairwise comparisons between all six  mother-adolescent trajectory groups revealed additional differences that  qualified and extended these findings.

Conradt E(1), Adkins DE(1), Crowell SE(1), Raby KL(1), Diamond LM(1), Ellis  B(1).	Author information: (1)University of Utah.	Decades of fetal programming research indicates that we may be able to map the  origins of many physical, psychological, and medical variations and morbidities  before the birth of the child. While great strides have been made in identifying  associations between prenatal insults, such as undernutrition or psychosocial  stress, and negative developmental outcomes, far less is known about how  adaptive responses to adversity regulate the developing phenotype to match  stressful conditions. As the application of epigenetic methods to human behavior  has exploded in the last decade, research has begun to shed light on the role of  epigenetic mechanisms in explaining how prenatal conditions shape later  susceptibilities to mental and physical health problems. In this review, we  describe and attempt to integrate two dominant fetal programming models: the  cumulative stress model (a disease-focused approach) and the match-mismatch  model (an evolutionary-developmental approach). In conjunction with biological  sensitivity to context theory, we employ these two models to generate new  hypotheses regarding epigenetic mechanisms through which prenatal and postnatal  experiences program child stress reactivity and, in turn, promote development of  adaptive versus maladaptive phenotypic outcomes. We conclude by outlining  priority questions and future directions for the fetal programming field.

Author information: (1)Harvard University and Universidad de San Buenaventura,Medellín.	The literature on developmental psychopathology has been criticized for its  limited integration of culture and, particularly, the lack of research  addressing cultural development in relation to psychopathology. In this paper, I  present how the study of ethnic-racial identity provides a heuristic model for  how culture can be examined developmentally and in relation to psychopathology.  In addition, I introduce the Identity Project intervention program and discuss  how its findings provide empirical support for the notions that cultural  development can be modified with intervention, and that such modifications can  lead to psychosocial benefits for adolescents. Finally, I discuss existing  challenges to advancing this work and important future directions for both basic  and translational research in this area.

Existing research has suggested children of caregivers with histories of  exposure to trauma are at heightened risk for victimization, but few studies  have explored potential mechanisms that explain this intergenerational  transmission of risk. With data from peri-urban households in Lima, Peru (N =  402), this study analyzes parenting behaviors in the relation between  caregivers' trauma history and child victimization for children aged 4-17.  Results indicated caregivers' trauma history and negative parenting behaviors  related to child victimization, and negative parenting behaviors mediated this  relation. Positive parenting behaviors did not have significant direct effects  and were not mediators of risk transmission. Parenting behaviors did not  moderate the relation between caregiver and child victimization, suggesting  parenting behaviors may not buffer or exacerbate intergenerational transmission.  Post-hoc analyses revealed family type (e.g., single, cohabitating/married)  exerted significant direct and moderating effects on child risk, interacting  with positive parenting. Families with married/cohabitating caregivers reported  overall lower levels of child victimization; however, the relation between  positive parenting and victimization was slightly stronger for children in  single-parent families. Results highlight potential pathways of the  intergenerational cycle of victimization and suggest high-risk families in Peru  may benefit from parenting supports, especially pertaining to remediation of  negative parenting behaviors.

Author information: (1)Institute of Education and Child Studies, Leiden University, Leiden, The  Netherlands.	Foster and adoptive parents often face challenges while taking care of children  who, due to their adverse early life experiences, are at risk of developing  insecure attachment relationships, behavior problems, and stress dysregulation.  Several intervention programs have been developed to help foster and adoptive  parents to overcome these challenges. In the current study, a series of eight  meta-analyses were performed to examine the effectiveness of these intervention  programs on four parent outcomes (sensitive parenting, k = 11, N = 684;  dysfunctional discipline, k = 4, N = 239; parenting knowledge and attitudes, k =  7, N = 535; parenting stress, k = 18, N = 1,306), three child outcomes  (attachment security, k = 6, N = 395; behavior problems, k = 33, N = 2,661;  diurnal cortisol levels, k = 3, N = 261), and placement disruption (k = 7, N =  1,100). Results show positive effects for the four parent outcomes and child  behavior problems, but not for attachment security, child diurnal cortisol  levels, or placement disruption. Indirect effects on child outcomes may be  delayed, and therefore long-term follow-up studies are needed to examine the  effects of parenting interventions on children.

Social withdrawal and social anxiety are believed to have a bidirectional  influence on one another, but it is unknown if their relationship is  bidirectional, especially within person, and if peer experiences influence this  relationship. We investigated temporal sequencing and the strength of effects  between social withdrawal and social anxiety, and the roles of peer  victimization and acceptance in the pathways. Participants were 2,772  adolescents from the population-based and clinically referred cohorts of the  Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey. Self- and parent-reported  withdrawal, and self-reported social anxiety, peer victimization, and perceived  peer acceptance were assessed at 11, 13, and 16 years. Random-intercept  cross-lagged panel models were used to investigate within-person associations  between these variables. There was no feedback loop between withdrawal and  social anxiety. Social withdrawal did not predict social anxiety at any age.  Social anxiety at 11 years predicted increased self-reported withdrawal at 13  years. Negative peer experiences predicted increased self- and parent-reported  withdrawal at 13 years and increased parent-reported withdrawal at 16 years. In  turn, self-reported withdrawal at 13 years predicted negative peer experiences  at 16 years. In conclusion, adolescents became more withdrawn when they became  more socially anxious or experienced greater peer problems, and increasing  withdrawal predicted greater victimization and lower acceptance.

Early maturation in girls  is linked to risk for depression and externalizing problems in adolescence and  possibly adulthood, and early and late maturation in boys are linked to  depression. It is unclear whether pubertal timing uniquely predicts problems; it  might instead mediate the continuity of behavior problems from childhood to  adolescence or create psychological risk specifically in youth with existing  problems, thus moderating the link. We investigated these issues in 534 girls  and 550 boys, measuring pubertal timing by a logistic model fit to annual  self-report measures of development and, in girls, age at menarche. Prepuberty  internalizing and externalizing behavior problems were reported by parents.  Adolescent behavior problems were reported by parents and youth. As expected,  behavior problems were moderately stable. Pubertal timing was not predicted by  childhood problems, so it did not mediate the continuity of behavior problems  from childhood to adolescence. Pubertal timing did not moderate links between  early and later problems for girls. For boys, early maturation accentuated the  link between childhood problems and adolescent substance use. Overall, the  replicated links between puberty and behavior problems appear to reflect the  unique effects of puberty and child behavior problems on the development of  adolescent behavior problems.

Addressing educational inequalities and promoting learning through studies of  stress physiology in elementary school students.	Obradović J(1), Armstrong-Carter E(1).	Author information: (1)Graduate School of Education, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.	To be ready to learn, children need to be focused, engaged, and able to bounce  back from setbacks. However, many children come to school with heightened or  diminished physiological arousal due to exposure to poverty-related risks. While  stress physiology plays a role in explaining how adversity relates to processes  that support students' cognitive development, there is a lack of studies of  physiological stress response in educational settings. This review integrates  relevant studies and offers future directions for research on the role of stress  physiology in the school adaptation of elementary school students, focusing on  these important questions: (a) What are the links between physiological stress  response and learning-related skills and behaviors, and do they vary as a  function of proximal and distal experiences outside of school? (b) How are  school experiences associated with students' physiological stress response and  related cognitive and behavioral adaptations? (c) How can we leverage measures  of students' physiological stress response in evaluations of school-based  interventions to better support the school success of every student? We hope to  stimulate a new wave of research that will advance the science of developmental  stress physiology, as well as improve the application of these findings in  educational policy and practice.

One way in which maltreatment may exert its deleterious effects is by  becoming embedded in the activity of neurophysiological systems that regulate  metabolic function. This paper reviews the literature regarding the association  between childhood maltreatment and the activity of three systems: the  parasympathetic nervous system, the sympathetic nervous system, and the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. A particular emphasis is placed on the  extent to which the literature supports a common account of activity across  these systems under conditions of homeostasis and stress. The paper concludes  with an outline of directions for future research and the implications of the  literature for policy and practice.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000383 PMID: 32624073

(4)Department of Psychology, Chapman University, Orange, CA, USA.	Associations between prenatal maternal psychological distress and offspring  developmental outcomes are well documented, yet relatively little research has  examined links between maternal distress and development in utero, prior to  postpartum influences. Fetal heart rate (FHR) parameters are established indices  of central and autonomic nervous system maturation and function which  demonstrate continuity with postnatal outcomes. This prospective, longitudinal  study of 149 maternal-fetal pairs evaluated associations between prenatal  maternal distress, FHR parameters, and dimensions of infant temperament. Women  reported their symptoms of psychological distress at five prenatal visits, and  FHR monitoring was conducted at the last three visits. Maternal report of infant  temperament was collected at 3 and 6 months of age. Exposure to elevated  prenatal maternal psychological distress was associated with higher  late-gestation resting mean FHR (FHRM) among female but not male fetuses. Higher  late-gestation FHRM was associated with lower infant orienting/regulation and  with higher infant negative affectivity, and these associations did not differ  by infant sex. A path analysis identified higher FHRM as one pathway by which  elevated prenatal maternal distress was associated with lower  orienting/regulation among female infants. Findings suggest that, for females,  elevated maternal distress alters fetal development, with implications for  postnatal function. Results also support the notion that, for both sexes,  individual differences in regulation emerge prenatally and are maintained into  infancy. Collectively, these findings underscore the utility of direct  assessment of development in utero when examining if prenatal experiences are  carried forward into postnatal life.

Author information: (1)Departments of Psychology and Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin,  Madison, WI, USA. (2)Departments of Economics, Population Health Sciences and Public Affairs,  University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.	Nearly 1 in 5 children in the United States lives in a household whose income is  below the official federal poverty line, and more than 40% of children live in  poor or near-poor households. Research on the effects of poverty on children's  development has been a focus of study for many decades and is now increasing as  we accumulate more evidence about the implications of poverty. The American  Academy of Pediatrics recently added "Poverty and Child Health" to its Agenda  for Children to recognize what has now been established as broad and enduring  effects of poverty on child development. A recent addition to the field has been  the application of neuroscience-based methods. Various techniques including  neuroimaging, neuroendocrinology, cognitive psychophysiology, and epigenetics  are beginning to document ways in which early experiences of living in poverty  affect infant brain development. We discuss whether there are truly worthwhile  reasons for adding neuroscience and related biological methods to study child  poverty, and how might these perspectives help guide developmentally based and  targeted interventions and policies for these children and their families.

Craig SG(1), Moretti MM(1).	Author information: (1)Simon Fraser University,Burnaby, British Columbia.	There is increasing evidence for multiple pathways in the development of  callous-unemotional (CU) features, including primary and secondary profiles.  Understanding affect regulation strategies among variants may provide further  insight to the development and treatment of CU features. This study evaluated  whether profiles of CU features could be identified within a clinical sample of  youth using measures of affect dysregulation, affect suppression, anxiety, and  maltreatment. We also examined whether these profiles were consistent across  gender. Participants (N = 418; 56.7% female) ranged in age from 12 to 19 years  (M = 15.04, SD = 1.85) and were drawn from a clinical sample. Latent profile  analysis (LPA) was conducted using five indicators, including affect regulation,  suppression, anxiety, CU features, and maltreatment. The best fitting model, a  four-profile solution, included a low (low CU/dysregulation), anxious (low  CU/high dysregulation), primary CU (high CU/low dysregulation), and secondary CU  profile (high CU/dysregulation/maltreatment). LPAs found the same four-profile  model when conducted separately for males and females. This is the first study  to examine gender and include affect regulation strategies in the examination of  primary and secondary profiles of CU.

Alcohol and other substance use problems are common, and the efficacy of current  prevention and intervention programs is limited. Genetics may contribute to  differential effectiveness of psychosocial prevention and intervention programs.  This paper reviews gene-by-intervention (G×I) studies of alcohol and other  substance use, and implications for integrating genetics into prevention  science. Systematic review yielded 17 studies for inclusion. Most studies  focused on youth substance prevention, alcohol was the most common outcome, and  measures of genotype were heterogeneous. All studies reported at least one  significant G×I interaction. We discuss these findings in the context of the  history and current state of genetics, and provide recommendations for future  G×I research. These include the integration of genome-wide polygenic scores into  prevention studies, broad outcome measurement, recruitment of underrepresented  populations, testing mediators of G×I effects, and addressing ethical  implications. Integrating genetic research into prevention science, and training  researchers to work fluidly across these fields, will enhance our ability to  determine the best intervention for each individual across development. With  growing public interest in obtaining personalized genetic information, we  anticipate that the integration of genetics and prevention science will become  increasingly important as we move into the era of precision medicine.

(2)Department of Psychology,University of Minnesota,Minneapolis,MN, USA.	Previous research has shown that problematic parent-child, peer, and romantic  partner relationships are associated with an increased likelihood for major  depressive disorder (MDD). Less research has evaluated the developmental  unfolding of how these interpersonal relationship features are both an  antecedent versus a consequence of MDD symptoms from adolescence through young  adulthood. These gaps were evaluated using a large community sample (N = 1,127;  54% female, 96% white) via a developmental cascade model. Results showed support  for significant antecedent effects, as greater parent-child relationship  problems at ages 11 and 17 predicted rank-order increases in MDD symptoms at  ages 14 and 20. Supporting a developmental cascade of problematic social  relationships, greater parent-child relationship problems at ages 11 and 14 also  predicted greater subsequent rank-order increases in antisocial peer affiliation  at ages 14 and 17. Greater affiliation to antisocial peers at age 20 predicted  greater rank-order increases in romantic relationship problems at age 24, which  in turn predicted greater MDD symptoms at age 29. Cross-effects were generally  small (βs ≤ .16), illustrating other factors may be relevant to the development  or consequences of MDD. Nonetheless, findings support the importance of efforts  to strengthen social support networks to offset risk as well as potentially  treat depression.

Advancing the assessment of cultural orientation: A developmental and contextual  framework of multiple psychological dimensions and social identities.	Knight GP(1), Safa MD(1), White RMB(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University.	This paper aims to advance the scientific understanding of the role of culture,  particularly cultural orientation, in development and psychopathology. We  advance a theoretical framework that conceptualizes cultural orientation as a  developmental construct represented by multiple psychological dimensions and  social identities, and influenced by the contexts in which individuals are  embedded. This perspective suggests that cultural orientation changes within  individuals over time as a function of their experiences with and memberships in  multiple groups, including the mainstream and ethnic culture groups, as well as  a function of their normative developmental changes (i.e., the development of  cognitive, social, and emotional capabilities). In addition, this framework  places the development of an ethnic culture social identity (e.g., an ethnic  identity) and a mainstream culture social identity in broader developmental  perspectives that recognize these as two of the many social identities that are  simultaneously embedded within the individual's self-concept and that  simultaneously influence one's cultural orientation. To support the successful  integration of culture into the study of development and psychopathology, we  describe how highly reliable and valid measures of cultural orientation, indexed  by individuals' social identities, are essential for generating a scientifically  credible understanding of the role of cultural orientation in development and  psychopathology. Further, we detail some best research practices associated with  our developmental and contextual framework, and note some important  considerations for researchers interested in studying cultural orientation,  development, and psychopathology.

(2)Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, The Johns Hopkins  University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.	Infant siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit greater  heterogeneity in behavioral presentation and outcomes relative to infants at low  familial risk (LR), yet there is limited understanding of the diverse  developmental profiles that characterize these infants. We applied a  hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis approach to parse developmental  heterogeneity in 420 toddlers with heightened (HR) and low (LR) familial risk  for ASD using measures of four dimensions of development: language, social,  play, and restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB). Results revealed a  two-cluster solution. Comparisons of clusters revealed significantly lower  language, social, and play performance, and higher levels of restricted and  repetitive behaviors in Cluster 1 relative to Cluster 2. In Cluster 1, 25% of  children were later diagnosed with ASD compared to 8% in Cluster 2. Comparisons  within Cluster 1 between subgroups of toddlers having ASD+ versus ASD- 36-month  outcomes revealed significantly lower functioning in the ASD+ subgroup across  cognitive, motor, social, language, symbolic, and speech dimensions. Findings  suggest profiles of early development associated with resiliency and  vulnerability to later ASD diagnosis, with multidimensional developmental lags  signaling vulnerability to ASD diagnosis.

Chronic illness in childhood and early adolescence: A longitudinal exploration  of co-occurring mental illness.	Brady AM(1), Deighton J(2), Stansfeld S(1).	Author information: (1)Centre for Psychiatry, Bart's and the London School of Medicine and  Dentistry, London, UK. (2)Evidence Based Practice Unit, Anna Freud Centre, University College London,  London, UK.	Chronic health conditions are hypothesized to disrupt the typical trajectory of  child and adolescent development, and subsequently lead to increased levels of  mental illness. However, due to methodological limitations in existing studies,  this theory remains to be fully substantiated by empirical research. This study  aimed to more thoroughly test hypotheses in the field. This study used data from  the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to examine the co-occurrence  of mental illness among children with chronic illness in late childhood into  early adolescence and explore mediating factors in these outcomes. Children with  chronic health problems presented with a disproportionate rate of psychiatric  illness at 10 years, and these chronic health problems continued to be  associated with poor mental health outcomes at 13 years and 15 years. These  outcomes were mediated by high levels of peer victimization and health-related  school absenteeism. This study suggests that chronic illness may impact on  functioning and social development in early adolescence, and consequently lead  to increased rates of mental illness. Examining rates of school absenteeism and  peer victimization may be key to identifying children at risk over time.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000206 PMID: 32362290

Early life adversity (ELA) has been associated with inflammation and  immunosenescence, as well as hyporeactivity of the HPA axis. Because the immune  system and the HPA axis are tightly intertwined around the glucocorticoid  receptor (GR), we examined peripheral GR functionality in the EpiPath cohort  among participants who either had been exposed to ELA (separation from parents  and/or institutionalization followed by adoption; n = 40) or had been reared by  their biological parents (n = 72).Expression of the strict GR target genes FKBP5  and GILZ as well as total and 1F and 1H GR transcripts were similar between  groups. Furthermore, there were no differences in GR sensitivity, examined by  the effects of dexamethasone on IL6 production in LPS-stimulated whole blood.  Although we did not find differences in methylation at the GR 1F exon or  promoter region, we identified a region of the GR 1H promoter (CpG 1-9) that  showed lower methylation levels in ELA.Our results suggest that peripheral GR  signaling was unperturbed in our cohort and the observed immune phenotype does  not appear to be secondary to an altered GR response to the perturbed HPA axis  and glucocorticoid (GC) profile, although we are limited in our measures of GR  activity and time points.

Trajectories of mother-child and father-child relationships across middle  childhood and associations with depressive symptoms.	Yan J(1), Schoppe-Sullivan SJ(1), Feng X(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Human Sciences,Ohio State University,Columbus,OH,USA.	Using a family systems perspective, we examined the trajectories of father-child  and mother-child closeness and conflict across Grades 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and  their associations with child depressive symptoms across middle childhood among  685 families in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health  and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD).  Father-child and mother-child relationship conflict increased, whereas  relationship closeness decreased from Grades 1 to 6. Girls with more slowly  increasing father-child conflict, and more slowly decreasing father-child  closeness, were at lower risk for depressive symptoms. Boys with more slowly  increasing mother-child conflict were at lower risk for depressive symptoms.  These findings highlight the important roles of both father-child and  mother-child relationships in children's emotional adjustment during middle  childhood.

(2)Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University,  Hamilton, ON, Canada.	This study explores the conceptualization of mother-infant cortisol attunement  both theoretically and empirically, and its association with mother-infant  attachment disorganization. In a community sample (N = 256), disorganization and  cortisol were assessed during the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) at infant  age 17 months. Salivary cortisol was collected at baseline, and 20 and 40 min  after the SSP. We utilized three statistical approaches: correlated growth  modeling (probing a simultaneous conceptualization of attunement), cross-lagged  modeling (probing a lagged, reciprocal conceptualization of attunement), and a  multilevel model difference score analysis (to examine the pattern of  discrepancies in mother-infant cortisol values). Correlated growth modeling  revealed that disorganized, relative to organized, dyads had significant  magnitude of change over time, such that, among disorganized dyads, as mothers  had greater declines in cortisol, infants had greater increases. The difference  score analysis revealed that disorganized, relative to organized, dyads had a  greater divergence between maternal and infant cortisol values, such that  maternal values were lower than infant values. Disorganized attachment status  was not significantly associated with attunement when conceptualized as  reciprocal and lagged in the cross-lagged model. Findings suggest that  mother-infant dyads in disorganized attachment relationships, who are by  definition behaviorally misattuned, are also misattuned in their adrenocortical  responses.

Author information: (1)Istanbul Sehir University.	Following the civil war in Syria, there has been a growing interest in the  impact of war, violent conflict, and refuge on the development and mental health  of refugee children in general and Syrian refugee children in particular. The  objective of this paper is threefold: (a) to critically review the existing  literature on the psychological functioning of Syrian refugee children, with a  particular focus on those residing in the urban areas or camps in Turkey; (b) to  identify the main theoretical and methodological problems of this emerging  literature; and (c) to suggest guidelines for how to improve research and  practice in this field. The reviewed literature predominantly focuses on  psychological trauma, trauma-related symptomatology or other maladaptive  functioning in children, and psychosocial interventions conducted toward  alleviating these issues. This paper will summarize the research findings in the  above-mentioned topics to discern what can be known from the existing literature  on Syrian refugee children.

Maternal and paternal trajectories of depressive symptoms predict family risk  and children's emotional and behavioral problems after the birth of a sibling.	Volling BL(1), Yu T(2), Gonzalez R(1), Tengelitsch E(3), Stevenson MM(1).	Author information: (1)Center for Human Growth and Development, University of Michigan,Ann Arbor,  MI,USA. (2)Center for Family Research, University of Georgia,Athens, GA,USA. (3)Department of Psychiatry,University of Michigan,Ann Arbor, MI,USA.	The current study examined trajectories of maternal and paternal depression in  the year following the birth of an infant sibling, and relations with family  risk factors and firstborn children's internalizing and externalizing behavior  problems. Latent class growth analysis was conducted on 231 families in a  longitudinal investigation (prebirth and 1, 4, 8, and 12 months postbirth) and  revealed four classes of families: both mother and father low in depressive  symptoms (40.7%); mother high-father low (25.1%); father high-mother low  (24.7%), and both mother and father high (9.5%). Families with both mothers and  fathers high on depressive symptoms were higher on marital negativity, parenting  stress, and children's internalizing and externalizing problems, and lower on  marital positivity and parental efficacy than other classes. Children, parents,  and marital relationships were more problematic in families with fathers higher  on depressive symptoms than in families in which mothers were higher, indicating  the significant role of paternal support for firstborn children undergoing the  transition to siblinghood. Maternal and paternal depression covaried with an  accumulation of family risks over time, no doubt increasing the likelihood of  children's problematic adjustment after the birth of their infant sibling.

Temperamental vulnerability to emotion dysregulation and risk for mental and  physical health challenges.	Calkins SD(1), Dollar JM(1), Wideman L(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Human Development and Family Studies,University of North  Carolina at Greensboro,Greensboro, NC,USA. (2)Department of Kinesiology,University of North Carolina at  Greensboro,Greensboro, NC,USA.	Emotion dysregulation characterizes many forms of psychopathology. Patterns of  dysregulation occur as a function of a developmental process in which normative  and adaptive emotion regulation skills fail to become part of the child's  behavioral repertoire due to biological, psychological, and contextual processes  and experiences. Here we highlight the processes involved in the dysregulation  of temperamental anger and frustration that become core features of  externalizing problems and place children at risk for more serious forms of  psychopathology. We imbed these processes in a larger self-regulatory framework,  and we discuss how they influence mental as well as physical health, using data  from our 20-year longitudinal study following a large cohort of children into  young adulthood. Recommendations are made for future research involving the  integration of biological systems with mental and physical health outcomes.

Chen L(1), Chen X(1).	Author information: (1)Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA,  USA.	The purpose of the present study was to examine the role of depressive peer  group context in individual social and school adjustment in a sample of 1,430  Chinese adolescents (672 boys, mean age = 15.43 years) from middle (n = 430) and  high (n = 1000) schools. Peer groups were identified using the Social Cognitive  Map technique. One-year longitudinal data on depression and social and school  adjustment were obtained from self-reports, peer nominations, teacher ratings,  and school records. Multilevel analyses showed that group-level depression  positively predicted later individual depression. Moreover, group-level  depression negatively predicted later social competence, peer preference, school  competence, and academic achievement, and it positively predicted later peer  victimization and learning problems. The results suggest that affiliation with  more depressive peer groups contributes to more psychological, social, and  school adjustment problems in a cascading manner among Chinese adolescents.

A low resting heart rate across development from infancy to young adulthood  relates to greater aggression/hostility. Adult aggression and a high heart rate  relate to health risk. Do some aggressive individuals retain low heart rate and  less health risk across development while others show high heart rate and more  risk? A longitudinal sample of 203 men assessed as teens (age 16.1) and adults  (mean age 32.0) permitted us to assess (a) stability of heart rate levels and  reactivity, (b) stability of aggression/hostility, and (c) whether change or  stability related to health risk. Adults were assessed with Buss-Perry measures  of aggression/hostility; teens with the Zuckerman aggression/hostility measure.  Mean resting heart rate, heart rate reactivity to speech preparation, and  aggression/hostility were moderately stable across development. Within age  periods, mean heart rate level, but not reactivity, was negatively related to  hostility/aggression. Maintaining low heart rate into adulthood was related to  better health among aggressive individuals relative to those with increasing  heart rate into adulthood. Analyses controlled for weight gain, socioeconomic  status, race, health habits, and medication. Low heart rate as a characteristic  of hostile/aggressive individuals may continue to relate to better health  indices in adulthood, despite possible reversal of this relationship with aging.

McCauley JB(1), Elias R(1), Lord C(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.	Given high rates of co-occurring conditions in youth and adults with autism  spectrum disorder (ASD), it is critical to examine the developmental  trajectories of these symptoms of psychopathology. Using data from a cohort of  participants (n = 194), most of whom were first assessed for ASD in very early  childhood, we investigated the trajectories of co-occurring depressive, anxiety,  and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms from late childhood  to adulthood. Additionally, childhood predictors and adult outcomes associated  with these symptom trajectories were examined. Using group-based trajectory  modeling, we found two distinct classes of individuals exhibiting each of these  co-occurring symptom patterns: one class exhibited fairly low symptoms across  time, and one class with elevated symptoms with varied fluctuation across time  (ADHD symptoms starting high but decreasing, anxiety symptoms high and stable,  and depressive symptoms fluctuating but peaking at clinically significant levels  in young adulthood). All high trajectory classes were associated with age 9  adaptive skills; verbal IQ predicted higher anxiety and depressive symptom  classes. After accounting for verbal IQ, all high symptom trajectory classes  were negative predictors of objective adult outcomes. These findings call for  wide-ranging considerations of the needs of individuals across ability levels,  autism symptoms, and behavioral and emotional challenges.

Early life stress (ELS) is a risk factor for the development of depression in  adolescence; the mediating neurobiological mechanisms, however, are unknown. In  this study, we examined in early pubertal youth the associations among ELS,  cortisol stress responsivity, and white matter microstructure of the uncinate  fasciculus and the fornix, two key frontolimbic tracts; we also tested whether  and how these variables predicted depressive symptoms in later puberty. A total  of 208 participants (117 females; M age = 11.37 years; M Tanner stage = 2.03)  provided data across two or more assessment modalities: ELS; salivary cortisol  levels during a psychosocial stress task; diffusion magnetic resonance imaging;  and depressive symptoms. In early puberty there were significant associations  between higher ELS and decreased cortisol production, and between decreased  cortisol production and increased fractional anisotropy in the uncinate  fasciculus. Further, increased fractional anisotropy in the uncinate fasciculus  predicted higher depressive symptoms in later puberty, above and beyond earlier  symptoms. In post hoc analyses, we found that sex moderated several additional  associations. We discuss these findings within a broader conceptual model  linking ELS, emotion dysregulation, and depression across the transition through  puberty, and contend that brain circuits implicated in the control of  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function should be a focus of continued  research.

Exposure to child maltreatment increases the risk for psychiatric and physical  diseases. Inflammation has been proposed as a mechanism through which early  adverse experiences become biologically embedded. However, most studies  providing evidence for the link between early adverse exposures and inflammation  have been retrospective or cross-sectional in design, or did not assess  inflammation immediately after maltreatment in young children. In the present  study we investigated the association between childhood maltreatment and  salivary C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in a population of N = 173  children, 3-5 years of age, who were recruited in the immediate aftermath of  maltreatment and followed-up longitudinally every 6 months over a period of 2  years. We found that the association between maltreatment and CRP concentrations  was significantly moderated by child sex, such that in girls, CRP concentrations  were higher in the maltreated compared to the control group, and this difference  was stable across the 2-year follow-up-period, while in boys, there was no  association between maltreatment and CRP. Our findings suggest that the effect  of maltreatment on inflammation may already emerge right after exposure at a  very young age in girls and manifest over time. Our study provides important  evidence for the development of personalized, early interventions strategies  targeting the early-life period.

This study used data from 12 cultural groups in 9 countries (China, Colombia,  Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and United States; N =  1,315) to investigate bidirectional associations between parental warmth and  control, and child externalizing and internalizing behaviors. In addition, the  extent to which these associations held across mothers and fathers and across  cultures with differing normative levels of parent warmth and control were  examined. Mothers, fathers, and children completed measures when children were  ages 8 to 13. Multiple-group autoregressive cross-lagged structural equation  models revealed that evocative child-driven effects of externalizing and  internalizing behavior on warmth and control are ubiquitous across development,  cultures, mothers, and fathers. Results also reveal that parenting effects on  child externalizing and internalizing behaviors, though rarer than child  effects, extend into adolescence when examined separately in mothers and  fathers. Father-based parent effects were more frequent than mother effects.  Most parent- and child-driven effects appear to emerge consistently across  cultures. The rare culture-specific parenting effects suggested that  occasionally the effects of parenting behaviors that run counter to cultural  norms may be delayed in rendering their protective effect against deleterious  child outcomes.

Self-directed speech and self-regulation in childhood neurodevelopmental  disorders: Current findings and future directions.	Mulvihill A(1), Carroll A(1), Dux PE(2), Matthews N(2).	Author information: (1)School of Education, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. (2)School of Psychology, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.	Self-directed speech is considered an important developmental achievement as a  self-regulatory mediator of thinking and behavior. Atypical self-directed speech  is often implicated in the self-regulatory challenges characteristic of children  with neurodevelopmental disorders. A growing body of evidence provides snapshots  across age-levels and diagnoses, often presenting conflicting results. This  systematic review is undertaken to impose clarity on the nature, extent, and  self-regulatory implications of self-directed speech interruption in children  with developmental language disorder (DLD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).A rigorous search process of  relevant databases (i.e., PsychInfo, PubMed, CINAHL, ERIC) uncovered 19 relevant  peer-reviewed articles that investigate self-directed speech in children with  neurodevelopmental disorders. Consistent across the research, children with DLD,  ASD, and ADHD present with differential development and use of self-directed  speech.In its synthesis of findings, this systematic review clearly explicates  the differential ontogenesis of self-directed speech in neurodevelopmental  disorders and interprets the self-regulatory implications for children with DLD,  ASD, and ADHD. Furthermore, the review spotlights important future research  directions to better understand the mechanistic relationship between  self-directed speech and self-regulation.

Parents' comparisons of siblings have been understudied among sibling research,  especially in Chinese societies where the government recently relaxed its  one-child policy. This study, using a two-wave longitudinal design, explored how  parents' comparisons of siblings were associated with adolescents' internalizing  and externalizing problems. Study participants were 260 Chinese adolescents who  had siblings and completed questionnaires that assessed their internalizing and  externalizing problems, as well as their perceptions of parents' critical  comparisons of siblings. Cross-lagged modeling analysis showed that parents'  comparisons of siblings predicted more internalizing and externalizing problems  in adolescents 6 months later. Moreover, adolescents' externalizing problems but  not internalizing problems predicted more parents' comparisons of siblings over  time. These findings underscore the importance of reciprocal relations between  parents' comparisons of siblings and adolescents' externalizing problems and the  implication of cultural context in understanding associations between parental  practices and adolescents' adjustment.

Author information: (1)Department of Human Development, College of Human Ecology, Cornell  University, Ithaca, NY, USA.	I present a theory of adaptive intelligence and discuss why I believe adaptive  intelligence, rather than general intelligence, is the kind of intelligence upon  which we should focus in today's world. Adaptive intelligence is the ability to  adapt to, shape, and select real-world environments in ways that result in  positive outcomes not only for oneself, but also for others and the world.  Edward Zigler was among the first to recognize the importance of levels of  adaptation to intellectual deficiency, arguing from early on that intellectual  challenges needed to be recognized not just in terms of IQ but also in terms of  adaptive functioning. Adaptive intelligence is compared to and contrasted with  general intelligence, which is usually defined as the first factor in a factor  analysis of psychometric tests. I first introduce the main issues in the  article. Then I discuss how one even would decide what intelligence is. Next I  discuss broader theories of intelligence and especially the theory of adaptive  intelligence. Then I talk about the perishability of theories of intelligence  and other things-to what extent are they set up so that people are willing and  able to move beyond them? Finally, I discuss how individual outcomes do not  necessarily predict collective outcomes.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000693 PMID: 32967756

Author information: (1)University of Otago. (2)York University. (3)Durham University. (4)Liverpool University.	Maternal elaborative reminiscing supports preschool children's autobiographical  memory, self-concept, and emotion understanding. What are the factors  contributing to mothers' elaborative style of reminiscing? In a longitudinal  community sample (n = 170 at the final data point), this study explored the role  of maternal depression (8-44 months), maternal sensitivity and maternal  mind-mindedness (8 months), as well as child factors of joint attention (15  months), attachment security (15 months), and language (26 months) for  mother-child reminiscing about a positive (happy) and a negative (scared) event  at 44 months. Mothers could be classed into two groups of low versus increasing  depression from 8 to 44 months, yet maternal depression did not uniquely predict  mother-child reminiscing after accounting for maternal sensitivity and other  factors. Instead, maternal sensitivity, children's joint attention, and language  uniquely predicted children's elaborations about the scared event at 44 months,  and maternal sensitivity uniquely predicted mothers' elaborations about the  scared event at 44 months. Mothers who are more sensitive in early interactions  may later be better at engaging their children when reminiscing about negative  emotions. These findings have implications for the design of interventions  targeted at supporting mothers to engage in elaborative reminiscing with their  preschool children.

Waters, Ruiz, and Roisman (2017) recently published evidence based on the  Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation (MLSRA) that sensitive  caregiving during childhood is associated with higher levels of secure base  script knowledge during the Adult Attachment Interview (AAIsbs). At present,  however, little is known about the role of variation in atypical caregiving,  including abuse and/or neglect, in explaining individual differences in AAIsbs.  This study revisited data from the MLSRA (N = 157) to examine the association  between experiencing abuse and/or neglect in the first 17.5 years of life and  secure base script knowledge measured at ages 19 and 26 years. Several aspects  of abuse and/or neglect experiences were assessed, including perpetrator  identity, timing, and type. Regressions revealed that childhood abuse and/or  neglect was robustly associated with lower AAIsbs scores in young adulthood,  above and beyond previously documented associations with maternal sensitivity  and demographic covariates. Follow-up analyses provided evidence that the  predictive significance of abuse for secure base script knowledge was specific  to perpetration by parental figures, rather than non-caregivers. Exploratory  analyses indicated that abuse and/or neglect: (a) in middle childhood and  adolescence (but not infancy and early childhood) and (b) physical abuse (but  not sexual abuse or neglect) were uniquely associated with lower AAIsbs scores.

Tiberio SS(1), Capaldi DM(1).	Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center, Eugene, OR, USA.	Whether men's and women's reciprocation of their intimate partners' negative and  positive affect during conflictual topic discussions accounted for the  association between their trait hostility and perpetration of physical intimate  partner violence (IPV) was examined within a dyadic model, using concurrent  measurement. The work builds on that of Dr. Tom Dishion regarding hostile and  coercive interactions in key relationships on risk outcomes and the importance  of moment-by-moment influences in social interactions. Using dynamic development  systems theory and a community sample of at-risk men (N = 156) and their female  partners, the hypothesis that quicker negative and slower positive affect  reactivity would account for physical IPV perpetration beyond trait hostility  was tested. Results suggest that, for women, quicker negative affect reactivity  partially explains the hostility IPV association, whereas for men, trait  hostility of both partners best explained their perpetration of physical IPV. No  support was found for positive affect reactivity as a protective relationship  process for IPV involvement. Findings are in line with other studies indicating  men were less likely to engage in negative reciprocity relative to women.  Furthermore, findings highlight how both partners' individual characteristics,  communication patterns, and emotion regulation processes germane to the romantic  relationship impact the likelihood of experiencing physical IPV.

Generalist genes and specialist environments for adolescent internalizing and  externalizing problems: A test of severity and directionality.	Marceau K(1)(2), Neiderhiser J(1)(2).	Author information: (1)Human Development and Family Studies, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN,  USA. (2)Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park,  PA, USA.	The generalist genes specialist environment model, when applied to developmental  psychopathology, predicts that genetic influences should explain variance that  is shared across internalizing and externalizing problems, whereas environmental  influences should explain variance that distinguishes the two overarching  problem types. The present study is a direct test of this hypothesis, leveraging  a sample of 708 twins and siblings (aged 10-18 years, 93% White) from the United  States. Measures of severity of symptoms, regardless of type, and of  directionality of symptoms - whether the adolescent tended to exhibit more  externalizing or internalizing problems - were subjected to genetic (A), shared  environmental (C), and nonshared environmental (E) (ACE) variance  decompositions. As expected, severity of problems was under substantial genetic  influence, but there were also significant shared and nonshared environmental  influences. Contrary to the generalist genes specialist environment model,  directionality of problem type was also under considerable genetic influence,  with modest nonshared environmental influence. Findings corroborate existing  evidence from other designs highlighting the role of familial influences  (including generalist genes) in comorbidity of adolescent internalizing and  externalizing problems, but suggest that the specialist environments hypothesis  may not be the key factor in distinguishing problem type.

The current study examined the effects of attachment on autonomy, relatedness,  and emotion regulation during an attachment interview (Friends and Family  Interview; FFI) and a Parent×Child Conflict interaction (Family Interaction  Task; FIT) in 49 adolescents (11 to 17 years old). Disorganized adolescents  displayed behaviors promoting autonomy and relatedness less frequently and at a  lower extent than organized ones in the FIT with mothers but not with fathers.  Disorganized adolescents also showed a steeper decrease in heart rate  variability (HRV) than organized ones, during both the FFI and the FITs.  Moreover, disorganized adolescents responded with a more marked increase in skin  conductance level to the FIT with mothers than organized individuals. Dismissing  adolescents showed behaviors promoting autonomy and relatedness less frequently  and to a lesser extent than secure ones, while displaying more often behaviors  undermining autonomy and relatedness in the FITs. Dismissing adolescents also  showed a more pronounced decrease in HRV during the FFI than secure and  preoccupied individuals; no differences were found between these groups in HRV  during the FITs. The results suggest that disorganized adolescents had more  difficulties in regulating their emotions during both the FFI and the FITs,  whereas dismissing individuals seemed effectively challenged only during the  interview.

The quality of the early care environment can buffer some of  the negative effects of prenatal adversity on child development. Retrospective  studies, in adult samples, highlight epigenetic modifications as sentinel  markers of the quality of the early care environment; however, comparable data  from pediatric cohorts are lacking. Participants were drawn from the Maternal  Adversity Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN) study, a longitudinal  cohort with measures of infant attachment, infant development, and child mental  health. Children provided buccal epithelial samples (mean age = 6.99, SD = 1.33  years, n = 226), which were used for analyses of genome-wide DNA methylation and  genetic variation. We used a series of linear models to describe the association  between infant attachment and (a) measures of child outcome and (b) DNA  methylation across the genome. Paired genetic data was used to determine the  genetic contribution to DNA methylation at attachment-associated sites. Infant  attachment style was associated with infant cognitive development (Mental  Development Index) and behavior (Behavior Rating Scale) assessed with the Bayley  Scales of Infant Development at 36 months. Infant attachment style moderated the  effects of prenatal adversity on Behavior Rating Scale scores at 36 months.  Infant attachment was also significantly associated with a principal component  that accounted for 11.9% of the variation in genome-wide DNA methylation. These  effects were most apparent when comparing children with a secure versus a  disorganized attachment style and most pronounced in females. The availability  of paired genetic data revealed that DNA methylation at approximately half of  all infant attachment-associated sites was best explained by considering both  infant attachment and child genetic variation. This study provides further  evidence that infant attachment can buffer some of the negative effects of early  adversity on measures of infant behavior. We also highlight the interplay  between infant attachment and child genotype in shaping variation in DNA  methylation. Such findings provide preliminary evidence for a molecular  signature of infant attachment and may help inform attachment-focused early  intervention programs.

This article provides an overview of selected ongoing international efforts that  have been inspired by Edward Zigler's vision to improve programs and policies  for young children and families in the United States. The efforts presented are  in close alignment with three strategies articulated by Edward Zigler: (a)  conduct research that will inform policy advocacy; (b) design, implement, and  revise quality early childhood development (ECD) programs; and (c) invest in  building the next generation of scholars and advocates in child development. The  intergenerational legacy left by Edward Zigler has had an impact on young  children not only in the United States, but also across the globe. More needs to  be done. We need to work together with a full commitment to ensure the optimal  development of each child.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000681 PMID: 32935656

Unresolved loss/trauma in the context of the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)  has been theorised to result from dissociative processing of fear-related  memories and ideas. To examine the plausibility of this model, this study tested  hypothesised associations between unresolved loss/trauma and indicators of  autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactivity. First-time pregnant women (N = 235)  participated in the AAI while heart rate (interbeat interval; IBI) and  indicators of parasympathetic reactivity (respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) and  sympathetic reactivity (pre-ejection period; PEP, skin conductance level; SCL)  were recorded. Using multilevel modelling, ANS reactivity was examined in  relation to topic (loss/trauma versus other questions); discussion of actual  loss/trauma; classification of unresolved/disorganised; and unresolved responses  during the interview. Responses to loss/trauma questions and discussion of loss  were associated with respectively larger and smaller IBIs. There was no  moderation by unresolved/disorganised status. Unresolved responses about loss  were associated with smaller IBIs. Participants classified as  unresolved/disorganised showed decreasing PEP and blunted SCL throughout the  whole interview. The findings suggest that unresolved speech about loss  co-occurs with physiological arousal, although the inconclusive findings  regarding parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system responses fail to  clearly support the role of fear.

Father-child play, child emotional dysregulation, and adolescent internalizing  symptoms: A longitudinal multiple mediation analysis.	Gregory J(1), Kivisto KL(1), Perdue NH(1), Estell DB(2).	Author information: (1)College of Applied and Behavioral Sciences, University of  Indianapolis,Indianapolis, IN,USA. (2)Department of Counseling and Educational Psychology,Indiana  University,Bloomington, IN,USA.	Emerging literature suggests fathers may contribute uniquely to child  development and emotional health through play. In the present study, a multiple  mediational model was analyzed using data from 476 families that participated in  the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. After accounting for  infant-mother attachment, infant temperament, and family income and stability, a  significant indirect effect from father-child play quality to adolescent  internalizing symptoms was found through father-reported child emotional  dysregulation, B = -.05, 95% confidence interval; CI [-.14, -.01]. Specifically,  in first grade, dyads where fathers were rated highly on sensitivity and  stimulation during play, and children demonstrated high felt security and  affective mutuality during play, had children with fewer father-reported  emotional dysregulation problems in third grade, B = -.23, 95% CI [-.39, -.06].  Children with fewer emotional dysregulation problems had lower self-reported  internalizing symptoms at age 15, B = .23, 95% CI [.01, .45]. Mothers' ratings  of children's emotional dysregulation were not a significant mediator. Results  are discussed regarding the importance of father-child play for children's  adjustment as well as the usefulness of inclusion of fathers in child  developmental research.

Emotion dysregulation, temperamental vulnerability, and parental depression in  adolescents: Correspondence between physiological and informant-report measures.

(2)Department of Experimental, Clinical, and Health Psychology,Ghent  University,Belgium.	Although numerous studies reveal altered respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)  among children, adolescents, and adults who exhibit emotion dysregulation,  effects of temperamental vulnerability and parental mental health on RSA remain  unclear. We evaluated the relationship among emotion regulation, RSA, and RSA  reactivity in a pooled sample of 24 vulnerable and 31 resilient adolescents  (mean age = 13.69 years; 60% girls), including associations with temperamental  vulnerability and parental depressive symptoms. Participants watched a neutral  film clip while their resting RSA was recorded, and then completed a reward and  frustration task, using an affective Posner paradigm. Temperament and emotion  regulation were assessed via self-report and parent report, and parents reported  on their own depressive symptoms. Low resting RSA was associated with  temperamental negative emotionality, whereas greater RSA reactivity to  frustration was associated with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. No  significant relations were found between RSA and parental depressive symptoms.  This study elucidates the role of RSA as a biomarker of individual differences  in emotion dysregulation and temperamental vulnerability and stresses the  importance of considering multiple units of analyses, as well as functional  domains, when studying emotional responding and regulation in adolescents.

Parsing neurodevelopmental features of irritability and anxiety: Replication and  validation of a latent variable approach.	Cardinale EM(1), Kircanski K(1), Brooks J(1), Gold AL(1), Towbin KE(1), Pine  DS(1), Leibenluft E(1), Brotman MA(1).	Author information: (1)Emotion and Development Branch,National Institute of Mental  Health,Bethesda,MD,USA.	Irritability and anxiety are two common clinical phenotypes that involve  high-arousal negative affect states (anger and fear), and that frequently  co-occur. Elucidating how these two forms of emotion dysregulation relate to  perturbed neurodevelopment may benefit from alternate phenotyping strategies.  One such strategy applies a bifactor latent variable approach that can parse  shared versus unique mechanisms of these two phenotypes. Here, we aim to  replicate and extend this approach and examine associations with neural  structure in a large transdiagnostic sample of youth (N = 331; M = 13.57, SD =  2.69 years old; 45.92% male). FreeSurfer was used to extract cortical thickness,  cortical surface area, and subcortical volume. The current findings replicated  the bifactor model and demonstrate measurement invariance as a function of youth  age and sex. There were no associations of youth's factor scores with cortical  thickness, surface area, or subcortical volume. However, we found strong  convergent and divergent validity between parent-reported irritability and  anxiety factors with clinician-rated symptoms and impairment. A general negative  affectivity factor was robustly associated with overall functional impairment  across symptom domains. Together, these results support the utility of the  bifactor model as an alternative phenotyping strategy for irritability and  anxiety, which may aid in the development of targeted treatments.

(3)National and Specialist Child Traumatic Stress and Anxiety Clinic, South  London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.	The present study used a longitudinal and discordant twin design to explore in  depth the developmental associations between victimization and loneliness from  mid-childhood to young adulthood. The data were drawn from the Environmental  Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a birth cohort of 2,232 individuals born  in England and Wales during 1994-1995. Diverse forms of victimization were  considered, differing across context, perpetrator, and timing of exposure. The  results indicated that exposure to different forms of victimization was  associated with loneliness in a dose-response manner. In childhood, bullying  victimization was uniquely associated with loneliness, over and above concurrent  psychopathology, social isolation, and genetic risk. Moreover, childhood  bullying victimization continued to predict loneliness in young adulthood, even  in the absence of ongoing victimization. Within-twin pair analyses further  indicated that this longitudinal association was explained by genetic confounds.  In adolescence, varied forms of victimization were correlated with young adult  loneliness, with maltreatment, neglect, and cybervictimization remaining robust  to controls for genetic confounds. These findings indicate that vulnerability to  loneliness in victimized young people varies according to the specific form of  victimization in question, and also to the developmental period in which it was  experienced.

Blaisdell KN(1), Barker TV(1), Giuliano RJ(2), Fisher PA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Oregon, Department of Psychology, OR, USA. (2)University of Manitoba, Department of Psychology. Winnipeg, Canada.	The majority of children living in foster care in the United States have a  history of maltreatment and/or disrupted caregiving. Maltreatment in early  childhood adversely affects development at many levels, including neurobiology  and behavior. One neurobiological measure associated with maltreatment is alpha  electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry. Prior research has found greater right  frontal asymmetry among children with a history of maltreatment. However, little  research has been extended developmentally downward to examine alpha asymmetry  and its behavioral correlates among toddlers in foster care; this was the  purpose of the present study. Differences in EEG asymmetry were examined between  a sample of foster toddlers (mean age = 3.21 years, n = 38) and a community  comparison, low-income sample without a history of foster care (mean age = 3.04  years, n = 16). The toddlers in the foster care group exhibited greater right  alpha asymmetry, primarily driven by differences in parietal asymmetry. Neither  frontal nor parietal asymmetry were clearly related to internalizing or  externalizing behaviors, measured concurrently or at previous time points. These  findings reveal differences in alpha EEG asymmetry among toddlers in foster  care, and highlight the need to better understand associations between  neurobiological and behavioral functioning following early adversity.

Exposure to early life adversity (ELA) is associated with increased rates of  psychopathology and poor physical health. The present study builds on  foundational work by Megan Gunnar identifying how ELA results in poor long-term  outcomes through alterations in the stress response system, leading to major  disruptions in emotional and behavioral regulation. Specifically, the present  study tested the direct effects of ELA against the role of parent socialization  to shed light on the mechanisms by which ELA leads to emotion regulation  deficits. Children ages 4-7 years (N = 64) completed interviews about their  experiences of deprivation and threat, a fear conditioning and extinction  paradigm, and an IQ test. Parents of the children completed questionnaires  regarding their own emotion regulation difficulties and psychopathology, their  children's emotion regulation, and child exposure to adversity. At the bivariate  level, greater exposure to threat and parental difficulties with emotion  regulation were associated with poorer emotion regulation in children, assessed  both via parental report and physiologically. In models where parental  difficulties with emotion regulation, threat, and deprivation were introduced  simultaneously, regression results indicated that parental difficulties with  emotion regulation, but not deprivation or threat, continued to predict  children's emotion regulation abilities. These results suggest that parental  socialization of emotion is a robust predictor of emotion regulation tendencies  in children exposed to early adversity.

Social-communication skills emerge within the context of rich social  interactions, facilitated by an infant's capacity to attend to people and  objects in the environment. Disruption in this early neurobehavioral process may  decrease the frequency and quality of social interactions and learning  opportunities, potentially leading to downstream deleterious effects on social  development. This study examined early attention in infant siblings of children  with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who are at risk for social and communication  delays. Visual and auditory attention was mapped from age 1 week to 5 months in  infants at familial risk for ASD (high risk; N = 41) and low-risk typically  developing infants (low risk; N = 39). At 12 months, a subset of participants (N  = 40) was administered assessments of social communication and nonverbal  cognitive skills. Results revealed that high-risk infants performed lower on  attention tasks at 2 and 3 months of age compared to low-risk infants. A  significant association between overall attention at 3 months and developmental  outcome at 12 months was observed for both groups. These results provide  evidence for early vulnerabilities in visual attention for infants at risk for  ASD during a period of important neurodevelopmental transition (between 2 and 3  months) when attention has significant implications for social communication and  cognitive development.

Dyadic synchrony and repair processes are related to preschool children's risk  exposure and self-control.	Scholtes CM(1), Lyons ER(1), Skowron EA(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Counseling Psychology & Human Services, University of Oregon,  Eugene, OR, USA. (2)Department of Psychology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA.	We examined associations between preschool children's cumulative risk exposure,  dyadic interaction patterns, and self-control abilities in 238 mother-child  dyads. Positive interactive synchrony, relationship ruptures, and latency to  repair were micro-coded during a 3-5 minute joint challenge task. Children's  self-control was assessed via two laboratory tasks and by parent report.  Structural equation modeling and mediation analyses were utilized to examine the  direct and indirect effects of cumulative risk on children's observed and  parent-reported self-control abilities. Parent-child interactive processes of  dyadic synchrony and latency to repair ruptures in synchrony were examined as  mediators. Dyadic synchrony and latency to repair ruptures were found to mediate  associations between cumulative risk exposure and children's behavioral and  parent-reported self-control. Children exposed to more cumulative risk engaged  in less dyadic synchrony and experienced longer latencies to repair ruptures  with their caregiver, which in turn was associated with lower child  self-control. Though cross-sectional, findings suggest dyadic synchrony and  repair processes may represent viable mechanistic pathways linking cumulative  risk exposure and deficits in child self-control. However, independent  replications using longitudinal and experimental intervention designs are needed  to determine causal pathways and inform new approaches for targeting the effects  of early risk exposure through a focus on two-generational interventions.

Emotional distress during pregnancy is likely influenced by both maternal  history of adversity and concurrent prenatal stressors, but prospective  longitudinal studies are lacking. Guided by a life span model of pregnancy  health and stress sensitization theories, this study investigated the influence  of intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy on the association between  childhood adversity and prenatal emotional distress. Participants included an  urban, community-based sample of 200 pregnant women (aged 18-24) assessed  annually from ages 8 to 17 for a range of adversity domains, including traumatic  violence, harsh parenting, caregiver loss, and compromised parenting. Models  tested both linear and nonlinear effects of adversity as well as their  interactions with IPV on prenatal anxiety and depression symptoms, controlling  for potential confounds such as poverty and childhood anxiety and depression.  Results showed that the associations between childhood adversity and pregnancy  emotional distress were moderated by prenatal IPV, supporting a life span  conceptualization of pregnancy health. Patterns of interactions were nonlinear,  consistent with theories conceptualizing stress sensitization through an  "adaptive calibration" lens. Furthermore, results diverged based on adversity  subdomain and type of prenatal IPV (physical vs. emotional abuse). Findings are  discussed in the context of existing stress sensitization theories and highlight  important avenues for future research and practice.

Author information: (1)School of Nursing and Midwifery & Centre for Evidence and Social Innovation,  Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK. (2)School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.	Early signs of anger and aggression can be identified in infancy. Our aim was to  use person-centered methods to identify which infants were most at risk for  clinically significant behavioral problems by age 3 and diagnoses of ODD/CD by 7  years, while considering the role of family risk factors and positive parenting.  A representative British community sample of 304 infants was assessed by  multiple informants at mean ages of 6, 21, and 36 months of age. Latent  Transition Analysis (LTA) identified three ordered subgroups at each age, with  one subgroup (18%) displaying high levels of physical force as well as anger.  These angry aggressive infants were at elevated risk for behavioral problems in  early childhood and diagnoses of conduct disorder (CD) and/or oppositional  defiant disorder (ODD) at 7 years of age. After other risk factors were taken  into account, parents' beliefs in warm parenting and their observed positive  affect while interacting with their infants were protective factors. These  findings indicate the significance of very early manifestations of angry  aggressiveness and have relevance for developmental theories of aggression and  prevention strategies.

Author information: (1)Johns Hopkins University.	There remains little debate that the period before birth sets the stage for  subsequent development, yet scant evidence exists showing continuity from  characteristics of the individual fetus to characteristics of the child. This  report examines, in two studies, whether baseline and evoked fetal  neurobehavioral functioning are predictive of features of child temperament and  behavior as reported by mothers when offspring were between 7 and 14 years old  (M = 10.1 years). Study 1 utilizes data generated from 333 maternal-fetal pairs  collected during an undisturbed condition during the second half of gestation in  relation to the child temperament dimensions of behavioral inhibition and  exuberance. Associations at 32 weeks gestation were detected between all  features of fetal neurobehavior and behavioral inhibition. In adjusted models,  slower fetal heart rate and less fetal movement were associated with significant  unique variance in predicting higher levels of childhood behavioral inhibition.  No associations were detected for exuberance. Study 2 focuses on the association  of evoked fetal reactivity and recovery to induced maternal arousal with  subsequent child behavioral difficulties in a subset of the full sample (n =  130). Greater recovery in fetal heart rate following maternal stimulation was  predictive of fewer behavioral difficulties and more prosocial behavior in  childhood. Results from both studies provide support for gestational origins of  core individual differences that portend childhood outcomes with foundational  reactivity and regulatory components.

Cardinale EM(1), Subar AR(1), Brotman MA(1), Leibenluft E(1), Kircanski K(1),  Pine DS(1).	Author information: (1)Emotion and Development Branch,National Institute of Mental Health,Bethesda,  MD,USA.	While emotional dysregulation is a broad construct, the current paper adopts a  narrow approach to facilitate translational neuroscience research on pediatric  anxiety. The paper first presents data on an adapted version of the antisaccade  task and then integrates these data into a research framework. Data on an  adapted version of the antisaccade task were collected in 57 youth, including 35  seeking treatment for an anxiety disorder. Associations were examined between  performance on the antisaccade task and (a) age, (b) performance on other  cognitive-control tasks (i.e., the stop-signal delay and flanker tasks), and (c)  level of anxiety symptoms. Better performance on the antisaccade task occurred  in older relative to younger subjects and correlated with better performance on  the flanker task. Across the 57 youth, higher levels of anxiety correlated with  shorter latency for correct antisaccades. These data can be placed within a  three-step framework for translational neuroscience research. In the first step,  a narrow index of emotion dysregulation is targeted. In the second step, this  narrow index is linked to other correlated indicators of the same underlying  narrow latent construct. In the third and final step, associations are examined  with clinical outcomes and response to treatment.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419000300 PMCID: PMC7439288 PMID: 30968800 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder  characterized by deficits in social communication and presence of restricted,  repetitive behaviors, and interests. However, individuals with ASD vary  significantly in their challenges and abilities in these and other developmental  domains. Gene discovery in ASD has accelerated in the past decade, and genetic  subtyping has yielded preliminary evidence of utility in parsing phenotypic  heterogeneity through genomic subtypes. Recent advances in transcriptomics have  provided additional dimensions with which to refine genetic subtyping efforts.  In the current study, we investigate phenotypic differences among  transcriptional subtypes defined by neurobiological spatiotemporal co-expression  patterns. Of the four transcriptional subtypes examined, participants with  mutations to genes typically expressed highly in all brain regions prenatally,  and those with differential postnatal cerebellar expression relative to other  brain regions, showed lower cognitive and adaptive skills, higher severity of  social communication deficits, and later acquisition of speech and motor  milestones, compared to those with mutations to genes highly expressed during  the postnatal period across brain regions. These findings suggest higher-order  characterization of genetic subtypes based on neurobiological expression  patterns may be a promising approach to parsing phenotypic heterogeneity among  those with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders.

Allswede DM(1), Cannon TD(1).	Author information: (1)Yale University.	Prenatal inflammation is an established risk factor for schizophrenia. However,  the specific inflammatory pathways that mediate this association remain unclear.  Potential candidate systems include inflammatory markers produced by microglia,  such as cytokines and complement. Accumulating evidence suggests that these  markers play a role in typical neurodevelopmental processes, such as synapse  formation and interneuron migration. Rodent models demonstrate that altered  marker levels during the prenatal period can cause lasting deficits in these  systems, leading to cognitive deficits that resemble schizophrenia. This review  assesses the potential role of prenatal cytokine and complement elevations on  the etiology of schizophrenia. The current neurobiological understanding of the  development of schizophrenia is reviewed to identify candidate cellular  mechanisms that may be influenced by prenatal inflammation. We discuss the  functions that cytokines and complement may play in prenatal neurodevelopment,  review evidence that links exposure to these factors with risk for  schizophrenia, and consider how these markers may interact with genetic  vulnerabilities to influence the neurodevelopment of schizophrenia. We consider  how prenatal inflammatory exposure may influence childhood and adolescent  developmental risk trajectories for schizophrenia. Finally, we identify areas of  further research needed to support the development of anti-inflammatory  treatments to prevent the development of schizophrenia in at-risk neonates.

Trajectories and Predictors of Children's Early-Starting Conduct Problems:  Child, Family, Genetic, and Intervention Effects.

Several research teams have previously traced patterns of emerging conduct  problems (CP) from early or middle childhood. The current study expands on this  previous literature by using a genetically-informed, experimental, and long-term  longitudinal design to examine trajectories of early-emerging conduct problems  and early childhood discriminators of such patterns from the toddler period to  adolescence. The sample represents a cohort of 731 toddlers and diverse families  recruited based on socioeconomic, child, and family risk, varying in urbanicity  and assessed on nine occasions between ages 2 and 14. In addition to examining  child, family, and community level discriminators of patterns of emerging  conduct problems, we were able to account for genetic susceptibility using  polygenic scores and the study's experimental design to determine whether random  assignment to the Family Check-Up (FCU) discriminated trajectory groups. In  addition, in accord with differential susceptibility theory, we tested whether  the effects of the FCU were stronger for those children with higher genetic  susceptibility. Results augmented previous findings documenting the influence of  child (inhibitory control [IC], gender) and family (harsh parenting, parental  depression, and educational attainment) risk. In addition, children in the FCU  were overrepresented in the persistent low versus persistent high CP group, but  such direct effects were qualified by an interaction between the intervention  and genetic susceptibility that was consistent with differential susceptibility.  Implications are discussed for early identification and specifically, prevention  efforts addressing early child and family risk.

Maternal thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy may contribute to offspring  neurobehavioral disorders. In this paper, we investigate the relationship  between maternal thyroid function during pregnancy and offspring depression and  anxiety. Data were taken from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and  Children. A total of 2,920 mother-child pairs were included. Thyroid-stimulating  hormone levels, free thyroxine (FT4), and thyroid peroxidase antibodies were  assessed during the first trimester of pregnancy because maternal supply is the  only source of thyroid hormone for the fetus during the first 12 weeks of  gestation. Child symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed using the  Development and Well-Being Assessment at ages 7.5 and 15 years. The odds of  presenting with depression and anxiety were estimated using the generalized  estimating equation. The level of FT4 during the first trimester of pregnancy  was associated with child depression combined at ages 7.5 and 15 (odds ratio =  1.21, 95% confidence interval [1.00, 1.14]. An increase of 1 standard deviation  of FT4 during pregnancy increased the odds of child depression by 28% after  adjustment made for potential confounders. No association was found among  maternal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, FT4, and thyroid peroxidase  antibodies and childhood anxiety. In conclusion, increased levels of FT4 during  the first trimester of pregnancy appear be linked to greater risk of offspring  depression.

(2)Department of Pediatrics, Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine, University of  California, San Francisco, CA, USA.	There is an extensive literature describing the detrimental effects of adverse  childhood experiences (ACE; e.g., abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction) on  physical and mental health. However, few large-scale studies have explored these  associations longitudinally in urban minority cohorts or assessed links to  broader measures of well-being such as educational attainment, occupation, and  crime. Although adversity and resilience have long been of interest in  developmental psychology, protective and promotive factors have been  understudied in the ACE literature. This paper investigates the psychosocial  processes through which ACEs contribute to outcomes, in addition to exploring  ways to promote resilience to ACEs in vulnerable populations. Follow-up data  were analyzed for 87% of the original 1,539 participants in the Chicago  Longitudinal Study (N = 1,341), a prospective investigation of the impact of an  Early Childhood Education program and early experiences on life-course  well-being. Findings suggest that ACEs impact well-being in low-socioeconomic  status participants above and beyond the effects of demographic risk and  poverty, and point to possible mechanisms of transmission of ACE effects.  Results also identify key areas across the ecological system that may promote  resilience to ACEs, and speak to the need to continue to support underserved  communities in active ways.

DePasquale CE(1), Handley ED(2), Cicchetti D(1).	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development,University of Minnesota-Twin  Cities,Minneapolis,MN,USA. (2)Mt. Hope Family Center,University of Rochester,Rochester,MN,USA.	The impact of maltreatment spreads across many developmental domains and extends  across the entire life span. Identifying unidirectional or bidirectional drivers  of developmental cascades of the effects of maltreatment experiences is critical  to efficiently employing interventions to promote resilient development in  maltreated children. This 1-year longitudinal study utilized a multiple-levels  approach, investigating "bottom-up" and "top-down" cascades using structural  equation modeling between cortisol regulation, externalizing behavior, and peer  aggression. Neither a bottom-up model driven by cortisol regulation nor a  top-down model driven by peer aggression fit the data well. Instead, lower rates  of externalizing behavior at Year 1 most strongly predicted improvements at all  levels of analysis (reduced cortisol, externalizing behavior, and peer  aggression) at Year 2. These results provide initial indication of a mechanism  through which interventions for maltreated children may be most effective and  result in the most substantial positive changes across developmental domains.

The codevelopment of internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and  cognitive ability across childhood and adolescence.	Papachristou E(1), Flouri E(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education,  University College London, London, UK.	Cognitive ability, externalizing symptoms, and internalizing symptoms are  correlated in children. However, it is not known why they combine in the general  child population over time. To address this, we used data on 17,318 children  participating in the UK Millennium Cohort Study and followed-up five times  between ages 3 and 14 years. We fitted three parallel-process latent growth  curve models to identify the parallel unfolding of children's trajectories of  internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and cognitive ability across  this period. We also examined the effects of time-invariant (ethnicity, birth  weight, maternal education and age at birth, and breastfeeding status) and  time-varying covariates (maternal psychological distress and socioeconomic  disadvantage) on the growth parameters of the trajectories. The results showed  that the intercepts of the trajectories of cognitive ability and, particularly,  externalizing symptoms were inversely correlated. Their linear slopes were also  inversely correlated, suggesting parallel development. Internalizing symptoms  were correlated positively with externalizing symptoms and inversely (and more  modestly) with cognitive ability at baseline, but the slope of internalizing  symptoms correlated (positively) only with the slope of externalizing symptoms.  The covariates predicted 9% to 41% of the variance in the intercepts and slopes  of all domains, suggesting they are important common risk factors. Overall, it  appears that externalizing symptoms develop in parallel with both cognitive  ability and internalizing symptoms from early childhood through to middle  adolescence. Children on an increasing trajectory of externalizing symptoms are  likely both increasing in internalizing symptoms and decreasing in cognitive  skills as well, and are thus an important group to target for intervention.

Research showing that risk for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder with psychosis,  and other psychosis-spectrum diagnoses in adulthood is multidetermined has  underscored the necessity of studying the additive and interactive factors in  childhood that precede and predict future disorders. In this study, risk for the  development of psychosis-spectrum disorders was examined in a 2-generation,  30-year prospective longitudinal study of 3,905 urban families against a  sociocultural backdrop of changing economic and social conditions. Peer  nominations of aggression, withdrawal, and likeability and national census  information on neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood, as  well as changes in neighborhood socioeconomic conditions over the lifespan, were  examined as predictors of diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and  other psychosis-spectrum disorders in adulthood relative to developing only  nonpsychotic disorders or no psychiatric disorders. Individuals who were both  highly aggressive and highly withdrawn were at greater risk for other  psychosis-spectrum diagnoses when they experienced greater neighborhood  disadvantage in childhood or worsening neighborhood conditions over maturation.  Males who were highly aggressive but low on withdrawal were at greater risk for  schizophrenia diagnoses. Childhood neighborhood disadvantage predicted both  schizophrenia and bipolar diagnoses, regardless of childhood social behavior.  Results provided strong support for multiple-domain models of psychopathology,  and suggest that universal preventive interventions and social policies aimed at  improving neighborhood conditions may be particularly important for decreasing  the prevalence of psychosis-spectrum diagnoses in the future.

Early adversity and children's regulatory deficits: Does postadoption parenting  facilitate recovery in postinstitutionalized children?	Koss KJ(1), Lawler JM(2), Gunnar MR(3).	Author information: (1)Human Development and Family Science, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA. (2)Psychology Department, Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, MI, USA. (3)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN,  USA.	Children reared in orphanages typically experience the lack of stable, reliable  caregivers and are at increased risk for deficits in regulatory abilities  including difficulties in inhibitory control, attention, and emotion regulation.  Although adoption results in a radical shift in caregiving quality, there  remains variation in postadoption parenting, yet little research has examined  postadoption parenting that may promote recovery in children experiencing early  life adversity in the form of institutional care. Participants included 93  postinstitutionalized children adopted between 15 and 36 months of age and 52  nonadopted same-aged peers. Parenting was assessed four times during the first 2  years postadoption (at 2, 8, 16, and 24 months postadoption) and children's  regulation was assessed at age 5 (M age = 61.68 months) and during kindergarten  (M age = 71.55 months). Multiple parenting dimensions including  sensitivity/responsiveness, structure/limit setting, and consistency in routines  were examined. Both parental sensitivity and structure moderated the effect of  preadoption adversity on children's emotion regulation while greater consistency  was associated with better inhibitory control and fewer attention problems.  Results support the notion that postadoption parenting during toddlerhood and  the early preschool years promotes better regulation skills following early  adversity.

Less is known about the relationship between conduct disorder (CD),  callous-unemotional (CU) traits, and positive and negative parenting in youth  compared to early childhood. We combined traditional univariate analyses with a  novel machine learning classifier (Angle-based Generalized Matrix Learning  Vector Quantization) to classify youth (N = 756; 9-18 years) into typically  developing (TD) or CD groups with or without elevated CU traits (CD/HCU, CD/LCU,  respectively) using youth- and parent-reports of parenting behavior. At the  group level, both CD/HCU and CD/LCU were associated with high negative and low  positive parenting relative to TD. However, only positive parenting differed  between the CD/HCU and CD/LCU groups. In classification analyses, performance  was best when distinguishing CD/HCU from TD groups and poorest when  distinguishing CD/HCU from CD/LCU groups. Positive and negative parenting were  both relevant when distinguishing CD/HCU from TD, negative parenting was most  relevant when distinguishing between CD/LCU and TD, and positive parenting was  most relevant when distinguishing CD/HCU from CD/LCU groups. These findings  suggest that while positive parenting distinguishes between CD/HCU and CD/LCU,  negative parenting is associated with both CD subtypes. These results highlight  the importance of considering multiple parenting behaviors in CD with varying  levels of CU traits in late childhood/adolescence.

Difficulties with emotion regulation can take many forms, including increased  sensitivity to emotional cues and habitual use of maladaptive cognitive or  behavioral regulation strategies. Despite extensive research on emotion  regulation and youth adjustment, few studies integrate multiple measures of  emotion regulation. The present study evaluated the underlying structure of  emotion regulation processes in adolescence using both task- and survey-based  measures and determined whether differences in these emotion regulation latent  factors mediated the association between peer victimization and internalizing  psychopathology. Adolescents aged 16-17 years (n = 287; 55% female; 42% White)  recruited in three urban centers in the United States completed baseline and  follow-up assessments 4 months apart. Three models of emotion regulation were  evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis. A three-factor model fit the data  best, including cognitive regulation, behavioral regulation, and emotional  reactivity latent factors. Task-based measures did not load onto these latent  factors. Difficulties with behavioral regulation mediated the association  between peer victimization and depression symptoms, whereas cognitive regulation  difficulties mediated the association with anxiety symptoms. Findings point to  potential targets for intervention efforts to reduce risk for internalizing  problems in adolescents following experiences of peer victimization.

Ed Zigler was a champion for underprivileged youth, one who worked alongside  communities to fight for long-lasting systemic changes that were informed by his  lifespan and ecological perspective on the development of the whole child. This  paper reports on the development, implementation, and preliminary outcomes of an  intervention that embodied the Zigler approach by adopting a community  participatory research lens to integrate complementary insights across  community-based providers (promotoras), Latinx immigrant families, and  developmental psychologists in the service of promoting parent-child  relationship quality and preventing youth aggression and violence. Analyses from  the first 112 Latinx mother-youth dyad participants (46% female children, ages  8-17) in the resultant, Confía en mí, Confío en ti, eight-week intervention  revealed significant pre-post increases in purported mechanisms of change (i.e.,  attachment security, reflective functioning) and early intervention outcomes  (i.e., depressive, anxiety, and externalizing problems).

We discuss future directions for  the program, as well as challenges to its sustainability. Finally, we consider  Ed's legacy as we discuss the contributions of this work to developmental  science and our understanding of attachment relationships among low-income  immigrant Latinx families.

Decades of research have highlighted the significance of parenting in children's  development, yet few studies have focused specifically on the development of  parental monitoring strategies in diverse families living in at-risk  neighborhoods. The current study investigated the development of active (i.e.,  parental discussions and curfew rules) and passive (i.e., child communication  with parents) parental monitoring strategies across different developmental  periods (middle childhood and adolescence; Grades 4-5 and 7-11) as well as  individual (child, parent), family, and contextual antecedents (measured in  kindergarten) of this parenting behavior. Using an ecological approach, this  study evaluated longitudinal data from 753 participants in the Fast Track  Project, a multisite study directed at the development and prevention of conduct  problems in at-risk children. Latent trajectory modeling results identified  little to no mean growth in these monitoring strategies over time, suggesting  that families living in at-risk environments may engage in consistent levels of  monitoring strategies to ensure children's safety and well-being. Findings also  identified several kindergarten antecedents of the growth factors of these  parental monitoring strategies including (a) early child conduct problems; (b)  parental warmth/involvement, satisfaction, and efficacy; and (c) parent-child  relationship quality. These predictive effects largely highlighted the important  role of early parenting behaviors on later levels of and growth in parental  monitoring strategies. These findings have important implications for potential  prevention and intervention targets to promote the development of parental  monitoring strategies among families living in more at-risk contexts.

Yarger HA(1), Redcay E(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Maryland, MD, USA.	This paper reviews and synthesizes key areas of research related to the  etiology, development, and maintenance of internalizing symptoms in children,  adolescents, and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In developing an  integrated conceptual model, we draw from current conceptual models of  internalizing symptoms in ASD and extend the model to include factors related to  internalizing within other populations (e.g., children that have experienced  early life stress, children with other neurodevelopmental conditions, typically  developing children) that have not been systematically examined in ASD. Our  review highlights the need for more research to understand the developmental  course of internalizing symptoms, potential moderators, and the interplay  between early risk and protective factors. Longitudinal studies incorporating  multiple methods and both environmental and biological factors will be important  in order to elucidate these mechanisms.

Relational victimization typically emerges first during the elementary school  period, and has been associated with increased levels of internalizing symptoms  in children. Individual differences in autonomic nervous system functioning have  been suggested as a potential factor linking social stressors and internalizing  symptoms. The aim of this study was therefore to examine whether heart rate and  heart rate variability mediated the association between relational victimization  and internalizing symptoms in 373 mainstream elementary school children.  Children were assessed in 2015 (T0; Grades 3-5, M age = 9.78 years, 51% boys)  and reassessed in 2016 (T1). Heart rate and heart rate variability were assessed  during a regular school day at T1. A multi-informant (teacher and peer report)  cross-time measure of relational victimization, and a multi-informant (self- and  teacher report) measure of internalizing problems at T1 was used. Results showed  that heart rate variability, but not heart rate, mediated the association  between relational victimization and internalizing symptoms. This study provides  tentative support that in children from a general population sample, a  psychobiological factor may mediate the association of relational victimization  with internalizing symptoms.

Currently, two main approaches exist to distinguish differential susceptibility  from diathesis-stress and vantage sensitivity in Genotype × Environment  interaction (G × E) research: regions of significance (RoS) and  competitive-confirmatory approaches. Each is limited by its  single-gene/single-environment foci given that most phenotypes are the product  of multiple interacting genetic and environmental factors. We thus addressed  these two concerns in a recently developed R package (LEGIT) for constructing G  × E interaction models with latent genetic and environmental scores using  alternating optimization. Herein we test, by means of computer simulation,  diverse G × E models in the context of both single and multiple genes and  environments. Results indicate that the RoS and competitive-confirmatory  approaches were highly accurate when the sample size was large, whereas the  latter performed better in small samples and for small effect sizes. The  competitive-confirmatory approach generally had good accuracy (a) when effect  size was moderate and N ≥ 500 and (b) when effect size was large and N ≥ 250,  whereas RoS performed poorly. Computational tools to determine the type of G × E  of multiple genes and environments are provided as extensions in our LEGIT R  package.

There is emerging evidence that the development of problematic aggression in  childhood may be associated with specific physiological stress response  patterns, with both biological overactivation and underactivation implicated.  This study tested associations between sex-specific patterns of stress responses  across the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA) axis and peer nominations of aggression among 271 kindergarten children  (Mean age = 5.32 years; 52% Female; 44% White). Upon entry to kindergarten,  children participated in a multidomain standardized stress paradigm. Changes in  pre-ejection period (PEP) and salivary cortisol were assessed. On a separate  day, children provided peer ratings of physical and relational aggression in a  standardized interview. As expected, there was a significant three-way  interaction between PEP, cortisol reactivity, and sex, but only for physical  aggression. Among boys, cortisol reactivity was positively associated with  physical aggression only for those with higher SNS reactivity. Findings suggest  that for boys, asymmetrical and symmetrical HPA/SNS reactivity may be associated  with lower and higher risk for peer-directed physical aggression, respectively.  Understanding the complex associations between multisystem physiology, child sex  and peer-directed aggression in early childhood may offer insight into  individual differences underlying the emergence of behavioral dysregulation in  early peer contexts.

Despite the strong link between childhood maltreatment and psychopathology, the  underlying neurodevelopmental mechanisms are poorly understood and difficult to  disentangle from heritable and prenatal factors. This study used a translational  macaque model of infant maltreatment in which the adverse experience occurs in  the first months of life, during intense maturation of amygdala circuits  important for stress and emotional regulation. Thus, we examined the  developmental impact of maltreatment on amygdala functional connectivity (FC)  longitudinally, from infancy through the juvenile period. Using resting state  functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we performed amygdala-prefrontal  cortex (PFC) region-of-interest and exploratory whole-brain amygdala FC  analyses. The latter showed (a) developmental increases in amygdala FC with many  regions, likely supporting increased processing of socioemotional-relevant  stimuli with age; and (b) maltreatment effects on amygdala coupling with arousal  and stress brain regions (locus coeruleus, laterodorsal tegmental area) that  emerged with age. Maltreated juveniles showed weaker FC than controls, which was  negatively associated with infant hair cortisol concentrations. Findings from  the region-of-interest analysis also showed weaker amygdala FC with PFC regions  in maltreated animals than controls since infancy, whereas bilateral amygdala FC  was stronger in maltreated animals. These effects on amygdala FC development may  underlie the poor behavioral outcomes associated with this adverse experience.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001133 PMID: 33427167 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

(3)Authentic Connections, Cambridge, MA, USA.	In interventions for at-risk children, Tom Dishion strongly exhorted programs  that are short term, cost-effective, and delivered in families' own communities,  just as resilience researchers underscore the need for programs that provide  ongoing support for children's primary caregivers, and are implementable on a  large scale. Presented here are preliminary results on a short-term intervention  for mothers, the Authentic Connections Virtual Groups. A previous randomized  trial of the in-person version of this program, conducted with mothers at high  risk for stress and burnout, showed significant benefits. There had been zero  dropouts across the 3-month program, and participants showed significant  improvements on psychological indices as well as cortisol, even 3 months after  the program ended. In the present study, virtual groups were conducted with five  sets of women, all white-collar professionals with highly stressful, exacting  careers, and most also primary caregivers of their children. Again, there were  zero dropouts. Mean satisfaction ratings were 9.6 of 10, and the Net Promoter  Score (promoters vs. detractors) fell in the "world class" range. To illuminate  mechanisms of change, participants' responses to open-ended questions on the  groups' value are presented verbatim. Recurrently mentioned were the development  of new, authentic connections and invaluable ongoing support. These results,  with the low costs and ease of women's attendance, attest to the value of  expanding offerings such as these, toward benefiting even more highly stressed  mothers themselves as well as the children for whose care they are responsible.

The current study examined whether social status and social integration, two  related but distinct indicators of an adolescent's standing within a peer  network, mediate the association between risky symptoms (depressive symptoms and  deviant behavior) and substance use across adolescence. The sample of 6,776  adolescents participated in up to seven waves of data collection spanning 6th to  12th grades. Scores indexing social status and integration were derived from a  social network analysis of six schools and subsequent psychometric modeling.  Results of latent growth models showed that social integration and status  mediated the relation between risky symptoms and substance use and that risky  symptoms mediated the relation between social standing and substance use during  the high school transition. Before this transition, pathways involving deviant  behavior led to high social integration and status and in turn to substance use.  After this transition, both deviant behavior and depressive symptoms led to low  social integration and status and in turn greater substance use. These findings  suggest that the high school transition is a risky time for substance use  related to the interplay of increases in depressive symptoms and deviant  behavior on the one hand and decreases in social status and integration on the  other.

There is now a clear focus on incorporating, and integrating, multiple levels of  analysis in developmental science. The current study adds to research in this  area by including markers of the immune and neuroendocrine systems in a  longitudinal study of temperament in infants. Observational and parent-reported  ratings of infant temperament, serum markers of the innate immune system, and  cortisol reactivity from repeated salivary collections were examined in a sample  of 123 infants who were assessed at 6 months and again when they were, on  average, 17 months old. Blood from venipuncture was collected for analyses of  nine select innate immune cytokines; salivary cortisol collected prior to and 15  min and 30 min following a physical exam including blood draw was used as an  index of neuroendocrine functioning. Analyses indicated fairly minimal  significant associations between biological markers and temperament at 6 months.  However, by 17 months of age, we found reliable and nonoverlapping associations  between observed fearful temperament and biological markers of the immune and  neuroendocrine systems. The findings provide some of the earliest evidence of  robust biological correlates of fear behavior with the immune system, and  identify possible immune and neuroendocrine mechanisms for understanding the  origins of behavioral development.

(2)University Centre for Research on Youth and Family,Québec City,Canada.	Exposure to maltreatment during childhood (CM) can have deleterious effects  throughout the life span of an individual. A parent's history of child  maltreatment can also impact his or her own parenting behavior. Theoretically,  parents who experienced maltreatment as children may have fewer resources to  cope with the challenges of childrearing and may adopt more problematic  parenting behaviors. However, empirical studies examining the association  between CM and later parenting behavior have yielded mixed results. The aim of  this study is to conduct a meta-analysis of studies that have examined the  association between exposure to CM and the subsequent parenting outcomes of  mothers of 0- to 6-year-old children. A secondary aim is to examine the  potential impact of both conceptual and methodological moderators. A total of 32  studies (27 samples, 41 effect sizes, 17,932 participants) were retained for  analysis. Results revealed that there is a small but statistically significant  association between maternal exposure to CM and parenting behavior (r = -.13, p  &lt; .05). Moderator analyses revealed that effect sizes were larger when  parenting measures involved relationship-based or negative, potentially abusive  behaviors, when samples had a greater number of boys compared to girls, and when  studies were older versus more recent. Results are discussed as they relate to  the intergenerational transmission of maltreatment and abuse.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418001542 PMID: 30757988 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Callous-unemotional traits and reduced default mode network connectivity within  a community sample of children.	Umbach RH(1), Tottenham N(1).	Author information: (1)Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.	Callous-unemotional (CU) traits characterize a subset of youth at risk for  persistent and serious antisocial behavior. Differences in resting state  connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) have been associated with CU  traits in forensic and clinical samples of adolescents and with deficient  interpersonal/affective traits (often operationalized as Factor 1 psychopathy  traits) in adults. It is unclear whether these brain-behavior associations  extend to community-based children. Using mixed model analyses, we tested the  associations between CU traits and within-network resting-state connectivity of  seven task-activated networks and the DMN using data from 9,636 9-11-year-olds  in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Even after  accounting for comorbid externalizing problems, higher levels of CU traits were  associated with reduced connectivity within the DMN. This finding is consistent  with prior literature surrounding psychopathy and CU traits in clinically and  forensically based populations, suggesting the correlation likely exists on a  spectrum, can be detected in childhood, and is not restricted to children with  significant antisocial behavior.

Aberrant face emotion processing has been demonstrated in youth with and at a  familial risk for bipolar and major depressive disorders. However, the  neurobiological factors related to emotion processing that underlie resilience  from youth-onset mood disorders are not well understood. Functional magnetic  resonance imaging data during an implicit emotion processing task were collected  at baseline from a sample of 50 youth, ages 8-17, who were healthy but also  familially at high risk for either bipolar disorder or major depressive  disorder, and 24 healthy controls with no family history of psychopathology  (HCL). Participants were reevaluated 3 years later and classified into three  groups for analysis: high-risk youth who converted to a psychiatric diagnosis  (CVT; N = 23), high-risk youth who were resilient from developing any  psychopathology (RES; N = 27), and HCL youth (N = 24) who remained healthy at  follow-up. For happy &gt; calm faces, the CVT and RES groups had significantly  lower activation in the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL), while the RES group  had lower activation in the right supramarginal gyrus. For fear &gt; calm faces,  the RES group had lower activation in the right precuneus and inferior frontal  gyrus (IFG) compared to the CVT group. Connectivity analyses revealed the RES  group exhibited higher left IPL connectivity with visual cortical regions for  happy &gt; calm faces, and higher IFG connectivity with frontal, temporal, and  limbic regions for fear &gt; calm faces. These connectivities were correlated  with improvements in prosocial behaviors and global functioning. Our findings  suggest that differential activation and connectivity in the IPL, IFG, and  precuneus in response to emotional stimuli may represent distinct resilience and  risk markers for youth-onset mood disorders.

Author information: (1)Shriners Hospitals for Children - Chicago, 2211 N. Oak Park Avenue, Chicago,  IL60707, USA. (2)Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, USA.	The current study examines the immediate and short-term impact of daily exposure  to community violence on same-day and next-day levels of posttraumatic stress  symptomatology and various affective states (i.e., dysphoria, hostility, and  anxiety), in a sample of 268 African American adolescents living in urban,  low-income, high-violence neighborhoods (Mage = 11.65; 59% female). In addition,  the moderating role of affective state variability on this relationship was  examined. This study utilized experience sampling method and a daily sampling  approach, which contributes a more robust investigation of the short-term  effects of violence exposure in youth. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed  that community violence exposure was positively associated with same-day and  next-day symptoms of posttraumatic stress. Violence exposure also exhibited an  immediate effect on dysphoria, anxiety, and hostility levels. Youth variability  in dysphoria exacerbated the effect of violence exposure on concurrent or  next-day posttraumatic stress, dysphoria, and hostility. Moreover, variability  in anxiety and hostility exacerbated the experience of next-day hostility. The  clinical implications relating to these findings, such as the importance of  implementing screening for posttraumatic stress following exposure, the  incorporation of preventative treatments among those at risk of exposure, and  the targeting of emotion regulation in treatments with adolescents, are  discussed.

Developmental pathways from child maltreatment to adolescent suicide-related  behaviors: The internalizing and externalizing comorbidity hypothesis.	Duprey EB(1), Oshri A(2), Liu S(2).	Author information: (1)Center for the Study and Prevention of Suicide, Department of Psychiatry,  University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY. (2)The Youth Development Institute, Department of Human Development and Family  Science, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.	Child maltreatment is a robust risk factor for suicidal ideation and behaviors  during adolescence. Elevations in internalizing and externalizing symptomology  have been identified as two distinct developmental pathways linking child  maltreatment and adolescent risk for suicide. However, recent research suggests  that the co-occurrence of internalizing and externalizing symptomology may form  a distinct etiological pathway for adolescent risk behaviors. Using the  Longitudinal Studies on Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) sample (N = 1,314),  the present study employed a person-centered approach to identify patterns of  concurrent change in internalizing and externalizing psychopathology over five  time points from early childhood to adolescence in relation to previous  experiences of child maltreatment and subsequent suicidal ideation and  behaviors. Results indicated four distinct bivariate externalizing and  internalizing growth trajectories. Group membership in a heightened comorbid  internalizing and externalizing symptom trajectory mediated the association  between childhood abuse and adolescent suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviors.  These findings suggest that the concurrent development of externalizing and  internalizing symptoms in childhood and adolescence may constitute a unique  developmental trajectory that confers risk for suicide-related outcomes.

Differential physiological sensitivity to child compliance behaviors in abusing,  neglectful, and non-maltreating mothers.	Norman Wells J(1), Skowron EA(1), Scholtes CM(1), DeGarmo DS(1).	Author information: (1)University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA.	We examined time-ordered associations between children's compliance behavior and  maternal respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in a sample of 127 child-maltreating  (physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse) and 94 non-maltreating  mothers and their preschool-aged children. Child prosocial and aversive  compliance behaviors and maternal RSA were continuously collected during a joint  challenge task. Child behavior and mother RSA were longitudinally nested  within-person and subjected to multilevel modeling (MLM), with between-person  child maltreatment subtype and level of inconsistent parenting modeled as  moderators. Both child maltreatment type and inconsistent parenting moderated  the effects of child compliance on maternal RSA. Increases in children's  prosocial compliance behaviors led to decreasing RSA in physically abusive  mothers 30s later (i.e., increasing arousal), but predicted increases in  non-maltreating mothers' RSA (i.e., increasing calm). Inconsistent parenting  (vacillating between autonomy-support and strict control) also moderated the  effects of children's compliance behavior on maternal physiology, weakening the  effects of child prosocial compliance on subsequent maternal RSA. These findings  highlight variations in mothers' physiological sensitivity to their children's  prosocial behavior that may play a role in the development of coercive cycles,  and underscore the need to consider individual differences in parents'  physiological sensitivity to their children to effectively tailor interventions  across the spectrum of risk.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with self-harm  during adolescence and young adulthood, especially among females. Yet little is  known about the developmental trajectories or childhood predictors/moderators of  self-harm in women with and without childhood histories of ADHD. We  characterized lifetime risk for nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), suicidal  ideation (SI), and suicide attempts (SA), comparing female participants with (n  = 140) and without (n = 88) childhood ADHD. We examined theory-informed  childhood predictors and moderators of lifetime risk via baseline measures from  childhood. First, regarding developmental patterns, most females with positive  histories of lifetime self-harm engaged in such behaviors in adolescence yet  desisted by adulthood. Females with positive histories of self-harm by late  adolescence emanated largely from the ADHD-C group. Second, we found that  predictors of NSSI were early externalizing symptoms, overall executive  functioning, and father's negative parenting; predictors of SI were adverse  childhood experiences and low self-esteem; and predictors of SA were early  externalizing symptoms, adverse childhood experiences, and low self-esteem.  Third, receiver operating characteristics analyses helped to ascertain  interactive sets of predictors. Findings indicate that pathways to self-harm are  multifaceted for females with ADHD. Understanding early childhood predictors and  moderators of self-harm can inform both risk assessment and intervention  strategies.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000553 PMID: 32536361

To advance research from Dishion and others on associations between parenting  and peer problems across childhood, we used a sample of 177 sibling pairs reared  apart since birth (because of adoption of one of the siblings) to examine  associations between parental hostility and children's peer problems when  children were ages 7 and 9.5 years (n = 329 children). We extended conventional  cross-lagged parent-peer models by incorporating child inhibitory control as an  additional predictor and examining genetic contributions via birth mother  psychopathology. Path models indicated a cross-lagged association from parental  hostility to later peer problems. When child inhibitory control was included,  birth mother internalizing symptoms were associated with poorer child inhibitory  control, which was associated with more parental hostility and peer problems.  The cross-lagged paths from parental hostility to peer problems were no longer  significant in the full model. Multigroup analyses revealed that the path from  birth mother internalizing symptoms to child inhibitory control was  significantly higher for birth parent-reared children, indicating the possible  contribution of passive gene-environment correlation to this association.  Exploratory analyses suggested that each child's unique rearing context  contributed to his or her inhibitory control and peer behavior.

Thibodeau EL(1), Masyn KE(2), Rogosch FA(3), Cicchetti D(1).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota. (2)Georgia State University. (3)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester.	This study used a structural equation mixture model to examine associations  between child maltreatment, polygenic risk, and indices of adaptive functioning.  Children aged 6 to 13 years (N = 1,004), half maltreated, half nonmaltreated,  were recruited to attend a research day camp. Multi-informant indicators of  prosocial behavior, antisocial behavior, withdrawn behavior, and depression were  collected and used in a latent class analysis. Four classes emerged,  characterizing "well-adjusted," "externalizing," "internalizing," and "socially  dominant" groups. Twelve genetic variants, previously reported in the Gene ×  Environment literature, were modeled as one weighted polygenic risk score. Large  main effects between maltreatment and adaptive functioning were observed (Wald =  35.3, df = 3, p &lt; .0001), along with evidence of a small Gene × Environment  effect (Wald = 13.5, df = 3, p = .004), adjusting for sex, age, and covariate  interaction effects.

Adverse effects of early exposure to parental mood disturbance on child  adjustment have been documented for both mothers and fathers, but are rarely  examined in tandem. Other under-researched questions include effects of changes  over time in parental well-being, similarities and contrasts between effects of  parental mood disturbance on children's internalizing versus externalizing  problems, and potential mediating effects of couple relationship quality. The  current study involved 438 couples who reported symptoms of depression and  anxiety at each of four time points (i.e., last trimester of pregnancy and 4,  14, and 24 months postbirth). Mothers and fathers also rated their couple  relationship quality and their child's socioemotional adjustment at 14 months,  as well as internalizing and externalizing problems at 24 months. Latent growth  models indicated direct effects of (a) maternal prenatal well-being on  externalizing problems at 24 months, and (b) paternal prenatal well-being on  socioemotional problems at 14 months. Internalizing symptoms at 24 months showed  only indirect associations with parental well-being, with couple relationship  quality playing a mediating role. Our findings highlight the importance of  prenatal exposure to parental mood disturbance and demonstrate that, even in a  low-risk sample, poor couple relationship quality explains the intergenerational  stability of internalizing problems.

The Young Adolescent Project (YAP) is an ongoing longitudinal study  investigating the effects of abuse and neglect on adolescent development. It is  a multidisciplinary study guided by a developmental, ecological perspective, and  designed to consider the physical, social, and psychological effects of  childhood maltreatment through the transition from childhood to adolescence.  Four waves of data collection have been completed, ranging from early (Mean age  = 10.95) to late adolescence (Mean age = 18.24). Members of the maltreated group  (n = 303) were selected from new cases that had been opened by the Department of  Child and Family Services, whereas the comparison group (n = 151) were not  involved with child welfare but lived in the same neighborhoods as the  maltreated group. The study assessed a wide variety of domains including  physical development (e.g., height, weight, body mass, pubertal development);  physiological reactivity (e.g., cortisol); cognitive abilities; mental health  (e.g., symptoms of depression, anxiety, trauma, and aggression); risk behavior  (e.g., sexual activity, delinquency, or substance use); social development  (e.g., self-esteem, competence, and social support); family environment; and  exposure to community violence. Overall, our findings demonstrated the pervasive  and persistent adverse effects of child maltreatment both within and across  domains, but they also identified maltreated youth with positive functioning.  Our hope is that this work will help move us toward identifying targets for  intervention to cultivate resilience and positive adaptation after early  maltreatment experiences.

Building on prior work using Tom Dishion's Family Check-Up, the current article  examined intervention effects on dysregulated irritability in early childhood.  Dysregulated irritability, defined as reactive and intense response to  frustration, and prolonged angry mood, is an ideal marker of neurodevelopmental  vulnerability to later psychopathology because it is a transdiagnostic indicator  of decrements in self-regulation that are measurable in the first years of life  that have lifelong implications for health and disease. This study is perhaps  the first randomized trial to examine the direct effects of an evidence- and  family-based intervention, the Family Check-Up (FCU), on irritability in early  childhood and the effects of reductions in irritability on later risk of child  internalizing and externalizing symptomatology. Data from the geographically and  sociodemographically diverse multisite Early Steps randomized prevention trial  were used. Path modeling revealed intervention effects on irritability at age 4,  which predicted lower externalizing and internalizing symptoms at age 10.5.  Results indicate that family-based programs initiated in early childhood can  reduce early childhood irritability and later risk for psychopathology. This  holds promise for earlier identification and prevention approaches that target  transdiagnostic pathways. Implications for future basic and prevention research  are discussed.

This study examined effects of risk factors in multiple domains measured in  preschool and kindergarten on age 6 depression symptoms, and on changes in  symptom levels between ages 4 and 6. Two models were examined in a large,  diverse (N = 796) community sample of children and parents. Risk variables  included SES, stress, conflict, parental depression, parental hostility,  support, scaffolding, child negative affect (NA), effortful control (EC),  sensory regulation (SR), and attachment security. Model 1 included effects of  risk factors at ages 4 and 5 on child depression symptoms at age 6. Model 2 also  included depression symptoms at all three ages to examine changes in these  symptoms. Model 1 revealed that age 4 and 5 parental depression, NA, EC, and SR  predicted age 6 child depression levels, Several age 4 variables had indirect  pathways to age 6 depression via age 5 EC. Model 2 revealed that preschool  depression was the only age 4 variable, and EC and SR were the only age 5  variables that significantly predicted increases in age 6 depression. These  findings highlight the role of self-regulation in child depression and suggest  that targeting self-regulation may be an effective prevention and intervention  strategy.

Greater psychosocial risk in childhood and adolescence predicts poorer  cardiometabolic outcomes in adulthood. We assessed whether the timing of  psychosocial risk from infancy through adolescence predicts cardiometabolic  outcomes in young adulthood. Young adults and their mothers participated in a  longitudinal study beginning in infancy in Santiago, Chile (N = 1040). At  infancy, 5 years, 10 years, and adolescence, mothers reported on depressive  symptoms, stressful experiences, support for child development in the home,  father absence, parental education, and socioeconomic status (SES) to create a  psychosocial risk composite at each time point. Young adults (52.1% female;  21-27 years) provided fasting serum samples and participated in anthropometric  and blood pressure (BP) assessments, including a dual-energy X-ray  absorptiometry (DXA) scan for measuring body fat. Greater infant psychosocial  risk was associated with a greater young adult metabolic syndrome score (β =  0.07, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.01 to 0.13, p = 0.02), a higher body mass  index and waist circumference composite (β = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.13, p =  0.002), and a higher body fat (DXA) composite (β = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.12, p  = 0.02). No psychosocial risk measure from any time point was associated with  BP. Infant psychosocial risk predicted cardiometabolic outcomes in young  adulthood better than psychosocial risk at 5 years, 10 years, or adolescence,  mean of psychosocial risk from infancy through adolescence, and maximum of  psychosocial risk at any one time. Consistent with the Developmental Origins of  Health and Disease model, findings suggest that infancy is a sensitive period  for psychosocial risk leading to poorer cardiometabolic outcomes in young  adulthood.

(4)College of Family,Home, and Social Sciences,Brigham Young University,Provo,  UT,USA.	Bullying has been understudied among preschool children, especially those from  Chinese American families. Previous research has also neglected the dimensional  effects of psychological control on child bullying development. This study  examined two psychological control dimensions, love withdrawal and guilt  induction, and their effects on children's bullying aggressive behavior using a  longitudinal design. Participants were first-generation Chinese American mothers  (N = 133; mean age [Mage] = 37.82) and their preschool children (Mage = 4.48).  Chinese immigrant mothers reported their psychologically controlling parenting  and teachers rated children's bullying aggressive behaviors in the school  setting. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to establish the  psychometric properties and cross-wave measurement equivalence of the study  constructs. Cross-lagged structural equation modeling analysis indicated that  maternal love withdrawal prospectively predicted more bullying aggressive  behavior, whereas guilt induction predicted less bullying aggressive behavior in  children 6 months later. These results held after controlling for the initial  level of children's problem behaviors and demographic variables (child age,  gender, and maternal education). For child effects, child bullying aggressive  behavior predicted more maternal guilt induction over time but not love  withdrawal. Our findings highlight the importance of construct specificity and  cultural context in understanding associations between parenting and child  development.

(2)Prevention Research Center, Pennsylvania State University, University Park,  PA, USA.	This study revisits the premature autonomy model by examining parents' use of  positive behavior support (PBS) practices on a daily timescale to better  understand underlying processes in developmental changes in family disengagement  and the implications for adolescent problem behavior and substance use. This  study included 151 9th and 10th grade adolescents (61.5% female) and their  caregivers, who participated in a baseline assessment, a 21-day daily diary  burst, and a 1-year follow-up assessment. Four key findings emerged: (a) on days  when parents used more PBS, adolescents felt more close and connected to their  caregivers; (b) adolescents who exhibited a larger-magnitude of change in  connectedness with caregivers in relation to variation in positive parenting  (termed fragile connectedness) were at higher risk for antisocial behavior,  deviant peer involvement, and substance use one year later; (c) individual  differences in initial levels of antisocial behavior and effortful control  accounted for between-person variation in fragile connectedness; and (d)  day-level adolescent anger and parent-adolescent conflict predicted  within-family variation in parents' use of PBS. Implications for the premature  autonomy model and intervention science are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001032 PMID: 31455441 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Anxiety disorders are common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and associated  with social-communication impairment and repetitive behavior symptoms. The  neurobiology of anxiety in ASD is unknown, but amygdala dysfunction has been  implicated in both ASD and anxiety disorders. Using resting-state functional  magnetic resonance imaging, we compared amygdala-prefrontal and  amygdala-striatal connections across three demographically matched groups  studied in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE): ASD with a comorbid  anxiety disorder (N = 25; ASD + Anxiety), ASD without a comorbid disorder (N =  68; ASD-NoAnx), and typically developing controls (N = 139; TD). Relative to  ASD-NoAnx and TD controls, ASD + Anxiety individuals had decreased connectivity  between the amygdala and dorsal/rostral anterior cingulate cortex (dACC/rACC).  The functional connectivity of these connections was not affected in ASD-NoAnx,  and amygdala connectivity with ventral ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)  circuits was not different in ASD + Anxiety or ASD-NoAnx relative to TD.  Decreased amygdala-dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)/rACC connectivity was  associated with more severe social impairment in ASD + Anxiety;  amygdala-striatal connectivity was associated with restricted, repetitive  behavior (RRB) symptom severity in ASD-NoAnx individuals. These findings suggest  comorbid anxiety in ASD is associated with disrupted emotion-monitoring  processes supported by amygdala-dACC/mPFC pathways, whereas emotion regulation  systems involving amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) are relatively  spared. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for comorbid anxiety  for parsing ASD neurobiological heterogeneity.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000772 PMID: 33161905 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Environmental and biological factors contribute to sleep development during  infancy. Parenting plays a particularly important role in modulating infant  sleep, potentially via the serotonin system, which is itself involved in  regulating infant sleep. We hypothesized that maternal neglect and serotonin  system dysregulation would be associated with daytime sleep in infant rhesus  monkeys. Subjects were nursery-reared infant rhesus macaques (n = 287). During  the first month of life, daytime sleep-wake states were rated bihourly  (0800-2100). Infants were considered neglected (n = 16) if before  nursery-rearing, their mother repeatedly failed to retrieve them. Serotonin  transporter genotype and concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid  5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were used as markers of central serotonin  system functioning. t tests showed that neglected infants were observed sleeping  less frequently, weighed less, and had higher 5-HIAA than non-neglected  nursery-reared infants. Regression revealed that serotonin transporter genotype  moderated the relationship between 5-HIAA and daytime sleep: in subjects  possessing the Ls genotype, there was a positive correlation between 5-HIAA and  daytime sleep, whereas in subjects possessing the LL genotype there was no  association. These results highlight the pivotal roles that parents and the  serotonin system play in sleep development. Daytime sleep alterations observed  in neglected infants may partially derive from serotonin system dysregulation.

Identifying developmental endophenotypes on the pathway between genetics and  behavior is critical to uncovering the mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental  conditions. In this proof-of-principle study, we explored whether early  disruptions in visual attention are a unique or shared candidate endophenotype  of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD). We calculated the duration of the longest look (i.e., peak look) to  faces in an array-based eye-tracking task for 335 14-month-old infants with and  without first-degree relatives with ASD and/or ADHD. We leveraged parent-report  and genotype data available for a proportion of these infants to evaluate the  relation of looking behavior to familial (n = 285) and genetic liability (using  polygenic scores, n = 185) as well as ASD and ADHD-relevant temperament traits  at 2 years of age (shyness and inhibitory control, respectively, n = 272) and  ASD and ADHD clinical traits at 6 years of age (n = 94).Results showed that  longer peak looks at the face were associated with elevated polygenic scores for  ADHD (β = 0.078, p = .023), but not ASD (β = 0.002, p = .944), and with elevated  ADHD traits in mid-childhood (F(1,88) = 6.401, p = .013, $\eta _p^2$=0.068; ASD:  F (1,88) = 3.218, p = .076), but not in toddlerhood (ps > 0.2). This pattern of  results did not emerge when considering mean peak look duration across face and  nonface stimuli. Thus, alterations in attention to faces during spontaneous  visual exploration may be more consistent with a developmental endophenotype of  ADHD than ASD. Our work shows that dissecting paths to neurodevelopmental  conditions requires longitudinal data incorporating polygenic contribution,  early neurocognitive function, and clinical phenotypic variation.

Maternal alcohol dependence and harsh caregiving across parenting contexts: The  moderating role of child negative emotionality.	Jacques DT(1), Sturge-Apple ML(1), Davies PT(1), Cicchetti D(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA. (2)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN,  USA.	Parental alcohol dependence is a significant risk factor for harsh caregiving  behaviors; however, it is unknown whether and how harsh caregiving changes over  time and across parenting contexts for alcohol-dependent mothers. Furthermore,  to our knowledge, no studies have examined whether and how distinct dimensions  of child characteristics, such as negative emotionality modulate harsh  caregiving among alcohol-dependent mothers. Guided by parenting process models,  the present study examined how two distinct domains of children's negative  emotionality-fear and frustration-moderate the association between maternal  alcohol dependence and maternal harshness across discipline and free-play  contexts. A high-risk sample of 201 mothers and their two-year-old children were  studied over a one-year period. Results from latent difference score analyses  indicated that harsh parenting among alcohol-dependent mothers increased over  time in the more stressful discipline context, but not in the parent-child play  context. This effect was maintained even after controlling for other parenting  risk factors, including other forms of maternal psychopathology. Furthermore,  this increase in harsh parenting was specific to alcohol-dependent mothers whose  children were displaying high levels of anger and frustration. Findings provide  support for specificity in conceptualizations of child negative emotionality and  parenting contexts as potential determinants of maladaptive caregiving among  alcohol-dependent mothers.

Romantic functioning mediates prospective associations between childhood abuse  and neglect and parenting outcomes in adulthood.	Labella MH(1), Raby KL(2), Martin J(3), Roisman GI(1).	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development,University of Minnesota. (2)Department of Psychology,University of Utah. (3)Department of Psychology,York University.	Research suggests intergenerational links between childhood abuse and neglect  and subsequent parenting quality, but little is known about the potential  mechanisms underlying intergenerational continuities in parenting. Adult  romantic functioning may be one plausible mechanism, given its documented  associations with both adverse caregiving in childhood and parenting quality in  adulthood. The present study used data from the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of  Risk and Adaptation to (a) investigate prospective associations between  childhood experiences of abuse and neglect and multiple parenting outcomes in  adulthood, and (b) evaluate the degree to which adult romantic functioning  mediates those associations. Information regarding childhood abuse and neglect  was gathered prospectively from birth through age 17.5 years. Multimethod  assessments of romantic functioning were collected repeatedly through early  adulthood (ages 20 to 32 years), and parenting quality was assessed as  participants assumed a parenting role (ages 21 to 38 years). As expected,  childhood abuse and neglect experiences predicted less supportive parenting  (observed and interview rated) and higher likelihood of self-reported Child  Protective Services involvement. The association with interview-rated supportive  parenting was partially mediated by lower romantic competence, whereas the  association with Child Protective Services involvement was partially mediated by  more relational violence in adult romantic relationships. Implications of these  novel prospective findings for research and clinical intervention are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941800158X PMID: 30757989 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Trait neuroticism and emotion neurocircuitry: Functional magnetic resonance  imaging evidence for a failure in emotion regulation.

(4)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota,Twin  Cities,Minneapolis,MN,USA.	Though theory suggests that individual differences in neuroticism (a tendency to  experience negative emotions) would be associated with altered functioning of  the amygdala (which has been linked with emotionality and emotion dysregulation  in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood), results of functional neuroimaging  studies have been contradictory and inconclusive. We aimed to clarify the  relationship between neuroticism and three hypothesized neural markers derived  from functional magnetic resonance imaging during negative emotion face  processing: amygdala activation, amygdala habituation, and amygdala-prefrontal  connectivity, each of which plays an important role in the experience and  regulation of emotions. We used general linear models to examine the  relationship between trait neuroticism and the hypothesized neural markers in a  large sample of over 500 young adults. Although neuroticism was not  significantly associated with magnitude of amygdala activation or amygdala  habituation, it was associated with amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex  connectivity, which has been implicated in emotion regulation. Results suggest  that trait neuroticism may represent a failure in top-down control and  regulation of emotional reactions, rather than overactive emotion generation  processes, per se. These findings suggest that neuroticism, which has been  associated with increased rates of transdiagnostic psychopathology, may  represent a failure in the inhibitory neurocircuitry associated with emotion  regulation.

Caregiver-adolescent co-reminiscing and adolescents' individual recollections of  a devastating tornado: Associations with enduring posttraumatic stress symptoms.	Hendrickson ML(1), Abel MR(2), Vernberg EM(2), McDonald KL(3), Lochman JE(3).	Author information: (1)Jackson Behavioral Health Hospital, Miami, FL, USA. (2)University of Kansas, Clinical Child Psychology Program, Lawrence, KS, USA. (3)University of Alabama, Department of Psychology, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA.	Although disaster-related posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) typically  decrease in intensity over time, some youth continue to report elevated levels  of PTSS many years after the disaster. The current study examines two processes  that may help to explain the link between disaster exposure and enduring PTSS:  caregiver emotion socialization and youth recollection qualities. One hundred  and twenty-two youth (ages 12 to 17) and their female caregivers who experienced  an EF-4 tornado co-reminisced about the event, and adolescents provided  independent recollections between 3 and 4 years after the tornado. Adolescent  individual transcripts were coded for coherence and negative personal impact,  qualities that have been found to contribute to meaning making.  Parent-adolescent conversations were coded for caregiver egocentrism, a  construct derived from the emotion socialization literature to reflect the  extent to which the caregiver centered the conversation on her own emotions and  experiences. Egocentrism predicted higher youth PTSS, and this association was  mediated by the coherence of adolescents' narratives. The association between  coherence and PTSS was stronger for youth who focused more on the negative  personal impacts of the tornado event during their recollections. Results  suggest that enduring tornado-related PTSS may be influenced in part by the  interplay of caregiver emotion socialization practices and youth recollection  qualities.

The role of relational support in the longitudinal links between adolescent  sexual harassment victimization and psychological health.	Skoog T(1), Kapetanovic S(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden. (2)University West, Trollhattan, Sweden.	The links between sexual harassment victimization and aspects of psychopathology  are well-established in adolescent research, but whether sexual harassment  victimization undermines positive aspects of psychological health and the  moderating role of relational support in the link between sexual harassment  victimization and psychological ill-health remains unknown. Using a cross-lagged  model, we examined (a) the bidirectional and longitudinal links between sexual  harassment victimization and adolescent psychological health (emotional problems  and well-being) and (b) the moderating role of relational support from parents,  teachers, and peers (best friends and classmates) in the link between sexual  harassment victimization and adolescent psychological health. We used two waves  of self-reported data (separated by 1 year) from 676 Swedish adolescents (50%  female; mean age = 13.85 years at the point of first data collection).  Controlling for the effects of gender and subjective socioeconomic status, the  cross-lagged model revealed that sexual harassment predicted emotional problems  positively and well-being negatively. Moreover, well-being predicted sexual  harassment negatively. Relational support from classmates moderated the link in  the direction from sexual harassment victimization to emotional problems.  Relational support did not moderate the link to well-being. The findings provide  new and important insights into the role of sexual harassment victimization in  adolescent psychological adjustment and potential approaches to intervention.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA. (2)Wyman Center, St. Louis, MO, USA.	This study evaluated a school-based intervention to enhance adolescent peer  relationships and improve functional outcomes, building upon Ed Zigler's seminal  contribution in recognizing the potential of academic contexts to enhance social  and emotional development. Adolescents (N = 610) primarily from economically or  racially/ethnically marginalized groups were assessed preintervention,  postintervention, and at 4-month follow-up in a randomized controlled trial. At  program completion, intervention participants reported significantly increased  quality of peer relationships; by 4-month follow-up, this increased quality was  also observable by peers outside of the program, and program participants also  displayed higher levels of academic engagement and lower levels of depressive  symptoms. These latter effects appear to have potentially been mediated via  participants' increased use of social support. The potential of the Connection  Project intervention specifically, and of broader efforts to activate adolescent  peer relationships as potent sources of social support and growth more generally  within the secondary school context, is discussed.

Psychosocial stress in childhood and adolescence is linked to stress system  dysregulation, although few studies have examined the relative impacts of  parental harshness and parental disengagement. This study prospectively tested  whether parental harshness and disengagement show differential associations with  overall cortisol output in adolescence. Associations between overall cortisol  output and adolescent mental health problems were tested concurrently.  Adolescents from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) provided  hair samples for cortisol assay at 15 years (N = 171). Caregivers reported on  parental harshness and disengagement experiences at 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15 years,  and adolescents reported at 15 years. Both parent and adolescent reported  depressive and anxiety symptoms and antisocial behaviors at 15. Greater parental  harshness from 1-15 years, and harshness reported at 15 years in particular, was  associated with higher overall cortisol output at 15. Greater parental  disengagement from 1-15 years, and disengagement at 1 year specifically, was  associated with lower cortisol output. There were no significant associations  between cortisol output and depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or antisocial  behaviors. These results suggest that the unique variances of parental harshness  and disengagement may have opposing associations with cortisol output at 15  years, with unclear implications for adolescent mental health.

Individual differences in temperament have been well-described, but individual  differences in temperament trajectories require elaboration. Specifically, it is  unknown if subgroups of infants display different developmental patterns and if  these patterns relate to later behavioral problems. The aims were to identify  distinct developmental patterns in broad dimensions of temperament among  typically developing infants, to determine whether these developmental patterns  differ by sex, to evaluate how developmental patterns within each dimension of  temperament relate to developmental patterns within other dimensions of  temperament, and to determine whether developmental patterns of infant  temperament are associated with internalizing and externalizing behavior at 2  years of age. Data from the longitudinal Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and  Nutrition study (n = 1,819) were used to model latent class trajectories of  parent-reported infant temperament at 3, 6, and 12 months. Four to five unique  latent trajectories were identified within each temperament dimension. Sex was  not associated with trajectory groups. Developmental coordination was observed  between trajectories of negative emotionality and regulatory capacity, and  between regulatory capacity and positive affect, but not between positive affect  and negative emotionality. Negative emotionality and regulatory capacity  predicted internalizing and externalizing behavior. Patterns of development in  infant temperament, and not just intensity of temperament, contribute toward  later problem behavior.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000991 PMID: 32938514

Author information: (1)Department of Sociology and Interuniversity Center for Social Science Theory  and Methodology, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.

Relationships with parents and peers are crucial for children's socialization,  but how parent-child and peer relationships mutually affect each other is not  well understood. Guided by spillover theory, we zoomed in on the bidirectional  interplay between parental rejection and warmth on the one hand and peer  victimization on the other, and examined whether children's maladjustment  symptoms mediated hypothesized cross-domain spillover effects. Data stem from  five waves of the longitudinal KiVa study among 9,770 children (50% boys; mean  age = 9.16, standard deviation = 1.29). Results from random intercept  cross-lagged panel models showed that higher parental rejection and lower  parental warmth predicted increases in peer victimization and vice versa across  waves, thus supporting the bidirectional model. Moreover, spillover from  parent-child rejection and warmth to peer victimization was partially driven by  children's depressive symptoms and bullying perpetration. Vice versa, spillover  from peer victimization to parent-child rejection and warmth was partially  driven by children's social anxiety, depressive symptoms, conduct problems, and  bullying perpetration. Thus, children might get caught in persistent problems in  two important social domains, and these two domains influence each other through  children's maladjustment. Family and school interventions should be integrated  to prevent a downwards spiral.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418001360 PMID: 30642413 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Adolescence is a period of heightened susceptibility to peer influences, and  deviant peer affiliation has well-established implications for the development  of psychopathology. However, little is known about the role of brain functions  in pathways connecting peer contexts and health risk behaviors. We tested  developmental cascade models to evaluate contributions of adolescent risk  taking, peer influences, and neurobehavioral variables of risk processing and  cognitive control to substance use among 167 adolescents who were assessed  annually for four years. Risk taking at Time 1 was related to substance use at  Time 4 indirectly through peer substance use at Time 2 and insular activation  during risk processing at Time 3. Furthermore, neural cognitive control  moderated these effects. Greater insular activation during risk processing was  related to higher substance use for those with greater medial prefrontal cortex  activation during cognitive control, but it was related to lower substance use  among those with lower medial prefrontal cortex activation during cognitive  control. Neural processes related to risk processing and cognitive control play  a crucial role in the processes linking risk taking, peer substance use, and  adolescents' own substance use.

Early institutional rearing is associated with increased risk for subsequent  peer relationship difficulties, but the underlying mechanisms have not been  identified. Friendship characteristics, social behaviors with peers, normed  assessments of social problems, and social cue use were assessed in 142 children  (mean age = 10.06, SD = 2.02; range 7-13 years), of whom 67 were previously  institutionalized (PI), and 75 were raised by their biological families. Anxiety  and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, often elevated  among PI children, were examined as potential mediators of PI status and  baseline social functioning and longitudinal follow-ups (2 and 4 years later).  Twenty-seven percent of PI children fell above the Child Behavior Checklist  Social Problems cutoff. An examination of specific social behaviors with peers  indicated that PI and comparison children did not differ in empathic concern or  peer social approach, though parents were more likely to endorse  aggression/overarousal as a reason that PI children might struggle with  friendships. Comparison children outperformed PI children in computerized  testing of social cue use learning. Finally, across these measures, social  difficulties exhibited in the PI group were mediated by ADHD symptoms with  predicted social problems assessed 4 years later. These findings show that, when  PI children struggle with friendships, mechanisms involving attention and  behavior regulation are likely contributors.

Self-inflicted injury (SII) in adolescence is a serious public health concern  that portends prospective vulnerability to internalizing and externalizing  psychopathology, borderline personality development, suicide attempts, and  suicide. To date, however, our understanding of neurobiological vulnerabilities  to SII is limited. Behaviorally, affect dysregulation is common among those who  self-injure. This suggests ineffective cortical modulation of emotion, as  observed among adults with borderline personality disorder. In borderline  samples, structural and functional abnormalities are observed in several frontal  regions that subserve emotion regulation (e.g., anterior cingulate, insula,  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). However, no volumetric analyses of cortical  brain regions have been conducted among self-injuring adolescents. We used  voxel-based morphometry to compare cortical gray matter volumes between  self-injuring adolescent girls, ages 13-19 years (n = 20), and controls (n =  20). Whole-brain analyses revealed reduced gray matter volumes among  self-injurers in the insular cortex bilaterally, and in the right inferior  frontal gyrus, an adjacent neural structure also implicated in emotion and  self-regulation. Insular and inferior frontal gyrus gray matter volumes  correlated inversely with self-reported emotion dysregulation, over-and-above  effects of psychopathology. Findings are consistent with an emotion  dysregulation construal of SII, and indicate structural abnormalities in some  but not all cortical brain regions implicated in borderline personality disorder  among adults.

(4)Department of Psychology, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.	Exposure to adverse events is prevalent among youths and robustly associated  with risk for depression, particularly during adolescence. The Dimensional Model  of Adversity and Psychopathology (DMAP) distinguishes between adverse events  that expose youths to deprivation versus threat, positing unique mechanisms of  risk (cognitive functioning deficits for deprivation, and altered fear and  emotion learning for threat) that may require different approaches to  intervention. We examined whether deprivation and threat were distinctly  associated with behavioral measures of cognitive processes and autonomic nervous  system function in relation to depression symptom severity in a community sample  of early adolescents (n = 117; mean age 12.73 years; 54.7% male). Consistent  with DMAP, associations between threat and depression symptoms, and between  economic deprivation and depression symptoms, were distinctly moderated by  physiological and cognitive functions, respectively, at baseline but not  follow-up. Under conditions of greater cognitive inhibition, less exposure to  deprivation was associated with lower symptom severity. Under conditions of  blunted resting-state autonomic response (electrodermal activity and respiratory  sinus arrhythmia), greater exposure to threat was associated with higher symptom  severity. Our findings support the view that understanding risk for youth  depression requires parsing adversity: examining distinct roles played by  deprivation and threat, and the associated cognitive and biological processes.

Individual differences in social-emotional functioning emerge early and have  long-term implications for developmental adaptation and competency. Research is  needed that specifies multiple early risk factors and outcomes simultaneously to  demonstrate specificity. Using multigroup longitudinal path analysis in a sample  of typically developing children (N = 541), we examined child temperament  dimensions (surgency, negative affectivity, and regulation/effortful control)  and maternal anxiety in infancy and age 2 as predictors of child externalizing,  internalizing, dysregulation, and competence behaviors at age 3. Four primary  patterns emerged. First, there was stability in temperament dimensions and  maternal anxiety from infancy to age 3. Second, negative affectivity was  implicated in internalizing problems and surgency in externalizing problems.  Third, effortful control at age 2 was a potent mediator of maternal anxiety in  infancy on age 3 outcomes. Fourth, there was suggestive evidence for  transactional effects between maternal anxiety and child effortful control. Most  pathways operated similarly for boys and girls, with some differences,  particularly for surgency. These findings expand our understanding of the roles  of specific temperamental domains and postnatal maternal anxiety in a range of  social-emotional outcomes in the preschool period, and have implications for  efforts to enhance the development of young children's social-emotional  functioning and reduce risk for later psychopathology.

Childhood adversity (CA) increases the risk of subsequent mental health  problems. Adolescent social support (from family and/or friends) reduces the  risk of mental health problems after CA. However, the mechanisms of this effect  remain unclear, and we speculate that they are manifested on neurodevelopmental  levels. Therefore, we investigated whether family and/or friendship support at  ages 14 and 17 function as intermediate variables for the relationship between  CA before age 11 and affective or neural responses to social rejection feedback  at age 18. We studied 55 adolescents with normative mental health at age 18 (26  with CA and therefore considered "resilient"), from a longitudinal cohort.  Participants underwent a Social Feedback Task in the magnetic resonance imaging  scanner. Social rejection feedback activated the dorsal anterior cingulate  cortex and the left anterior insula. CA did not predict affective or neural  responses to social rejection at age 18. Yet, CA predicted better friendships at  age 14 and age 18, when adolescents with and without CA had comparable mood  levels. Thus, adolescents with CA and normative mood levels have more adolescent  friendship support and seem to have normal mood and neural responses to social  rejection.

Author information: (1)University of California,Irvine.	Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is distributed throughout the brain and in  peripheral sites but primarily is localized in the paraventricular nucleus of  the hypothalamus. It is a "master" stress hormone that is responsible for the  synthesis of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the anterior pituitary gland.  Behaviorally active peptide hormones, including adrenocorticotropin hormone  (ACTH) and B-endorphin, are liberated from POMC by enzymes to activate critical  processes during stress. CRH is not detectable in the circulation even during  extreme stress. However, during human pregnancy, the human placenta expresses  the gene for CRH (pCRH) resulting in detectable levels in maternal plasma that  increases 20- to 40-fold over the course of gestation. Placental CRH is  identical to CRH of hypothalamic origin in size, structure, immunoreactivity,  and bioactivity. However, unlike the negative feedback between adrenal cortisol  and hypothalamic CRH, cortisol stimulates the synthesis and release of pCRH. The  bidirectional release of pCRH into maternal and fetal compartments is associated  with regulating the timing of delivery, remodeling the fetal nervous system, and  influencing developmental trajectories. Fetal exposure to pCRH during early and  late gestation is associated with unique patterns of cortical thinning in  school-age children. Placental CRH is elevated in response to physical and  behavioral stress and may be an integrative marker of early adversity.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418000664 PMID: 30068427 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Studies examining associations between fetal serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI)  exposure and child autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnoses or delayed language  remain mixed and rarely prospectively follow children or employ gold-standard  assessments. We prospectively followed a cohort of mother-child dyads from  pregnancy through early elementary school (N = 178), and obtained maternal and  alternate-caregiver ratings of behaviors related to ASD (N = 137), as well as  direct, gold-standard assessments of child ASD symptoms and pragmatic language  among dyads who experienced prenatal depression and either took SRIs or were  medication free during pregnancy (N = 44). Prenatal SRI exposure was related to  maternal ratings of ASD-related behaviors (β = 0.24 95% confidence interval; CI  [0.07, 0.48]), and, among boys, alternative caregiver ratings (males-only β =  0.28 95% CI [0.02, 0.55], females-only β = -0.21 95% CI [-0.63, 0.08]). However,  results of our direct assessments suggest an association between SRI exposure  and reduced pragmatic language scores (β = -0.27, 95% CI [-0.53, -0.01], but not  ASD (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule β = 0.14 95% CI [-0.15, 0.41];  Social Responsiveness Scale β = 0.08 95% CI [-0.25, 0.40]). These discrepancies  point to issues regarding how ASD is assessed, and the possibility that SRIs may  be more strongly associated with language or other broader behaviors that  coincide with ASD. Larger prospective studies that incorporate thorough,  gold-standard assessments of ASD, language, and other ASD-related behaviors are  needed.

Perry KJ(1), Meisel SN(1), Stotsky MT(1), Ostrov JM(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University at Buffalo, The State University of New  York, Buffalo, NY, USA.	The current study examined a bifactor model of affective dimensions of  withdrawal. Specifically, a model which specified a general factor of  anxious-avoidant withdrawal (i.e., withdrawal with negative affect), a specific  factor of unsociability (i.e., withdrawal without negative affect), and a  specific factor of negative affect without withdrawal was specified in the  primary sample (n = 238, 56.3% boys, M age = 44.92 months, SD = 5.32 months) and  a validation sample (n = 332, 52.6% boys, M age = 47.11 months, SD = 7.32  months). The model provided a good fit to the data in both samples. In the  primary sample, longitudinal relations between the bifactor model and peer  victimization were examined across three time points (Time 1 in the spring, Time  2 in the fall, and Time 3 in the spring). Results showed that negative affect  without withdrawal was concurrently associated with higher levels of relational  and physical victimization at T1, unsociability predicted reductions in  relational victimization from T1 to T2 as children entered a new classroom, and  anxious-avoidant withdrawal predicted reductions in relational and physical  victimization from T2 to T3 as children acclimated to the new classroom.  Developmental considerations and clinical implications are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000346 PMID: 32646528

Impaired cognitive functioning constitutes an important symptom of major  depressive disorder (MDD), potentially associated with elevated cortisol levels.  Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) enhance the risk for MDD and can contribute  to disturbances in the stress systems, including cortisol and cognitive  functions. In healthy participants, cortisol administration as well as acute  stress can affect cognitive performance. In the current study, we tested  cognitive performance in MDD patients with (N = 32) and without (N = 52) ACE and  healthy participants with (N = 22) and without (N = 37) ACE after psychosocial  stress induction (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) and a control condition  (Placebo-TSST). MDD predicted lower performance in verbal learning and both  selective and sustained attention, while ACE predicted lower performance in  psychomotoric speed and working memory. There were no interaction effects of MDD  and ACE. After stress, MDD patients were more likely to show lower performance  in working memory as well as in selective and sustained attention compared with  participants without MDD. Individuals with ACE were more likely to show lower  performance in verbal memory after stress compared with individuals without ACE.  Our results indicate negative effects of MDD and ACE on distinct cognitive  domains. Furthermore, MDD and/or ACE seem to enhance susceptibility for  stress-related cognitive impairments.

Differential brain activity as a function of social evaluative stress in early  adolescence: Brain function and salivary cortisol.	Herzberg MP(1), Hunt RH(1), Thomas KM(1), Gunnar MR(1).	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN,  USA.	Understanding individual differences in neural responses to stressful  environments is an important avenue of research throughout development. These  differences may be especially critical during adolescence, which is  characterized by opportunities for healthy development and increased  susceptibility to the development of psychopathology. While the neural  correlates of the psychosocial stress response have been investigated in adults,  these links have not been explored during development. Using a new task, the  Minnesota Imaging Stress Test in Children (MISTiC), differences in activation  are found in fusiform gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, insula, and anterior  cingulate cortex when comparing a stressful math task to a nonstressful math  task. The MISTiC task successfully elicits cortisol responses in a similar  proportion of adolescents as in behavioral studies while collecting brain  imaging data. Cortisol responders and nonresponders did not differ in their  perceived stress level or behavioral performance during the task despite  differences in neuroendocrine function. Future research will be able to leverage  the MISTiC task for many purposes, including probing associations between  individual differences in stress responses with environmental conditions,  personality differences, and the development of psychopathology.

(2)Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University,  Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. (3)Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.	Although child maltreatment is a major public health concern, which adversely  affects psychological and physical development, we know relatively little  concerning psychophysiological and personality factors that may modify risk in  children exposed to maltreatment. Using a three-wave, short-term prospective  design, we examined the influence of individual differences in two disparate  psychophysiological measures of risk (i.e., resting frontal brain electrical  activity and respiratory sinus arrhythmia) on the trajectories of extraversion  and neuroticism in a sample of female adolescents (N = 55; M age = 14.02 years)  exposed to child maltreatment. Adolescents exposed to child maltreatment with  relatively higher left frontal absolute alpha power (i.e., lower brain activity)  at rest exhibited increasing trajectories of extraversion, and adolescents  exposed to child maltreatment with relatively lower respiratory sinus arrhythmia  at rest displayed increasing trajectories of neuroticism over 1 year. Individual  differences in psychophysiological measures indexing resting central and  peripheral nervous system activity may therefore differentially influence  personality characteristics in adolescent females exposed to child maltreatment.

Mapping developmental changes in perceived parent-adolescent relationship  quality throughout middle school and high school.	Ebbert AM(1), Infurna FJ(1), Luthar SS(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University.	This study examined changes in adolescents' perceived relationship quality with  mothers and fathers from middle school to high school, gender differences, and  associated mental health consequences using longitudinal data from the New  England Study of Suburban Youth cohort (n = 262, 48% female) with annual  assessments (Grades 6-12). For both parents, alienation increased, and trust and  communication decreased from middle school to high school, with greater changes  among girls. Overall, closeness to mothers was higher than with fathers. Girls,  compared to boys, perceived more trust and communication and similar levels of  alienation with mothers at Grade 6. Girls perceived stronger increases in  alienation from both parents and stronger declines in trust with mothers during  middle school. Increasing alienation from both parents and less trust with  mothers at Grade 6 was associated with higher levels of anxiety at Grade 12.  Less trust with both parents at Grade 6 and increasing alienation and decreasing  trust with mothers in high school were associated with higher levels of  depressive symptoms at Grade 12. Overall, girls reported having higher levels of  anxiety at Grade 12 compared to boys. Findings on the course of the quality of  parent-adolescent relationships over time are discussed in terms of implications  for more targeted research and interventions.

Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) demonstrates efficacy in improving  parent and child outcomes, with preliminary evidence for effectiveness in  community settings. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness  of a community-based ABC implementation in improving parent outcomes as well as  to examine potential mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness. Two  hundred parents and their 5- to 21-month-old infants recruited from an urban  community were randomly assigned to receive ABC or be placed on a waitlist. The  majority of participants had a minority racial or ethnic background. Before  intervention, parents completed questionnaires about sociodemographic risk and  adverse childhood experiences. At both baseline and follow-up, parents reported  depression symptoms and were video-recorded interacting with their infant, which  was coded for sensitivity. The ABC intervention predicted significant increases  in parental sensitivity and, among parents who completed the intervention,  significant decreases in depression symptoms. Changes in parental depression  symptoms did not significantly mediate the intervention effects on sensitivity.  Risk variables did not moderate the intervention effects. The results indicate  that ABC shows promise for improving parent outcomes in community settings,  supporting dissemination.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000310 PMID: 32662374

A systematic review of caregiver-child physiological synchrony across systems:  Associations with behavior and child functioning.	DePasquale CE(1).	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN,  USA.	Extensive research has established a positive association between  caregiver-child behavioral synchrony and child developmental functioning.  Burgeoning research examining physiological synchrony has yet to elucidate its  impact for children's developing self-regulation. The objectives of this  systematic review were to: 1) determine whether there is evidence that  caregiver-child physiological synchrony promotes positive child development, 2)  examine developmental differences in physiological synchrony and its correlates,  and 3) explore whether context, risk, and/or stress influence patterns of  synchrony. Sixty-nine studies met the following criteria on PubMed and PsycINFO:  1) peer-reviewed empirical articles in English that 2) examine autonomic,  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical, and/or central nervous system activity 3)  for caregivers and children 4) in response to a task and 5) directly examine the  association between caregiver and child physiology. Findings varied based on  developmental period and current behavioral context. Functional differences may  exist across physiological systems and contexts. Synchrony may have different  developmental consequences for dyads with and without certain risk factors. Few  studies examine physiological synchrony across multiple systems or contexts, nor  do they measure child characteristics associated with synchrony. Statistical and  methodological challenges impede interpretation. Findings generally support the  idea that physiological synchrony may support children's developing  self-regulation. Longitudinal research is needed to examine child developmental  outcomes over time.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001236 PMID: 33427185 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

(4)Department of Psychology, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada.	The current study had three goals. First, we replicated recent evidence that  suggests a concurrent relation between attention bias to reward and  externalizing and attention problems at age 7. Second, we extended these  findings by examining the relations between attention and behavioral measures of  early exuberance (3 years), early effortful control (4 years), and concurrent  effortful control (7 years), as well as later behavioral problems (9 years).  Third, we evaluated the role of attention to reward in the longitudinal pathways  between early exuberance and early effortful control to predict externalizing  and attention problems. Results revealed that attention bias to reward was  associated concurrently and longitudinally with behavioral problems. Moreover,  greater reward bias was concurrently associated with lower levels of  parent-reported effortful control. Finally, attention bias to reward moderated  the longitudinal relations between early risk factors for behavioral problems  (gender, exuberance, and effortful control) and later externalizing and  attention problems, such that these early risk factors were most predictive of  behavioral problems for males with a large attention bias to reward. These  findings suggest that attention bias to reward may act as a moderator of early  risk, aiding the identification of children at the highest risk for later  behavioral problems.

Luthar SS(1)(2), Ebbert AM(1), Kumar NL(1).	Author information: (1)Authentic Connections, Tempe, AZ,USA. (2)Columbia University's Teachers College - Emerita.	When children are exposed to serious life adversities, Ed Zigler believed that  developmental scientists must expediently strive to illuminate the most critical  directions for beneficial interventions. In this paper, we present a new study  on risk and resilience on adolescents during COVID-19, bookended - in  introductory and concluding discussions - by descriptions of programmatic work  anchored in lessons learned from Zigler. The new study was conducted during the  first two months of the pandemic, using a mixed-methods approach with a sample  of over 2,000 students across five high schools. Overall, rates of clinically  significant symptoms were generally lower as compared to norms documented in  2019. Multivariate regressions showed that the most robust, unique associations  with teens' distress were with feelings of stress around parents and support  received from them. Open ended responses to three questions highlighted concerns  about schoolwork and college, but equally, emphasized worries about families'  well-being, and positive outreach from school adults. The findings have recurred  across subsequent school assessments, and strongly resonate with contemporary  perspectives on resilience in science and policy. If serious distress is to be  averted among youth under high stress, interventions must attend not just to the  children's mental health but that of salient caregiving adults at home and  school. The article concludes with some specific recommendations for  community-based initiatives to address mental health through continued  uncertainties of the pandemic.

(3)University of California,Los Angeles.	Psychosocial stress during childhood and adolescence is associated with  alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and with heightened  inflammation, both of which are implicated in poor health; however, factors that  may protect against these effects relatively early in life are not well  understood. Thus, we examined whether psychosocial resources protect against  stress-related alterations in the HPA axis and heightened inflammation in a  sample of 91 late adolescents. Participants completed measures of various  stressors (major life events, daily interpersonal stress, early adversity), and  psychosocial resources (mastery, optimism, self-esteem, and positive  reappraisal). They also completed the Trier Social Stress Test and provided  saliva and blood samples for the assessment of cortisol and interleukin-6  reactivity. Each of the stressors was associated with lower cortisol reactivity.  Additionally, associations with major life events and daily stress were  moderated by psychological resources, such that more life events and daily  stress were associated with decreased HPA reactivity among adolescents with  lower levels of psychological resources, but not among those with higher levels  of psychological resources. This pattern of findings was observed only for  cortisol reactivity and not for interleukin-6 reactivity. Findings suggest that  psychological resources may counteract the effects of certain adversity-related  decreases in cortisol reactivity.

Father absence, age at menarche, and genetic confounding: A replication and  extension using a polygenic score.	Schlomer GL(1), Marceau K(2).	Author information: (1)Division of Educational Psychology and Methodology, University at Albany,  SUNY, Albany, NY, USA. (2)Human Development and Family Studies, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN,  USA.	Father absence has a small but robust association with earlier age at menarche  (AAM), likely reflecting both genetic confounding and an environmental influence  on life history strategy development. Studies that have attempted to  disambiguate genetic versus environmental contributions to this association have  shown conflicting findings, though genomic-based studies have begun to establish  the role of gene-environment interplay in the father absence/AAM literature. The  purpose of this study was to replicate and extend prior genomic work using the  Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a prospective  longitudinal cohort study (N = 2,685), by (a) testing if an AAM polygenic score  (PGS) could account for the father absence/AAM association, (b) replicating G×E  research on lin-28 homolog B (LIN28B) variation and father absence, and (c)  testing the G×E hypothesis using the PGS. Results showed that the PGS could not  explain the father absence/AAM association and there was no interaction between  father absence and the PGS. Findings using LIN28B largely replicated prior work  that showed LIN28B variants predicted later AAM in father-present girls, but  this AAM-delaying effect was absent or reversed in father-absent girls. Findings  are discussed in terms genetic confounding, the unique biological role of  LIN28B, and using PGSs for G×E tests.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000929 PMID: 33107423

Externalizing behaviors (EBs) pertain to a diverse set of aggressive,  antisocial, and potentially destructive behaviors directed toward the external  environment. They range from nonclinical to clinical in severity, associated  with opposition, aggression, hyperactivity, or impulsivity, and are considered a  risk factor for the emergence of psychopathology later in adulthood. Focusing on  community adolescents (N = 102; 49 female and 53 male adolescents; age range  12-19 years), this study aimed to explore the relations between EBs and the  cortical thickness of regions of interest as well as to identify possible risk  markers that could improve understanding of the EB construct. Using a mixed  cross-sectional and prospective design (1-year follow-up), we report specific  associations with cortical thickness of the left insular, right orbitofrontal,  and left anterior cingulate cortex. Specifically, thinner left insular and right  orbitofrontal cortex was associated with higher EBs, and thinner left anterior  cingulate cortex predicted less reduction in EBs 1 year later. In addition,  further examination of the aggression and rule-breaking subscales of the  Youth/Adult Self-Report, used to assess EBs, revealed specific associations with  insular subregions. Findings suggest that cortical structure morphology may  significantly relate to the expression and maintenance of EBs within the general  population of adolescents.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, Zhejiang University,  Hangzhou, China. (2)Institute of Psychological Science, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou,  China. (3)Faculty of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.	Based on attachment theory and a social-cognitive model of posttraumatic stress  disorder (PTSD), this study examined the roles of parent-child communication,  perceived parental depression, and intrusive rumination in the association  between insecure attachment to parents and PTSD among adolescents following the  Jiuzhaigou earthquake. In this study, 620 adolescents were recruited to complete  self-report questionnaires. The results showed that the direct association  between anxious attachment and PTSD was significant, but that between avoidant  attachment and PTSD was non-significant. In addition, both anxious and avoidant  attachment had indirect associations with PTSD via the mediating effects of  parent-child communication openness and problems, perceived parental depression,  and intrusive rumination. However, the specific paths between anxious and  avoidant attachment and PTSD were different. The findings indicated that  insecure attachment among adolescents following the earthquake was predictive  for their PTSD, and the mechanisms underlying the association between anxious  attachment and PTSD and the association between avoidant attachment and PTSD  were distinct. To alleviate PTSD, more attention should be paid to improving the  quality of parent-child communication for adolescents with avoidant attachment  to parents, and to reducing negative cognition in adolescents with anxious  attachment.

Author information: (1)Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work,Florida International  University. (2)Center for Children and Families,Florida International University. (3)Department of Psychiatry,University of Michigan,Ann Arbor.	Childhood adversity can negatively impact development across various domains,  including physical and mental health. Adverse childhood experiences have been  linked to aggression and substance use; however, developmental pathways to  explain these associations are not well characterized. Understanding early  precursors to later problem behavior and substance use can inform preventive  interventions. The aim of the current study was to examine neurobiological  pathways through which childhood adversity may lead to early adolescent problem  behavior and substance use in late adolescence by testing two prospective  models. Our first model found that early adolescent externalizing behavior  mediates the association between childhood adversity and alcohol, cigarette, and  marijuana use in late adolescence. Our second model found that activation in the  anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during an inhibitory control task mediates the  association between childhood adversity and early adolescent externalizing  behavior, with lower ACC activation associated with higher levels of adversity  and more externalizing behavior. Together these findings indicate that the path  to substance use in late adolescence from childhood adversity may operate  through lower functioning in the ACC related to inhibitory control and  externalizing behavior. Early life stressors should be considered an integral  component in the etiology and prevention of early and problematic substance use.

This randomized controlled trial investigated the efficacy of Attachment and  Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC; Dozier, Bick, & Bernard, 2011) in reducing  disrupted parenting behavior (affective communication errors, role/boundary  confusion, fearful/disoriented, intrusive/negativity, and withdrawal) and its  association with disorganized attachment. Participants were 105 mother-child  dyads randomized to receive either ABC or a control intervention (a 10-session  home-visiting intervention focused on improving children's cognitive abilities,  gross and fine motor abilities, and language development). At the time of study  enrollment, mothers were approximately 26.7 years old (SD = 7.8) and  predominantly Black or African American (73.9%). At the first follow-up visit,  children were approximately 20.7 months old (SD = 6.3) and most were identified  as Black or African American (61.9%). Fifty-two percent of children were male (n  = 55). Assessments of disrupted parenting behavior and child attachment quality  were assessed approximately 7 months postintervention (SD = 5.8). A one-way  analysis of variance revealed that parents who received ABC demonstrated lower  levels of parental withdrawal than parents who received the control condition. A  structural equation model revealed a significant indirect effect of intervention  group on attachment quality through lower levels of parental withdrawal. Results  add to the efficacy of the ABC intervention and identified parental withdrawal  as a mediator of change.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419000786 PMCID: PMC6994358 PMID: 31366415 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Deer LK(1), Shields GS(1), Ivory SL(2), Hostinar CE(1), Telzer EH(2).	Author information: (1)University of California,Davis. (2)University of North Carolina,Chapel Hill.	Racial/ethnic minorities are more vulnerable to mental and physical health  problems, but we know little about the psychobiological underpinnings of these  disparities. In this study, we examined racial/ethnic differences in cortisol  diurnal patterns and affect as initial steps toward elucidating long-term health  disparities. A racially/ethnically diverse (39.5% White, 60.5% minority) sample  of 370 adolescents (57.3% female) between the ages of 11.9 and 18 years (M =  14.65 years, SD = 1.39) participated in this study. These adolescents provided  16 cortisol samples (4 samples per day across 4 days), allowing the computation  of diurnal cortisol slopes, the cortisol awakening response, and diurnal  cortisol output (area under the curve), as well as daily diary ratings of  high-arousal and low-arousal positive and negative affect. Consistent with prior  research, we found that racial/ethnic minorities (particularly African American  and Latino youth) exhibited flatter diurnal cortisol slopes compared to White  youth, F (1, 344.7) = 5.26, p = .02, effect size g = 0.25. Furthermore, African  American and Asian American youth reported lower levels of positive affect (both  high arousal and low arousal) compared to White youth. Racial/ethnic differences  in affect did not explain differences in cortisol patterns, suggesting a need to  refine our models of relations between affect and  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical activity. We conclude by proposing that a  deeper understanding of cultural development may help elucidate the complex  associations between affect and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical  functioning and how they explain racial/ethnic differences in both affect and  stress biology.

Characterizing competence among a high-risk sample of emerging adults:  Prospective predictions and biological considerations.

Few conditions epitomize severe and chronic stress to a greater extent than  child maltreatment, which can derail development across multiple domains of  functioning and throughout the life course. Furthermore, child maltreatment  tends to co-occur with other adversities, such as poverty. Many individuals grow  up under the stressful conditions of these adversities and exhibit developmental  competence. The current study prospectively charted the developmental  progression of economically disadvantaged maltreated and nonmaltreated children  from childhood to emerging adulthood, and examined patterns of competence across  multiple developmental domains of functioning central to the period of emerging  adulthood. The study investigated childhood precursors to these patterns of  adaptation and maladaptation, as well as the physiological cost of these  patterns of adaptation (i.e., C-reactive protein; CRP). Latent class analysis  revealed four distinct classes of functioning: multifaceted competence across  domains (Multifaceted Competence); (multifaceted maladaptation across domains  (Multi-Problem); (c) and two classes with mixed patterns of competence and  maladaptation (Externalizing Problems and Work/School Impairment). Maltreated  individuals were less likely than nonmaltreated individuals to demonstrate  patterns of multifaceted competence and more likely to demonstrate aggregate  maladaptation across domains. Additionally, Black men who demonstrated a pattern  of multifaceted psychosocial competence also evidenced higher levels of  low-grade inflammation (indexed by CRP), suggesting physiological distress was  associated with adaptation in the context of stress among these individuals.  Findings demonstrate the heterogenous patterns of functioning and diverse  developmental outcomes that follow early adversity.

(2)Institute for Policy Research, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.	We review evidence of racial discrimination as a critical and understudied form  of adversity that has the potential to impact stress biology, particularly  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. We highlight ethnic racial  identity (ERI) as a positive regulatory influence on HPA axis activity, as  indexed by levels of salivary cortisol. In past research by our group, Black  individuals with high adolescent discrimination had low adult cortisol levels  (hypocortisolism). Here, we present new analyses showing that ERI, measured  prospectively from ages 12 through 32 in 112 Black and white individuals, is  related to better-regulated cortisol levels in adulthood, particularly for Black  participants. We also describe ongoing research that explores whether the  promotion of ERI during adolescence can reduce ethnic-racial disparities in  stress biology and in emotional health and academic outcomes.

Social cognitive deficits can have many negative consequences, spanning social  withdrawal to psychopathology. Prior work has shown that child maltreatment may  associate with poorer social cognitive skills in later life. However, no studies  have examined this association from early childhood into adolescence. Using data  from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; n = 4,438), we  examined the association between maltreatment (caregiver physical or emotional  abuse; sexual or physical abuse), assessed repeatedly (every 1-3 years) from  birth to age 9, and social cognitive skills at ages 7.5, 10.5, and 14 years. We  evaluated the role of both the developmental timing (defined by age at exposure)  and accumulation of maltreatment (defined as the number of occasions exposed)  using a least angle regression variable selection procedure, followed by  structural equation modeling. Among females, accumulation of maltreatment  explained the most variation in social cognitive skills. For males, no  significant associations were found. These findings underscore the importance of  early intervention to minimize the accumulation of maltreatment and showcase the  importance of prospective studies to understand the development of social  cognition over time.

Interpersonal harm aversion as a necessary foundation for morality: A  developmental neuroscience perspective.	Decety J(1), Cowell JM(2).	Author information: (1)University of Chicago. (2)University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.	Growing evidence from developmental psychology and social neuroscience  emphasizes the importance of third-party harm aversion for constructing  morality. A sensitivity to interpersonal harm emerges very early in ontogeny, as  reflected in both the capacity for implicit social evaluation and an aversion  for antisocial agents. Yet it does not necessarily entail avoidance toward  inflicting pain to others. Later, an understanding that harmful actions cause  suffering emerges, followed by an integration of rules that can depend on social  contexts and cultures. These developmental findings build on a burgeoning  literature, which suggests that the fundamental nature of moral and social  cognition, including their motivational and hedonic value, lies in general  computational processes such as attention, approach-avoidance, social valuation,  and decision making rather than in fully distinct, dedicated neural regions for  morality. Bridging the gap between cognition and behaviors and the requisite  affective, motivational, and cognitive mechanisms, a developmental neuroscience  approach enriches our understanding of the emergence of morality.

A long-term look at "early starters": Predicting adult psychosocial outcomes  from childhood conduct problem trajectories.	Cyr M(1)(2), Zheng Y(3), McMahon RJ(1)(2).	Author information: (1)Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. (2)BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia,  Canada. (3)University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.	Current evidence suggests that multiple pathways of "early-starting" conduct  problems exist, including persisting and declining trajectories. Since  relatively little is known about the early onset-declining pathway, this study  examined the long-term outcomes of different childhood conduct problem  trajectories in a disproportionately high-risk sample (N = 754). Parents  reported on children's conduct problems at six time points (kindergarten to  grade 7). At age 25, psychosocial outcomes were assessed across five domains  (psychopathology, substance use, risky sexual behavior, antisocial behavior, and  adaptive outcomes). Four childhood conduct problem trajectories were identified:  extremely high increasing (EHI; 3.7%), high stable (HS; 22.0%), moderate  decreasing (MD; 38.8%), and low decreasing (LD; 35.5%). The EHI and HS groups  displayed the poorest psychosocial functioning at age 25, whereas the LD group  exhibited the most positive adjustment. Although individuals in the MD group  displayed relatively positive adjustment on some outcomes, they displayed more  psychopathology and lower well-being in adulthood than the LD group. These  findings suggest that there are diverse pathways of early-starting conduct  problems, and that all early starters are at risk for later maladjustment.  However, the degree and type of risk is related to the severity of conduct  problems throughout childhood.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000760 PMID: 33004093

(4)Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry,  Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, UK.	Both preterm birth and early institutional deprivation are associated with  neurodevelopmental impairment-with both shared and distinctive features. To  explore shared underlying mechanisms, this study directly compared the effects  of these putative risk factors on temperament profiles in six-year-olds:  Children born very preterm (<32 weeks gestation) or at very low birthweight  (<1500 g) from the Bavarian Longitudinal Study (n = 299); and children who  experienced >6 months of deprivation in Romanian institutions from the English  and Romanian Adoptees Study (n = 101). The former were compared with 311 healthy  term born controls and the latter with 52 nondeprived adoptees. At 6 years,  temperament was assessed via parent reports across 5 dimensions: effortful  control, activity, shyness, emotionality, and sociability. Very preterm/very low  birthweight and postinstitutionalized children showed similarly aberrant  profiles in terms of lower effortful control, preterm = -0.50, 95% CI [-0.67,  -0.33]; postinstitutionalized = -0.48, 95% CI [-0.82, -0.14], compared with  their respective controls. Additionally, postinstitutionalized children showed  higher activity, whereas very preterm/very low birthweight children showed lower  shyness. Preterm birth and early institutionalization are similarly associated  with poorer effortful control, which might contribute to long-term  vulnerability. More research is needed to examine temperamental processes as  common mediators of negative long-term outcomes following early adversity.

Author information: (1)Department of Global Health Promotion, Tokyo Medical and Dental University  (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan. (2)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, Japan.	The aim of this study is to examine the association between maternal adverse  childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health problems in adolescent offspring.  Data were obtained from the population-based Kochi Child Health Impact of Living  Difficulty (K-CHILD) study in 2016, and participants were 10,810 children in the  fifth grade (3,144 pairs), eighth grade (3,497 pairs), and eleventh grade (4,169  pairs) living in Kochi Prefecture, Japan. Mothers of participating children were  asked about their ACEs, childhood social economic status, current mental and  physical health, current social economic status, positive parenting behaviors,  child maltreatment, marital status, and child behavior problems using the  Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire. Children reported their depressive  symptoms using the Depression Self-Rating Scale. Children of mothers with a  larger number of ACEs showed higher levels of behavior problems (p for trend  <.001) and depressive symptoms (p for trend <.001), adjusting for potential  confounders. In particular, maternal psychological distress mediated the  association between maternal ACEs and child mental health. The adverse effects  of maternal ACEs may have a direct intergenerational impact on behavior problems  and depressive symptoms in adolescent offspring. Further studies to elucidate  possible mediators are needed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000334 PMID: 32478651

Enhancing caregiving may mitigate these effects. Attachment and  Biobehavioral Catch-Up (ABC) is an intervention that has been shown to improve  parent-child relationships and a variety of biological and behavioral outcomes  among children that are involved in Child Protective Services. This preliminary  study, using a small sample size, explored whether children who received ABC  exhibit different methylation patterns than those who received a control  intervention. The participants included 23 children aged 6-21 months who were  randomized to receive ABC (n = 12) or a control intervention (n = 11). While the  children displayed similar methylation patterns preintervention, DNA methylation  varied between the ABC and control groups at 14,828 sites postintervention.  Functional pathway analyses indicated that these differences were associated  with gene pathways that are involved in cell signaling, metabolism, and neuronal  development. This study is one of the first to explore parenting intervention  effects on children's DNA methylation at the whole genome level in infancy.  These preliminary findings provide a basis for hypothesis generation in further  research with larger-scale studies regarding the malleability of epigenetic  states that are associated with maltreatment.

Children who are adopted from care are more likely to experience enduring  emotional and behavioral problems across development; however, adoptees'  trajectories of mental health problems and factors that impact their  trajectories are poorly understood. Therefore, we used multilevel growth  analyses to chart adoptees' internalizing and externalizing problems across  childhood, and examined the associations between preadoptive risk and  postadoptive protective factors on their trajectories. This was investigated in  a prospective longitudinal study of case file records (N = 374) and  questionnaire-based follow-ups (N = 96) at approximately 5, 21, and 36 months  postadoptive placement. Preadoptive adversity (indexed by age at placement, days  in care, and number of adverse childhood experiences) was associated with higher  internalizing and externalizing scores; the decrease in internalizing scores  over childhood was accelerated for those exposed to lower levels of preadoptive  risk. Warm adoptive parenting was associated with a marked reduction in  children's internalizing and externalizing problems over time. Although  potentially limited by shared methods variance and lack of variability in  parental warmth scores, these findings demonstrate the deleterious impact of  preadoptive risk and the positive role of exceptionally warm adoptive parenting  on children's trajectories of mental health problems and have relevance for  prevention and intervention strategies.

Differential susceptibility theory (DST) posits that individuals differ in their  developmental plasticity: some children are highly responsive to both  environmental adversity and support, while others are less affected. According  to this theory, "plasticity" genes that confer risk for psychopathology in  adverse environments may promote superior functioning in supportive  environments. We tested DST using a broad measure of child genetic liability  (based on birth parent psychopathology), adoptive home environmental variables  (e.g., marital warmth, parenting stress, and internalizing symptoms), and  measures of child externalizing problems (n = 337) and social competence (n =  330) in 54-month-old adopted children from the Early Growth and Development  Study. This adoption design is useful for examining DST because children are  placed at birth or shortly thereafter with nongenetically related adoptive  parents, naturally disentangling heritable and postnatal environmental effects.  We conducted a series of multivariable regression analyses that included Gene ×  Environment interaction terms and found little evidence of DST; rather,  interactions varied depending on the environmental factor of interest, in both  significance and shape. Our mixed findings suggest further investigation of DST  is warranted before tailoring screening and intervention recommendations to  children based on their genetic liability or "sensitivity."

Longitudinal effects of maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and Reminiscing  and Emotion Training on children's diurnal cortisol regulation.

Dysregulation in children's physiological stress systems is a key process  linking early adversity to poor health and psychopathology. Thus, interventions  that improve children's stress physiology may help prevent deleterious health  outcomes. Reminiscing and Emotion Training (RET) is a brief relational  intervention designed to improve maternal caregiving support by enhancing  maltreating mothers' capacity to reminisce with their young children. This study  evaluated associations between maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and the  RET intervention with changes in children's diurnal cortisol regulation across  the 1 year following the intervention, and the extent to which improvements in  maternal elaborative reminiscing differed between intervention groups and  mediated change in children's physiological functioning. Participants were 237  children (aged 36 to 86 months) and their mothers. Results indicated that the  RET intervention was associated with significant positive change in elaborative  reminiscing, which was sustained over time. Mothers' elaboration immediately  after the intervention served as a mediator of RET's effects on improvements in  children's diurnal cortisol regulation (steeper diurnal slopes) from baseline to  1 year following intervention. This suggests RET is effective in facilitating  physiological regulation among maltreated children.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457942000019X PMCID: PMC7854853 PMID: 32665044

The intergenerational transmission of childhood maltreatment: Nonspecificity of  maltreatment type and associations with borderline personality pathology.	Paul SE(1), Boudreaux MJ(1), Bondy E(1), Tackett JL(2), Oltmanns TF(1), Bogdan  R(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences,Washington University in St.  Louis,St. Louis, MO,USA. (2)Department of Psychology,Northwestern University,Evanston, IL,USA.	One generation's experience of childhood maltreatment is associated with that of  the next. However, whether this intergenerational transmission is specific to  distinct forms of maltreatment and what factors may contribute to its continuity  remains unclear. Borderline personality pathology is predicted by childhood  maltreatment and characterized by features (e.g., dysregulated emotion,  relationship instability, impulsivity, and inconsistent appraisals of others)  that may contribute to its propagation. Among 364 older adults and 573 of their  adult children (total n = 937), self-reported exposure to distinct forms of  childhood maltreatment (i.e., emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and  emotional and physical neglect as assessed by the Childhood Trauma  Questionnaire) showed homotypic and heterotypic associations across generations  with little evidence that latent factors unique to specific forms of  maltreatment show generational continuity. General nonspecific indices of  childhood maltreatment showed evidence of intergenerational transmission after  accounting for demographic factors and parent socioeconomic status (b = 0.126, p  = 9.21 × 10-4). This continuity was partially mediated by parental borderline  personality pathology (assessed longitudinally through a variety of measures and  sources, indirect effect: b = 0.031, 95% confidence interval [0.003, 0.060]).  The intergenerational continuity of childhood maltreatment may largely represent  general risk for nonspecific maltreatment that may, in part, be propagated by  borderline personality pathology and/or shared risk factors.

Difficulties in regulating affect are core characteristics of a wide range of  mental health conditions and are associated with deficits in cognitive control,  particularly in affective contexts, affective control. The current study  explored how affective control relates to mental health over the course of  adolescence. We developed an Affective Control Task, which was administered to  young adolescents (11-14 years; n = 29); mid-adolescents (15-18 years; n = 31),  and adults (22-30 years; n = 31). The task required individuals to sort cards  according to continuously changing rules: color, number, or item type. There was  a neutral condition in which items were shapes, and an affective condition, in  which items were emotional facial expressions. Better affective control was  associated with fewer mental health difficulties (p < .001, R2 = .15). Affective  control partially accounted for the association between age group and mental  health problems, z = 2.61, p = .009, Akaike information criterion = 484, with  the association being strongest in young adolescents, r (27) = -.44, p = .018.  Affective control further accounted for variance in the association between  self-reported (but not experimental) emotion regulation and mental health (z =  -3.44, p < .001, Akaike information criterion = 440). Poor affective control,  especially in young adolescents, is associated with more mental health problems  and higher levels of emotion regulation difficulties. Improving affective  control therefore may constitute a promising target for prevention.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419000099 PMCID: PMC6982534 PMID: 30907719 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Atypical communication characteristics (ACCs), such as speech delay, odd pitch,  and pragmatic difficulties, are common features of autism spectrum disorder  (ASD) as are the symptoms of a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Using a  simple retrospective method, this study aimed to better understand the relation  and stability of ACCs with a broad range of psychiatric symptoms among large,  well-characterized samples of clinic-referred children and adolescents with and  without ASD. Youth with ASD had higher rates and a more variable pattern of  developmental change in ACCs than the non-ASD diagnostic group. Latent class  analysis yielded three ACC stability subgroups within ASD: Stable ACCs, Mostly  Current-Only ACCs, and Little Professors. Subgroups exhibited differences in  severity of ASD symptomatology, co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, and other  correlates. Our findings provide support for the clinical utility of  characterizing caregiver-perceived changes in ACCs in identifying children at  risk for co-occurring psychopathology and other clinically relevant variables.

Relations between child self-control, maternal relational frustration, and  teacher-child conflict: a longitudinal study with children from dual-earner  families.	Ferreira T(1), Cadima J(1), Matias M(1), Leal T(1), Mena Matos P(1).	Author information: (1)Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences, Center for Psychology at  University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.	This longitudinal study follows children from dual-earner families in 4  time-points, covering the early childhood period. We examined the influence of  work-family conflict (WFC) on maternal relational frustration (RF) towards the  child, and investigated the reciprocal relations among maternal RF, children's  self-control (SC), and teacher-child (TC) conflict over time. Participants were  214 children (97 girls; M age = 4.00 years), their mothers, and teachers.  Mothers reported their own WFC and RF, whereas teachers reported child SC and  T-C conflict. Results from a cross-lagged panel model indicated the experience  of WFC positively predicted maternal RF. Maternal RF and T-C conflict were  negatively related to the child later SC abilities. Conversely, children who  displayed SC difficulties were more likely to experience later maternal RF and  T-C conflict. There was evidence supporting the bidirectional effects of child  SC and T-C conflict across time. Moreover, maternal RF and T-C conflict were  indirectly linked, via child SC. The findings are consistent with a  transactional view of development, stressing the importance of contextual  factors to the quality of caregiving relationships and highlighting the complex  and reciprocal relations between child regulatory competence and the quality of  relationships with distinct caregivers.

Recent models of psychopathology suggest the presence of a general factor  capturing the shared variance among all symptoms along with specific  psychopathology factors (e.g., internalizing and externalizing). However, few  studies have examined predictors that may serve as transdiagnostic risk factors  for general psychopathology from early development. In the current study we  examine, for the first time, whether observed and parent-reported infant  temperament dimensions prospectively predict general psychopathology as well as  specific psychopathology dimensions (e.g., internalizing and externalizing)  across childhood. In a longitudinal cohort (N = 291), temperament dimensions  were assessed at 4 months of age. Psychopathology symptoms were assessed at 7,  9, and 12 years of age. A bifactor model was used to estimate general,  internalizing, and externalizing psychopathology factors. Across behavioral  observations and parent-reports, higher motor activity in infancy significantly  predicted greater general psychopathology in mid to late childhood. Moreover,  low positive affect was predictive of the internalizing-specific factor. Other  temperament dimensions were not related with any of the psychopathology factors  after accounting for the general psychopathology factor. The results of this  study suggest that infant motor activity may act as an early indicator of  transdiagnostic risk. Our findings inform the etiology of general  psychopathology and have implications for the early identification for children  at risk for psychopathology.

A Preliminary, Randomized-Controlled Trial of Mindfulness and Game-Based  Executive Function Trainings to Promote Self-Regulation in  Internationally-Adopted Children.

Although many children adopted internationally show remarkable recovery once  placed in families, as a group they continue to exhibit persisting developmental  deficits and delays in self-regulation. The current study uses a stratified,  randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effects of mindfulness-based and  executive function trainings (EFTs) on internationally adopted (IA) children's  self-regulation, including effortful/inhibitory control, attention, delay of  gratification, and emotion-regulation. IA children ages 6-10 years were  randomized into mindfulness training (MT), EFT, or no intervention (NI) groups.  The MT and EFT groups attended 12 one-hour group sessions. Ninety-six children  (MT, n = 33; EFT, n = 32; NI, n = 31) completed the study and were tested on  computerized and non-computerized measures of self-regulation. Compared with the  NI group, the MT group improved delay of gratification, and the EFT group  improved inhibitory control and selective attention. There was no effect of  either intervention on emotion regulation. MTs and EFTs show promise for  improving self-regulation in IA children.

Berry D(1), Palmer AR(1), Distefano R(1), Masten AS(1).	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota,Minneapolis,MN,USA.	Developing the ability to regulate one's emotions in accordance with contextual  demands (i.e., emotion regulation) is a central developmental task of early  childhood. These processes are supported by the engagement of the autonomic  nervous system (ANS), a physiological hub of a vast network tasked with  dynamically integrating real-time experiential inputs with internal motivational  and goal states. To date, much of what is known about the ANS and emotion  regulation has been based on measures of respiratory sinus arrhythmia, a cardiac  indicator of parasympathetic activity. In the present study, we draw from  dynamical systems models to introduce two nonlinear indices of cardiac  complexity (fractality and sample entropy) as potential indicators of these  broader ANS dynamics. Using data from a stratified sample of preschoolers living  in high- (i.e., emergency homeless shelter) and low-risk contexts (N = 115), we  show that, in conjunction with respiratory sinus arrhythmia, these nonlinear  indices may help to clarify important differences in the behavioral  manifestations of emotion regulation. In particular, our results suggest that  cardiac complexity may be especially useful for discerning active, effortful  emotion regulation from less effortful regulation and dysregulation.

This study used repeated measures data to identify developmental profiles of  elevated risk for ADHD (i.e., six or more inattentive and/or  hyperactive-impulsive symptoms), with an interest in the age at which ADHD risk  first emerged. Risk factors that were measured across the first 3 years of life  were used to predict profile membership. Participants included 1,173 children  who were drawn from the Family Life Project, an ongoing longitudinal study of  children's development in low-income, nonmetropolitan communities. Four  heuristic profiles of ADHD risk were identified. Approximately two thirds of  children never exhibited elevated risk for ADHD. The remaining children were  characterized by early childhood onset and persistent risk (5%), early childhood  limited risk (10%), and middle childhood onset risk (19%). Pregnancy and  delivery complications and harsh-intrusive caregiving behaviors operated as  general risk for all ADHD profiles. Parental history of ADHD was uniquely  predictive of early onset and persistent ADHD risk, and low primary caregiver  education was uniquely predictive of early childhood limited ADHD risk. Results  are discussed with respect to how changes to the age of onset criterion for ADHD  in DSM5 may affect etiological research and the need for developmental models of  ADHD that inform ADHD symptom persistence and desistance.

We conducted signal detection analyses to test for curvilinear, U-shaped  relations between early experiences of adversity and heightened physiological  responses to challenge, as proposed by biological sensitivity to context theory.  Based on analysis of an ethnically diverse sample of 338 kindergarten children  (4-6 years old) and their families, we identified levels and types of adversity  that, singly and interactively, predicted high (top 25%) and low (bottom 25%)  rates of stress reactivity. The results offered support for the hypothesized  U-shaped curve and conceptually replicated and extended the work of Ellis,  Essex, and Boyce (2005). Across both sympathetic and adrenocortical systems, a  disproportionate number of children growing up under conditions characterized by  either low or high adversity (as indexed by restrictive parenting, family  stress, and family economic condition) displayed heightened stress reactivity,  compared with peers growing up under conditions of moderate adversity. Finally,  as hypothesized by the adaptive calibration model, a disproportionate number of  children who experienced exceptionally stressful family conditions displayed  blunted cortisol reactivity to stress.

There has been a longstanding debate about the link between callous-unemotional  traits and fearlessness. However, biological evidence for a relationship in  adolescents is lacking. Using two adolescent samples, we measured emotional  reactivity and cardiac measures of sympathetic (pre-ejection period) and  parasympathetic (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) reactivity during 3D TV and  virtual reality fear induction. Study 1 included 62 community adolescents from a  stratified sample. Study 2 included 60 adolescents from Emotional and Behavioral  Difficulties schools. Results were consistent across both studies. Adolescents  with high callous-unemotional traits showed coactivation of the sympathetic and  parasympathetic nervous system. Consistent with these results, youths with  callous-unemotional traits self-reported that they felt more in control after  the fear induction. Thus, in both samples, youth with callous-unemotional traits  displayed a physiological and emotional profile suggesting they maintained  control during fear induction. Therefore, it is proposed here that a shift in  thinking of youth with callous-unemotional traits as fearless to youth with  callous-unemotional traits are better able to manage fearful situations, may be  more appropriate.

Additive and bidirectional effects of executive control and  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation on children's adjustment  were examined, along with the effects of low income and cumulative risk on  executive control and the HPA axis. The study utilized longitudinal data from a  community sample of preschool age children (N = 306, 36-39 months at Time 1)  whose families were recruited to overrepresent low-income contexts. We tested  the effects of low income and cumulative risk on levels and growth of executive  control and HPA axis regulation (diurnal cortisol level), the bidirectional  effects of executive control and the HPA axis on each other, and their additive  effects on children's adjustment problems, social competence and academic  readiness. Low income predicted lower Time 4 executive control, and cumulative  risk predicted lower Time 4 diurnal cortisol level. There was little evidence of  bidirectional effects of executive control and diurnal cortisol. However, both  executive control and diurnal cortisol predicted Time 4 adjustment, suggesting  additive effects. There were indirect effects of income on all three adjustment  outcomes through executive control, and of cumulative risk on adjustment  problems and social competence through diurnal cortisol. The results provide  evidence that executive control and diurnal cortisol additively predict  children's adjustment and partially account for the effects of income and  cumulative risk on adjustment.

Among children exposed to elevated maternal depression symptoms (MDS), recent  studies have demonstrated reduced internalizing and externalizing problems for  those who have attended formal childcare (i.e., center-based, family-based  childcare). However, these studies did not consider whether childcare attendance  is associated with benefits for the child only or also with reduced MDS. Using a  four-wave longitudinal cross-lagged model, we evaluated whether formal childcare  attendance was associated with MDS or child behavior problems and whether it  moderated longitudinal associations between MDS and child behavior problems and  between child behavior problems and MDS. The sample was drawn from a  population-based cohort study and consisted of 908 biologically related  mother-child dyads, followed from 5 months to 5 years. Attending formal  childcare was not associated with MDS or child behavior problems but moderated  the association between MDS at 3.5 years and child internalizing and  externalizing problems at 5 years as well as between girls' externalizing  problems at 3.5 years and MDS at 5 years. No other moderation of formal  childcare was found. Findings suggest that attending formal childcare reduces  the risks of behavior problems in the context of MDS but also the risk of MDS in  the context of girls' externalizing problems.

Vannucci A(1), Flannery KM(1), McCauley Ohannessian C(1).	Author information: (1)Connecticut Children's Medical Center.	The objective of the current study was to apply the novel technique of  time-varying effect modeling to examine age-varying associations between  specific coping strategies and depressive symptoms across adolescence and  emerging adulthood (ages 14-24). The participants were drawn from a community  sample and followed across 4 years of high school and once 5 years  postgraduation (N = 1,251, 53% female, 58% non-Hispanic White). Coping and  depressive symptom questionnaires were administered across all data collection  time points. Time-varying effect modeling used all available data (N = 5,651  measurement occasions) and adjusted for gender. Venting emotions and denial were  associated with more depressive symptoms at a similar magnitude across  adolescence and emerging adulthood. A positive association between problem  solving oriented strategies (planning, active coping) and depressive symptoms  was not observed until age 17.5, after which the magnitude of the association  strengthened. More frequent instrumental and emotional support seeking were  linked to fewer depressive symptoms between ages 18.8 and 23.6. More frequent  use of humor was associated with greater depressive symptoms from ages 14.0 to  14.6, but with fewer depressive symptoms from ages 16.8 to 18.8. The findings  illuminate when and how associations between specific coping strategies and  depressive symptoms may emerge and change across developmental age, generating  both theoretical and clinical implications.

An examination of reciprocal associations between substance use and effortful  control across adolescence using a bifactor model of externalizing symptoms.	Paige KJ(1), Meisel SN(1), Colder CR(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University at Buffalo, State University of New  York, Buffalo, NY, USA.	Early adolescence is thought to represent a window of vulnerability when  exposure to substances is particularly harmful, partly because the neurotoxic  effects of adolescent substance use may derail self-regulation development.  However, previous studies fail to account for externalizing symptoms, such as  aggression and delinquency, that accompany adolescent substance use and may also  derail the development of self-regulation. The current study aims to clarify  whether the neurotoxic effects of adolescent substance use are associated with  deficits in effortful control (EC) after accounting for externalizing symptoms  and to examine reciprocal relationships between EC, externalizing symptoms, and  substance use. A longitudinal sample of adolescents (N = 387) was used to  estimate bifactor models of externalizing symptoms across five assessments (Mage  = 11.6 to 19.9). The broad general externalizing factors were prospectively  associated with declines in EC across adolescence and emerging adulthood.  However, the narrow substance use specific factors were not prospectively  associated with EC. Findings suggest that the broader externalizing context, but  not the specific neurotoxic effects of substance use, may hamper self-regulation  development. It is critical to account for the hierarchical structure of  psychopathology, namely externalizing symptoms, when considering development of  EC.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000644 PMID: 32662367

Development involves synergistic interplay among genotypes and the physical and  cultural environments, and integrating genetics into experimental designs that  manipulate the environment can improve understanding of developmental  psychopathology and intervention efficacy. Consistent with differential  susceptibility theory, individuals can vary in their sensitivity to  environmental conditions including intervention for reasons including their  genotype. As a consequence, understanding genetic influences on intervention  response is critical. Empirically, we tested an interaction between a genetic  index representing sensitivity to the environment and the Family Check-Up  intervention. Participants were drawn from the Early Steps Multisite randomized  prevention trial that included a low-income and racially/ethnically diverse  sample of children and their families followed longitudinally (n = 515). As  hypothesized, polygenic sensitivity to the environment moderated the effects of  the intervention on 10-year-old children's symptoms of internalizing  psychopathology, such that children who were genetically sensitive and were  randomly assigned to the intervention had fewer symptoms of child  psychopathology than genetically sensitive children assigned to the control  condition. A significant difference in internalizing symptoms assessed with a  clinical interview emerged between the intervention and control groups for those  0.493 SD above the mean on polygenic sensitivity, or 25% of the sample. Similar  to personalized medicine, it is time to understand individual and sociocultural  differences in treatment response and individualize psychosocial interventions  to reduce the burden of child psychopathology and maximize well-being for  children growing up in a wide range of physical environments and cultures.

Youth's academic and emotional functioning are closely related, yet little is  known about the timing and direction of relationships involving internalizing  problems, which are characterized by over control of emotions, anxiety, and  depression as well as multiple aspects of academic achievement. This study  addresses these gaps using data from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth  Development (N = 1,048) to examine the processes by which problems in one domain  of functioning lead to problems in another, known as a "cascade effect." Results  of longitudinal structural equation modeling indicate (a) a direct and indirect  negative cascade effect from girls' internalizing problems to their school  achievement in high school, (b) a positive contemporaneous association of 9th  grade boys' internalizing problems with their cognitive achievement; and (c)  ways in which demographic characteristics and adolescent social and maturational  processes account for variation in functioning yet do not alter the processes by  which the emotional and academic functioning interact. Results are discussed  with regard to identifiying adolescents' internalizing problems, gender  differences in the effects of internalizing problems on academic functioning,  timing of evidence-based interventions, and implications for mental health  promotion among girls.

Stress associated with caring for a mentally ill spouse can adversely affect the  health status of caregivers and their children. Adding to the stress of  caregiving is the stigma often placed against spouses and children of people  with mental illness. Contrary to mental illness, many physical disorders such as  cancer may be less stigmatized (expect pulmonary cancer). In this study, we  measured externalized and internalized stigma, as well as psychological  (depressive symptoms and stressful life events) and physiological (basal  salivary cortisol levels) markers of stress in 115 spouses and 154 children of  parents suffering from major depressive disorder, cancer, or no illness (control  group). The results show that spouses and children from families with parental  depression present significantly more externalized stigma than spouses and  children from families with parental cancer or no illness, although we find no  group differences on internalized stigma. The analysis did not show a  significant group difference either for spouses or their children on depressive  symptomatology, although spouses from the parental depression group reported  greater work/family stress. Finally, we found that although for both spouses  children the awakening cortisol response was greater on weekdays than on weekend  days, salivary cortisol levels did not differ between groups. Bayes factor  calculated on the null result for cortisol levels was greater than 100,  providing strong evidence for the null hypothesis H0. Altogether, these results  suggest an impact of stigma toward mental health disorder on psychological  markers of stress but no impact of stigma on physiological markers of stress. We  suggest that these results may be due to the characteristics of the families who  participated in the present study.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001431 PMID: 33427165 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Maternal antenatal depression strongly influences child mental health but with  considerable inter-individual variation that is, in part, linked to genotype.  The challenge is to effectively capture the genotypic influence. We outline a  novel approach to describe genomic susceptibility to maternal antenatal  depression focusing on child emotional/behavioral difficulties. Two cohorts  provided measures of maternal depression, child genetic variation, and child  mental health symptoms. We constructed a conventional polygenic risk score (PRS)  for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (PRSADHD) that significantly  moderated the association between maternal antenatal depression and  internalizing problems at 60 months (p = 2.94 × 10-4, R2 = .18). We then  constructed an interaction PRS (xPRS) based on a subset of those single  nucleotide polymorphisms from the PRSADHD that most accounted for the moderation  of the association between maternal antenatal depression and child outcome. The  interaction between maternal antenatal depression and this xPRS accounted for a  larger proportion of the variance in child emotional/behavioral problems than  models based on any PRSADHD (p = 5.50 × 10-9, R2 = .27), with similar findings  in the replication cohort. The xPRS was significantly enriched for genes  involved in neuronal development and synaptic function. Our study illustrates a  novel approach to the study of genotypic moderation on the impact of maternal  antenatal depression on child mental health and highlights the utility of the  xPRS approach. These findings advance our understanding of individual  differences in the developmental origins of mental health.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001418 PMID: 33427178 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Childhood exposure to stress can induce prolonged negative effects on health,  which in turn confer risks for the next generation, but greater specificity is  needed to inform intervention. A first step is to measure individual differences  in emotional reactivity to stress early in life in ways that can account for  heterogeneity in child exposure. The present study tested the hypothesis that  mothers' childhood exposure to stress would be differentially associated with  patterns of positive and negative emotional reactivity in their offspring,  suggesting transmission of stress response across generations. Participants were  268 young mothers (age 14-23 years) followed longitudinally since childhood, and  their infants aged 3-9 months. Latent class analysis of infant emotions  expressed before and during the still-face paradigm yielded five subgroups that  varied in valence, intensity, and reactivity. After accounting for  sociodemographic factors, infant temperament, and postpartum depression,  multinomial regression models showed that, relative to an emotionally regulated  still-face response, infants showing low negative reactivity were more likely to  have mothers exposed to childhood emotional abuse, and infants showing high and  increasing negative reactivity were more likely to have mothers exposed to  childhood emotional neglect. Mechanisms by which early maternal stress exposure  influences emotional reactivity in offspring are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419000324 PMCID: PMC6620149 PMID: 31025614 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

(2)Department of Psychiatry and Addictology, Faculty of Medicine, University of  Montreal, Montreal, Canada.	In the past decades, there has been an overemphasis of a descriptive/behavioral  approach to study conduct disorder. In an equifinal perspective, we aimed to  examine the developmental multitrajectory groups of psychological features  (irritability, interpersonal callousness, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and  depressive-anxiety symptoms) and their associations with conduct problems. In a  population-based cohort (n = 1,309 participants followed from 5 months to 17  years old), latent-class growth analysis was performed for each psychological  feature to identify a two-trajectory model (from ages 6 to 12 years). Based on  parameter estimates of the two-trajectory models for each of the four  psychological features, a parallel process growth mixture model identified eight  significant developmental patterns that were subsequently compared with  typically developing children. Furthermore, we observed that while interpersonal  callousness conferred an increased risk for childhood and adolescence conduct  problems, its co-occurrence with hyperactivity/impulsivity, irritability, and/or  depressive-anxiety symptoms heightened the general risk, but also predicted  distinct subtypes of conduct problems (i.e., aggressive and rule-breaking  behaviors). Thus, by studying complex developmental combinations of  psychological features, we observed qualitatively distinct pathways towards  conduct problems. A multitrajectory framework of psychological features should  be considered as a significant step towards unveiling the multiple etiological  pathways leading to conduct disorder and its substantial clinical heterogeneity.

Perry NB(1), DePasquale CE(1), Donzella B(1), Gunnar MR(1).	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN,  USA.	Megan Gunnar's pubertal stress recalibration hypothesis was supported in a  recent study of previously institutionalized (PI) youth such that increases in  pubertal stage were associated with increases in cortisol stress reactivity.  This work provides evidence that puberty may open up a window of recalibration  for PI youth, resulting in a shift from a blunted to a more typical cortisol  stress response. Using the same sample (N = 132), the current study aimed to  elucidate whether increases in cortisol are associated with increases in  adaptive functioning or whether they further underlie potential links to  developmental psychopathology. Specifically, we examined the bidirectional  associations between cortisol stress reactivity and both internalizing and  externalizing symptoms across three timepoints during the pubertal period. Youth  reported on their own internalizing symptoms and parents reported on youths'  externalizing symptoms. Cortisol reactivity was assessed during the Trier social  stress test. Analyses revealed no associations between cortisol reactivity and  externalizing symptoms across puberty for PI youth. However, longitudinal  bidirectional associations did emerge for internalizing symptoms such that  increases in cortisol reactivity predicted increases in internalizing symptoms  and increases in internalizing symptoms predicted increases in cortisol  reactivity. Findings suggest that recalibrating to more normative levels of  cortisol reactivity may not always be associated with adaptive outcomes for PI  youth.

While child self-regulation is shaped by the environment (e.g., the parents'  caregiving behaviors), children also play an active role in influencing the care  they receive, indicating that children's individual differences should be  integrated in models relating early care to children's development. We assessed  409 children's observed temperamental behavioral inhibition (BI), effortful  control (EC), and the primary caregiver's parenting at child ages 3 and 5.  Parents reported on child behavior problems at child ages 3, 5, and 8. Mediation  analyses were conducted to examine relations between child temperament and  parenting in predicting child problems. BI at age 3 was positively associated  with structured parenting at age 5, which was negatively related to child  internalizing and attention-academic problems at age 8. In contrast, parenting  at child age 3 did not predict child BI or EC at age 5, nor did age 3 EC predict  parenting at age 5. Findings indicate that child behavior may shape the  development of caregiving and, in turn, long-term child adjustment, suggesting  that studies of caregiving and child outcomes should consider the role of child  temperament toward developing more informative models of child-environment  interplay.

We investigated (a) whether psychosocial factors (experienced stress,  anticipatory worry, social detachment, sleeping disturbances, alcohol use)  predict the course of paranoid ideation between the ages of 24 to 50 years and  (b) whether the predictive relationships are more likely to proceed from the  psychosocial factors to paranoid ideation, or vice versa. The participants (N =  1534-1553) came from the population-based Young Finns study. Paranoid ideation  and psychosocial factors were assessed by reliable self-report questionnaires in  2001, 2007, and 2011/2012. The data were analyzed using growth curve and  structural equation models. High experienced stress, anticipatory worry, social  detachment, frequent sleeping disturbances, and frequent alcohol use predicted  more paranoid ideation. More risk factors predicted increasing paranoid  ideation. There were bidirectional predictive relationships of paranoid ideation  with experienced stress, anticipatory worry, social detachment, and sleeping  disturbances. The link between alcohol use and paranoid ideation was only  correlative. In conclusion, paranoid ideation increases by reciprocal  interactions with stress, worry, social detachment, and sleeping disturbances.  The findings support the threat-anticipation model of paranoid ideation,  providing important implications for treatment of paranoia.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001030 PMID: 33084551

Can reactivity and regulation in infancy predict inattentive and  hyperactive/impulsive behavior in 3-year-olds?	Frick MA(1), Forslund T(1), Brocki KC(1).	Author information: (1)Uppsala University.	A need to identify early infant markers of later occurring inattentive and  hyperactive/impulsive behaviors has come to the fore in the current  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder literature. The purpose of such studies  is to identify driving mechanisms that could enable early detection of  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder liability and thus facilitate early  intervention. Here we study independent and interactive effects of cognitive  regulation (inhibition and sustained attention), temperament (reactive and  regulatory aspects), and maternal sensitivity (as external regulation) in a  sample of 112 typically developing 10-month-old infants (59 boys, 52.7%), in  relation to inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behavior at 3 years. The  results showed that infant temperamental regulation and maternal sensitivity  made independent contributions to both inattention and  hyperactivity/impulsivity, in that higher levels of temperamental regulation and  maternal sensitivity were related to less inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive  behavior. In addition, the temperamental factor positive affectivity/surgency  made a significant contribution to later hyperactivity/impulsivity, in that  higher levels of positive affectivity/surgency were related to more  hyperactive/impulsive behavior. No interaction effects were found. Our findings  suggest temperament and parental regulation as potential and independent markers  of later inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behavior.

Early experiences of insensitive caregiving and children's self-regulation:  Vagal tone as a differential susceptibility factor.	Skibo MA(1), Sturge-Apple ML(2), Suor JH(3).

Hope Family Center,  Rochester, NY, USA. (3)Department of Psychology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.	A considerable body of research has linked parenting to the development of  children's self-regulation. However, few studies have considered different  domains of self-regulation, the effects of early caregiving behaviors, and  whether or not parenting influences children equally. Towards this, the present  investigation tested how early maternal insensitivity was associated with  difficulties in children's effortful control in early childhood and their  regulation of negative emotions during the early school years. Further, we  tested whether children's resting vagal tone may operate as a susceptibility  factor, consistent with differential susceptibility models. The sample included  220 pairs of mothers and their children who were assessed at 18 months, 3.5  years and 5 years of age. Laboratory visits consisted of observational paradigms  and survey assessments. Early maternal insensitivity at 18 months of age  forecasted difficulties with effortful control at age 3.5. Moreover, effortful  control at age 3.5 was associated with greater anger, but not sadness,  regulation at age 5. Consistent with differential susceptibility, children's  resting vagal tone at 18 months of age moderated the role of early caregiving on  children's effortful control. The findings suggest that low resting vagal tone  may operate as a differential susceptibility factor in process models testing  associations between early caregiving environments and children's  self-regulation.

Anger in infancy and its implications: History of attachment in mother-child and  father-child relationships as a moderator of risk.	Brock RL(1), Kochanska G(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,Lincoln, NE,USA. (2)Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences,University of Iowa,Iowa City,  IA,USA.	Growing research has documented distinct developmental sequelae in insecure and  secure parent-child relationships, supporting a model of early attachment as  moderating future developmental processes rather than, or in addition to, a  source of direct effects. We explored maladaptive developmental implications of  infants' anger proneness in 102 community families. Anger was assessed in  infancy through observations in the Car Seat episode and parents' ratings.  Children's security with parents was assessed in the Strange Situation paradigm  at 15 months. At preschool age, child negativity (defiance and negative affect)  was observed in interactions with the parent, and at early school age,  oppositionality was rated by parents and teachers. Security was unrelated to  infant anger; however, it moderated associations between infant anger and future  maladaptive outcomes, such that highly angry infants embarked on a negative  trajectory in insecure, but not in secure, parent-child dyads. For insecure, but  not secure, mother-child dyads, infants' mother-rated anger predicted negativity  at preschool age. For insecure, but not secure, father-child dyads, infants'  anger in the Car Seat predicted father- and teacher-rated oppositional behavior  at early school age. Results highlight the developmentally complex nature of the  impact of attachment, depending on the relationship with mother versus father,  type of measure, and timing of effects.

Mediating role of depressive symptoms linking insecure attachment and disordered  eating in adolescents: A multiwave longitudinal study.	Cortés-García L(1), Viddal KR(2), Wichstrøm L(2), Senra C(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychobiology, Faculty of Psychology,  University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain. (2)Department of Psychology, NTNU Norwegian University of Science and  Technology, Trondheim, Norway.	Research has supported a link between insecure attachment and disordered eating  in adolescents; however, how this influence is exerted remains unclear. This  study explored whether depressive symptoms constitute a pathway through which  insecure attachment to parents predicts subsequent development of disordered  eating in the transition from childhood to adolescence. The study also examines  whether there are differential effects regarding the attachment figure, child's  gender, or reciprocity between variables. A community-based sample of Spanish  youth (n = 904; 49.4% girls) was followed biennially from age 10 to 16 years.  Attachment, depressive symptoms, and disordered eating were measured using the  Inventory of Parental and Peer Attachment, Children's Depression Inventory, and  Children's Eating Attitudes Test, respectively. Prospective data were analyzed  using a dynamic panel model, which accounts for unmeasured time-invariant  factors. Whereas insecure attachment to the father did not predict later  depression or disordered eating, higher insecure attachment to the mother at  ages 10 and 12 years predicted more disordered eating at ages 14 and 16 years  via increased depressive symptoms at ages 12 and 14 years. No child's  gender-specific or reverse mediational effects were found. This study suggests  that an increase in depressive symptoms might be one mechanism by which insecure  attachment exerts its influence on the development of eating disorders  symptomatology in adolescence. Intervention efforts aimed at strengthening  particularly the mother-child attachment relationship may reduce the  vulnerability to develop depressive symptoms and disordered eating.

Risk factors and temporal patterns of disordered eating differ in adolescent  boys and girls: Testing gender-specific appearance anxiety models.	Zimmer-Gembeck MJ(1), Webb HJ(1), Kerin J(1), Waters AM(1), Farrell LJ(1).	Author information: (1)School of Applied Psychology, Griffith University, Queensland, Australia.	Adolescent dieting and disordered eating (DE) are risks for clinical eating  disorders. In this five-wave longitudinal study, we tested gender-specific  models linking early risk factors to temporal patterns of DE, considering  appearance anxiety as a mediator. Participants were 384 Australian students (age  10 to 13; 45% boys) who reported their purging and skipping meals, experience  with appearance-related teasing, media pressure, and appearance anxiety. Parents  reported pubertal maturation and height/weight was measured. Gender differences  in temporal patterns of DE were found and predictive models were tested using  latent-variable growth curve and path models. Boys' DE was generally stable over  time; girls showed stability in purging but an average increase in skipping  meals. Peer teasing, media pressure, and pubertal maturation were associated  with more elevated initial DE in girls, and pubertal maturation was associated  with a steeper increase in DE. For boys, body mass index had a direct positive  association with DE. Appearance anxiety was associated with more DE, but there  was only one significant indirect effect via anxiety, which was for boys'  pubertal maturation. Findings support the dominant role of social interactions  and messages, as well as pubertal maturation, for girls' DE and the prominence  of physical risk factors for explaining boys' DE.

Linking social motivation with social skill: The role of emotion dysregulation  in autism spectrum disorder.	Neuhaus E(1), Webb SJ(1), Bernier RA(2).	Author information: (1)Center on Child Health,Behavior, and Development,Seattle Children's Research  Institute,Seattle, WA,USA. (2)Autism Center, Seattle Children's Hospital,Seattle, WA,USA.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with pervasive social deficits as  well as marked emotion dysregulation across the life span. Decreased social  motivation accounts in part for social difficulties, but factors moderating its  influence are not fully understood. In this paper, we (a) characterize social  and emotional functioning among children and adolescents with ASD, (b) explore  contributions of social motivation and emotion dysregulation to social skill,  and (c) consider biological sex and intellectual functioning as moderators of  these associations. In a sample of 2,079 children and adolescents with ASD from  the Simons Simplex Collection, we document direct effects of social motivation,  internalizing symptoms, aggression, attention problems, irritability, and  self-injurious behavior on children's social skills. Furthermore, dysregulation  in several domains moderated the association between social motivation and  social skill, suggesting a blunting effect on social motivation in the context  of emotional difficulties. Moreover, when considering only individuals with  intellectual skills in the average range or higher, biological sex further  moderated these associations. Findings add to our understanding of  social-emotional processes in ASD, suggest emotion dysregulation as a target of  intervention in the service of social skill improvements, and build on efforts  to understand sources of individual difference that contribute to heterogeneity  among individuals with ASD.

(2)Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA. (3)REACH Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA. (4)Oregon Research Institute, Eugene, OR, USA.	The confluence model theorizes that dynamic transactions between peer rejection  and deviant peer clustering amplify antisocial behavior (AB) within the school  context during adolescence. Little is known about the links between peer  rejection and AB as embedded in changing networks. Using longitudinal social  network analysis, we investigated the interplay between rejection, deviant peer  clustering, and AB in an ethnically diverse sample of students attending public  middle schools (N = 997; 52.7% boys). Adolescents completed peer nomination  reports of rejection and antisocial behavior in Grades 6-8. Results revealed  that rejection status was associated with friendship selection, and adolescents  became rejected if they were friends with others who were rejected. Youth  befriended others with similar levels of AB. Significant patterns of peer  influence were documented for AB and rejection. As hypothesized, rejected youth  with low AB were more likely to affiliate with others with high AB instead of  similarly low AB. In contrast, nonrejected youth preferred to befriend others  with similarly high or low AB. Results support an updated confluence model of a  joint interplay between rejection and AB as ecological conditions that lead to  self-organization into deviant clusters in which peer contagion on problem  behaviors operates.

Unpacking the link between socioeconomic status and behavior problems: A  second-order meta-analysis.	Korous KM(1), Causadias JM(1), Bradley RH(1), Luthar SS(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University.	Substantial evidence links socioeconomic status to internalizing and  externalizing behavior problems. However, it is unclear how these two categories  of behavior problems relate to specific components of socioeconomic status  (e.g., income, educational attainment, and occupational prestige) or overall  social status. In this study, we conducted a second-order meta-analysis to  estimate the average associations of income, education, occupation, and overall  socioeconomic status with internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and  to examine if age, sex, and race/ethnicity moderated these associations. Our  systematic search in PsycINFO, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and  ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global identified 12 meta-analyses (17%  unpublished), including approximately 474 primary studies and 327,617  participants. In relation to internalizing, we found small average associations  with income, r+ = -.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-.31, -.04], and  education, r+ = -.12, 95% CI [-.15, -.09]. In relation to externalizing, we  found smaller associations with income, r+ = -.02, 95% CI [-.15, .10],  education, r+ = -.03, 95% CI [-.16, .10], and overall socioeconomic status, r+ =  -.05, 95% CI [-.11, .01], but these CIs included zero. Only sex composition of  the samples moderated the latter association. We provide recommendations for  best practices and future research directions.

Augustyn MB(1), Thornberry TP(2), Henry KL(3).	Author information: (1)Department of Criminal Justice,University of Texas at San Antonio. (2)Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice,University of Maryland. (3)Department of Psychology,Colorado State University.	Growing evidence suggests that maltreatment is reproduced across generations as  victims of maltreatment are at an increased risk for maltreatment perpetration.  Unfortunately, little information about mediating pathways exists to provide an  explanation for why maltreatment begets maltreatment. We use the number of types  of maltreatment experienced to predict later maltreatment perpetration and then  examine two developmental pathways that may serve as bridges between  maltreatment victimization and perpetration: adolescent problem behaviors and  precocious transitions to adulthood. With prospective, longitudinal data from  the Rochester Youth Development Study, we assess the relevance of these pathways  for the number of maltreatment experiences as well as the number of maltreatment  victimization experiences by developmental period (i.e., childhood and  adolescence). Our results demonstrate a significant relationship between  maltreatment victimization and maltreatment perpetration. Adolescent delinquency  and two precocious transitions, dropping out of school and independent living,  as well as the accumulation of precocious transitions and problem behaviors,  serve as mediators of this intergenerational relationship. Furthermore, the  relationship between the number of types of maltreatment and subsequent  perpetration is primarily driven by experiences of maltreatment during  adolescence. We discuss the implications of these results and set an agenda for  the development of programs and policies to interrupt the cycle of maltreatment.

Emotion regulation deficits mediate childhood sexual abuse effects on stress  sensitization and depression outcomes.	Yaroslavsky I(1), Bush AH(1), France CM(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH, USA.	Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a notable risk factor for depressive disorders.  Though multiply determined, increased sensitivity to stress (stress  sensitization) and difficulty managing distress (emotion regulation) may reflect  two pathways by which CSA confers depression risk. However, it remains unclear  whether stress sensitization and emotion regulation deficits contribute to  depression risk independently or in a sequential manner. That is, the frequent  use of maladaptive emotion regulation responses and insufficient use of those  that attenuate distress (adaptive emotion regulation) may lead to stress  sensitization. We tested competing models of CSA, stress sensitization, and  emotion regulation to predict depression symptoms and depressive affects in  daily life among adults with and without histories of CSA. Results supported a  sequential mediation: CSA predicted greater maladaptive repertoires that, in  turn, exacerbated the effects of stress on depression symptoms. Maladaptive  responses also exacerbated the effects of daily life stress on contemporaneous  negative affect (NA) levels and their increase over time. Independent of stress  sensitization, emotion regulation deficits also mediated CSA effects on both  depressive outcomes, though the effect of maladaptive strategies was specific to  NA, and adaptive responses to positive affect. Our findings suggest that emotion  regulation deficits and stress sensitization play key intervening roles between  CSA and risk for depression.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457942000098X PMID: 33023709

Contextual risks and psychosocial outcomes among rural African American emerging  adults: A latent profile analysis.	Goings TC(1), Yu T(2), Brody GH(2).	Author information: (1)School of Social Work, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel  Hill, NC, USA. (2)Center for Family Research, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.	African American emerging adults face unique contextual risks that place them at  heightened risk for poor psychosocial outcomes. The purpose of this study was to  identify profiles of contextual risks among rural African American emerging  adults and determine how risk profiles relate to psychosocial outcomes. Our  representative sample included 667 fifth graders who live in the rural South and  were followed from preadolescence into emerging adulthood. Contextual risks were  assessed at ages 19-21 years via six indicators: perceived stress, daily stress,  community disadvantage, parent-child conflict, racial discrimination, and  childhood trauma. Four psychosocial variables were also assessed at ages 19-21  years: self-regulation, racial identity, parent support, and friend support.  Psychosocial outcomes were assessed at age 25 years: education, substance use,  future orientation, depressive symptoms, and externalizing behaviors. Latent  profile analysis results indicated that the sample could be characterized by  three patterns of contextual risk: low contextual risk, high contextual risk,  and high contextual risk-childhood trauma. Risk profiles were associated with  psychosocial outcomes, with the childhood trauma and high-risk profiles faring  worse than the low-risk profile. Further, childhood trauma was particularly  predictive of worse outcomes for emerging adults. Findings highlight the need  for research and prevention programs that mitigate the effects of contextual  risks on psychosocial outcomes for African American emerging adults in rural  areas.

The objective was to determine the longitudinal associations between  callous-unemotional (CU) and oppositional defiant (OD) behaviors from the first  to fourth grades for Spanish children. Four possible outcomes were evaluated:  (a) CU behaviors in the first grade predict increases in OD behaviors in the  fourth grade, controlling for OD behaviors in the first grade; (b) OD behaviors  in the first grade predict increases in CU behaviors in the fourth grade,  controlling for CU behaviors in the first grade; (c) both unique effects are  significant; and (d) neither unique effect is significant. A longitudinal panel  model with two latent variables (CU and OD behaviors), three sources (mothers,  fathers, teachers), and two occasions (spring of the first and fourth grades)  was used to evaluate the four possibilities among 758 (54% boys) first grade and  469 (53% boys) fourth grade Spanish children. For mother-, father-, and  teacher-reports, OD behaviors in the first grade predicted increases in CU  behaviors in the fourth grade, after controlling for CU behaviors in the first  grade, whereas CU behaviors in the first grade did not predict increases in OD  behaviors in the fourth grade, after controlling for OD behaviors in the first  grade. OD behaviors thus conferred independent vulnerability to increases in CU  behaviors 3 years later among young children.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419000221 PMID: 31018873 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Muscatell KA(1), McCormick E(1), Telzer EH(1).	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.	Adolescence is a sensitive period for sociocultural development in which facets  of social identity, including social status and race, become especially salient.  Despite the heightened importance of both social status and race during this  developmental period, no known work has examined how individual differences in  social status influence perceptions of race in adolescents. Thus, in the present  study, we investigated how both subjective social status and objective  socioeconomic status (SES) influence neural responses to race. Twenty-three  Mexican American adolescents (15 females; mean age = 17.22 years) were scanned  using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed Black and White  faces in a standard labeling task. Adolescents rated their subjective social  status in US society, while their parents responded to questions about their  educational background, occupation, and economic strain (objective SES). Results  demonstrated a negative association between subjective social status and neural  responses in the amygdala, fusiform face area, and medial prefrontal cortex when  adolescents viewed Black (relative to White) faces. In other words, adolescents  with lower subjective social status showed greater activity in neural regions  involved in processing salience, perceptual expertise, and thinking about the  minds of others when they viewed images of Black faces, suggesting enhanced  salience of race for these youth. There was no relationship between objective  SES and neural responses to the faces. Moreover, instructing participants to  focus on the gender or emotion expression on the face attenuated the  relationship between subjective social status and neural processing of race.  Together, these results demonstrate that subjective social status shapes the way  the brain responds to race, which may have implications for psychopathology.

Core beliefs in healthy youth and youth at ultra high-risk for psychosis:  Dimensionality and links to depression, anxiety, and attenuated psychotic  symptoms.	Cowan HR(1), McAdams DP(1), Mittal VA(1).	Author information: (1)Northwestern University.	Cognitive theory posits that core beliefs play an active role in developing and  maintaining symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychosis. This study sought to  comprehensively examine core beliefs, their dimensionality, and their  relationships to depression, anxiety, and attenuated psychotic symptoms in two  groups of community youth: a group at ultrahigh risk for psychosis (UHR; n = 73,  M age = 18.7) and a matched healthy comparison group (HC; n = 73, M age = 18.1).  UHR youth reported significantly more negative beliefs about self and others,  and significantly less positive beliefs about self and others. HC youth rarely  endorsed negative self-beliefs. Exploratory factor analyses found that HC  negative self-beliefs did not cohere as a single factor. We hypothesized  specific links between core beliefs and symptoms based on cognitive models of  each disorder, and tested these links through regression analyses. The results  in the HC group were consistent with the proposed models of depression and  anxiety. The results in the UHR group were consistent with proposed models of  depression and negative psychotic symptoms, somewhat consistent with a proposed  model of positive psychotic symptoms, and not at all consistent with a proposed  model of anxiety. These findings add to a growing developmental literature on  core beliefs and psychopathology, with important clinical implications.

Maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring executive function: What do we  know and what are the next steps?	Micalizzi L(1), Knopik VS(1).	Author information: (1)Rhode Island Hospital.	Children exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) exhibit  difficulties in executive function (EF) from infancy through adolescence. Due to  the developmental significance of EF as a predictor of adaptive functioning  throughout the life span, the MSDP-EF relation has clear public health  implications. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature  on the relationship between MSDP and offspring EF across development; consider  brain-based assessments, animal models, and genetically informed studies in an  effort to elucidate plausible pathways of effects; discuss implications for  prevention and intervention; and make calls to action for future research.

Childhood attachment and behavioral inhibition: Predicting intolerance of  uncertainty in adulthood.	Zdebik MA(1), Moss E(1), Bureau JF(2).	Author information: (1)University of Quebec in Montreal. (2)University of Ottawa.	Intolerance of uncertainty (IU), the tendency to react negatively to uncertain  situations, has been identified as an important cognitive component of anxiety  disorders, yet little is known about its etiology. Links to temperament,  particularly behavioral inhibition (BI), and insecure attachment have been  proposed in the development of IU, but no prospective empirical investigation  has been performed thus far. In the current study, attachment to caregiver and  BI of 60 children were assessed at age 6, using observational measures. Mother's  anxiety symptoms were assessed when participants were 14 years old. IU was  reported by participants when they were 21 years old, as was neuroticism. Two  types of insecure attachment (ambivalent and disorganized-controlling) and BI  were positively related to IU over a 15-year span, even after controlling for  participants' neuroticism and maternal anxiety. Attachment and BI had no  significant interacting effect on the development of IU. Maternal anxiety was  positively related to child BI and insecure attachment, but not IU. This study  is the first to provide empirical support for a link between ambivalent and  disorganized-controlling attachment and BI in preschool children to the  development of IU in adulthood. Results have etiological and preventative  implications not only for anxiety disorders but also for all disorders related  to IU.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417001614 PMID: 29157325 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Institutionally deprived young children often display distinctive patterns of  attachment, classified as insecure/other (INS/OTH), with their adoptive parents.  The associations between INS/OTH and developmental trajectories of mental health  and neurodevelopmental symptoms were examined. Age 4 attachment status was  determined for 97 Romanian adoptees exposed to up to 24 months of deprivation in  Romanian orphanages and 49 nondeprived UK adoptees. Autism,  inattention/overactivity and disinhibited-social-engagement symptoms, emotional  problems, and IQ were measured at 4, 6, 11, and 15 years and in young adulthood.  Romanian adoptees with over 6 months deprivation (Rom>6) were more often  classified as INS/OTH than UK and Romanian adoptees with less than 6 months  deprivation combined. INS/OTH was associated with cognitive impairment at age 4  years. The interaction between deprivation, attachment status, and age for  autism spectrum disorder assessment was significant, with greater symptom  persistence in Rom>6 INS/OTH(+) than other groups. This effect was reduced when  IQ at age 4 was controlled for. Age 4 INS/OTH in Rom>6 was associated with worse  autism spectrum disorder outcomes up to two decades later. Its association with  cognitive impairment at age 4 is consistent with INS/OTH being an early marker  of this negative developmental trajectory, rather than its cause.

Using automated computer vision and machine learning to code facial expressions  of affect and arousal: Implications for emotion dysregulation research.	Haines N(1), Bell Z(1), Crowell S(2), Hahn H(1), Kamara D(1), McDonough-Caplan  H(1), Shader T(1), Beauchaine TP(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology,Ohio State University,Columbus, OH,USA. (2)Department of Psychology,University of Utah,Salt Lake City, UT,USA.	As early as infancy, caregivers' facial expressions shape children's behaviors,  help them regulate their emotions, and encourage or dissuade their interpersonal  agency. In childhood and adolescence, proficiencies in producing and decoding  facial expressions promote social competence, whereas deficiencies characterize  several forms of psychopathology. To date, however, studying facial expressions  has been hampered by the labor-intensive, time-consuming nature of human coding.  We describe a partial solution: automated facial expression coding (AFEC), which  combines computer vision and machine learning to code facial expressions in real  time. Although AFEC cannot capture the full complexity of human emotion, it  codes positive affect, negative affect, and arousal-core Research Domain  Criteria constructs-as accurately as humans, and it characterizes emotion  dysregulation with greater specificity than other objective measures such as  autonomic responding. We provide an example in which we use AFEC to evaluate  emotion dynamics in mother-daughter dyads engaged in conflict. Among other  findings, AFEC (a) shows convergent validity with a validated human coding  scheme, (b) distinguishes among risk groups, and (c) detects developmental  increases in positive dyadic affect correspondence as teen daughters age.  Although more research is needed to realize the full potential of AFEC, findings  demonstrate its current utility in research on emotion dysregulation.

Theory of mind, the ability to represent the mental states of others, is an  important social cognitive process, which contributes to the development of  social competence. Recent research suggests that interactions between gene and  environmental factors, such as oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) polymorphisms and  maternal parenting behavior, may underlie individual differences in children's  theory of mind. However, the potential influence of DNA methylation of OXTR  remains unclear. The current study investigated the roles of OXTR methylation,  maternal behavior, and their statistical interaction on toddlers' early emerging  theory of mind abilities. Participants included a community sample of 189 dyads  of mothers and their 2- to 3-year-old children, whose salivary DNA was analyzed.  Results indicated that more maternal structuring behavior was associated with  better performance, on a battery of three theory of mind tasks, while higher  OXTR methylation within exon 3 was associated with poorer performance. A  significant interaction also emerged, such that OXTR methylation was related to  theory of mind among children whose mothers displayed less structuring, when  controlling for children's age, sex, ethnicity, number of child-aged siblings,  verbal ability, and maternal education. Maternal structuring behavior may buffer  the potential negative impact of hypermethylation on OXTR gene expression and  function.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419000257 PMID: 31030686 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

This study examined whether the interaction between parenting and inhibitory  control predicts hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention in 195 children.  Observation data of positive parenting were collected at 4 years, and mother  reports of coercive parenting at 5 years, inhibitory control at 6 years, and  hyperactivity-impulsivity/inattention at 7 years were obtained. The common and  unique variance of hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention symptoms were  examined as outcomes using a bifactor model. Results indicated that positive  parenting practices predicted lower levels of  hyperactivity-impulsivity/inattention behaviors at age 7 only when children's  inhibitory control was high. These results support the vantage sensitivity  model, which posits that some individuals show an increased sensitivity to  positive experiences exclusively, and support the appropriateness of a targeted  prevention approach in early childhood.

Interpersonal childhood adversity and stress generation in adolescence:  Moderation by HPA axis multilocus genetic variation.	Huang M(1), Starr LR(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology, University of  Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.	Research suggests that childhood adversity (CA) is associated with a wide range  of repercussions, including an increased likelihood of interpersonal stress  generation. This may be particularly true following interpersonal childhood  adversity (ICA) and for youth with high hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)  axis-related genetic risk. In the current study, we applied a multilocus genetic  profile score (MGPS) approach to measuring HPA axis-related genetic variation  and examined its interaction with ICA to predict interpersonal stress generation  in a sample of adolescents aged 14-17 (N = 241, Caucasian subsample n = 192).  MGPSs were computed using 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms from HPA  axis-related genes (CRHR1, NRC31, NRC32, and FKBP5). ICA significantly predicted  greater adolescent interpersonal dependent stress. Additionally, MGPS predicted  a stronger association between ICA and interpersonal dependent (but not  independent or noninterpersonal dependent) stress. No gene-environment  interaction (G×E) effects were found for noninterpersonal CA and MGPS in  predicting adolescent interpersonal dependent stress. Effects remained after  controlling for current depressive symptoms and following stratification by  race. Findings extend existing G×E research on stress generation to HPA  axis-related genetic variation and demonstrate effects specific to the  interpersonal domain.

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is commonly diagnosed during adolescence and is  associated with psychological stress reactivity and heightened physiological  arousal. No study, however, has systematically examined which aspects of  autonomic nervous system function mediate likely links between stress  sensitivity and social anxiety symptoms in adolescents. Here, we assessed 163  adolescents (90 females; 12.29 ± 1.39 years) with respect to life stress and  social anxiety symptoms, and measured respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and  skin conductance levels (SCL) during a psychosocial stress paradigm. We  operationalized stress sensitivity as the residual variance in subjective stress  severity after accounting for objective severity and changes in autonomic  regulation using standardized change scores in RSA and SCL. In females only,  stress sensitivity and social anxiety symptoms were significantly correlated  with each other (p < .001) and with autonomic regulation during both reactivity  and recovery (all ps < 0.04). Further, sympathetic nervous system dominance  during recovery specifically mediated associations between stress sensitivity  and social anxiety symptoms (B = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.02-2.64). In contrast, in  males, stress sensitivity, autonomic regulation during reactivity or recovery,  and social anxiety symptoms were not significantly associated (all ps > 0.1). We  interpret these results in the context of psychobiological models of SAD and  discuss implications for interventions targeting autonomic processes.

Prospective longitudinal studies of idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD)  have provided insights into early symptoms and predictors of ASD during infancy,  well before ASD can be diagnosed at age 2-3 years. However, research on the  emergence of ASD in disorders with a known genetic etiology, contextualized in a  developmental framework, is currently lacking. Using a biobehavioral multimethod  approach, we (a) determined the rate of ASD in N = 51 preschoolers with fragile  X syndrome (FXS) using a clinical best estimate (CBE) procedure with  differential diagnoses of comorbid psychiatric disorders and (b) investigated  trajectories of ASD symptoms and physiological arousal across infancy as  predictors of ASD in preschoolers with FXS. ASD was not diagnosed if  intellectual ability or psychiatric disorders better accounted for the symptoms.  Our results determined that 60.7% of preschoolers with FXS met the Diagnostic  and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth edition) (DSM-5) criteria for  ASD using the CBE procedure. In addition, 92% of these preschoolers presented  with developmental delay and 45.4% also met criteria for psychiatric disorders,  either anxiety, ADHD, or both. ASD diagnoses in preschoolers with FXS were  predicted by elevated scores on traditional ASD screeners in addition to  elevated autonomic arousal and avoidant eye contact from infancy.

Belonging to a social group is one of the most important factors contributing to  well-being. The Belonging Regulation model proposes that humans possess a social  monitoring system (SMS) that evaluates social inclusion and monitors belonging  needs. Here, we used a prospective longitudinal design to examine links between  peer victimization experienced across 7 years and social monitoring at the  behavioral and neural level in adolescent girls (n = 38, Mage = 15.43 years, SD  = .33). Participants completed a social evaluation task during a functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. More severe peer victimization was  associated with increased activation to in-group versus out-group peers in the  amygdala, ventral striatum, fusiform gyrus, and temporoparietal junction.  Moreover, participants who displayed increased activation in these regions  reported lower social self esteem and higher levels of internalizing and  externalizing symptoms. These results suggest that exposure to peer  victimization across the school years is associated with heightened social  monitoring at the neural level during adolescence, which has potential adverse  implications for girls' adjustment and well-being.

Author information: (1)Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison,Madison,WI,USA. (2)Department of Psychology,California State  University,Northridge,Northridge,CA,USA.	African American youths are overrepresented in the American juvenile justice  system relative to Caucasians. Yet, research on antisocial behaviors (ASB) has  focused on predominantly Caucasian populations. Furthermore, relatively little  is known about how environmental factors, such as supportive parenting (e.g.,  how close adolescents feel to their parent) and school connectedness (e.g., how  supported adolescents feel at school), affect trajectories of ASB in Caucasians  versus African Americans. This study mapped developmental trajectories of ASB in  Caucasians (n = 10,764) and African Americans (n = 4,091) separately, using four  waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult  Health. We then examined supportive parenting and school connectedness on the  trajectories of ASB. Four trajectories of ASB were identified for both  Caucasians and African Americans: negligible, adolescence-peaked,  low-persistence, and high-persistence ASB, although prevalence rates differed by  racial-ethnic status. Supportive parenting reduced the risk of membership into  the adolescence-peaked trajectory for both Caucasians and African Americans.  However, school connectedness was less protective for African Americans than for  Caucasians because it only predicted a lower risk of adolescence-peaked  membership for African Americans. Findings may reflect the complex social  dynamics between race and schools in the development of ASB.

(2)Counselling Psychology, Faculty of Education, University of Ottawa, Ottawa,  Canada.	Depression is associated with a multiplicity of adverse outcomes in adolescence,  including peer victimization and low self-esteem. Depressive symptoms, peer  victimization, and self-esteem are linked in cross-sectional studies, but no  longitudinal study has been conducted assessing their developmental pathways in  one integrated model across adolescence. We explored their temporal sequencing  in a normative sample of 612 Canadian adolescents (54% girls) assessed annually  over 5 years (Grade 7 to Grade 11). Potential confounders such as biological  sex, ethnicity/race, and parent income and education were statistically  controlled. We found evidence for the vulnerability model (self-esteem  predicting depression) and the symptoms-driven model (depression predicting peer  victimization). Our findings also supported the integration of these pathways  into a self-perception driven model characterized by the indirect effect of  self-esteem on later peer victimization via depressive symptoms. Specifically,  poor self-esteem initiated a developmental cascade that led to poor mood and  poor peer relations. These results highlight the importance of helping youth  form a healthy identity that promotes positive mental health and peer relations,  and the need to intervene with depressed, victimized, and at-risk adolescents to  instill positive self-regard. Our results also emphasize the central role that  self-perceptions play in the onset and maintenance of poor outcomes.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419000865 PMID: 31387662 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Communication deviance (CD) reflects features of the content or manner of a  person's speech that may confuse the listener and inhibit the establishment of a  shared focus of attention. The construct was developed in the context of the  study of familial risks for psychosis based on hypotheses regarding its effects  during childhood. It is not known whether parental CD is associated with  nonverbal parental behaviors that may be important in early development. This  study explored the association between CD in a cohort of mothers (n = 287) at 32  weeks gestation and maternal sensitivity with infants at 29 weeks in a standard  play procedure. Maternal CD predicted lower overall maternal sensitivity (B =  -.385; p < .001), and the effect was somewhat greater for sensitivity to infant  distress (B = -.514; p < .001) than for sensitivity to nondistress (B = -.311; p  < .01). After controlling for maternal age, IQ and depression, and for  socioeconomic deprivation, the associations with overall sensitivity and  sensitivity to distress remained significant.

Association of direct and indirect aggression and victimization with self-harm  in young adolescents: A person-oriented approach.	Daukantaitė D(1), Lundh LG(1), Wångby-Lundh M(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology,Lund University.	We sought to determine which patterns of direct and indirect aggression and  victimization are most clearly associated with self-harm in adolescent girls and  boys cross-sectionally at two time points, as well as prospectively over one  year. A cluster analysis using the LICUR procedure (Bergman, 1998) was employed  to identify stable patterns of aggression and victimization in a community  cohort of 883 Swedish adolescents (51% girls; mean age 14.5). The results showed  that a pattern combining high aggression with high victimization was  consistently associated with high levels of self-harm in both genders, both  cross-sectionally and prospectively. Additionally, this pattern of aggressive  victims was a clear risk factor for the development of repetitive self-harm over  a one-year period in both girls (odds ratio 13.58) and boys (odds ratio 5.72).  We also found several gender differences: In girls, subgroups characterized by  high victimization (aggressive victims and non-aggressive victims) had the  highest levels of self-harm, whereas in boys the patterns characterized by high  aggression (aggressive victims and aggressive non-victims) seemed more relevant.  The findings concerning the aggressive victim cluster are clear warning signs of  severe psychopathology and possible psychiatric diagnosis in this subgroup of  girls and boys.

A recent article in this journal reported a number of gene × environment  interactions involving a serotonin transporter-gene network polygenic score and  a composite index of prenatal adversity predicting several problem behavior  outcomes at 48 months (e.g., anxious/depressed, pervasive developmental  problems) and at 60 months (e.g., withdrawal, internalizing problems), yet did  not illuminate the nature or form these genetic × environment interactions took.  Here we report results of six additional analyses to evaluate whether these  interactions reflected diathesis-stress or differential-susceptibility related  processes. Analyses of the regions of significance and proportion of interaction  index are consistent with the diathesis-stress model, seemingly because of the  truncated nature of the adversity score (which did not extend to  supportive/positive prenatal experiences/exposures); in contrast, the proportion  (of cases) affected index favors the differential-susceptibility model. These  results suggest the need for future studies to extend measurement of the  prenatal environment to highly supportive experiences and exposures.

The unique effects of maternal and paternal depressive symptoms on youth's  symptomatology: Moderation by family ethnicity, family structure, and child  gender.

Drawing on five waves of longitudinal data from 392 families (52% female; mean  age of wave 1 [Mage_W1] = 12.89, standard deviation [SD] = .48; Mage_W5 = 21.95,  SD = .77; 199 European American and 193 Mexican American families; 217 intact  and 175 stepfather families), this study documented transactional relations of  mothers' and fathers' depressive symptoms with youth's symptomatology from early  adolescence to young adulthood. Trait and time-varying cross-lagged models  revealed that both mothers' and fathers' between- and within-person differences  in depressive symptoms were associated with youth's internalizing and  externalizing symptoms. Whereas each parent's depressive symptoms uniquely  contributed to youth's internalizing symptoms, however, only mothers' depressive  symptoms influenced youth's externalizing symptoms. Although reciprocal effects  of youth's internalizing symptoms on parents' depressive symptoms were not  significant, youth's externalizing symptoms predicted changes in mothers'  depressive symptoms over time. Moderation analyses revealed distinct  transactional patterns by family ethnicity and child gender, but not by family  structure. This study revealed dynamic transactions among family members'  symptomatology that point to opportune times and targets for intervention  efforts aimed at mitigating the negative impact of parents' depressive symptoms  on youth's adjustment.

HPA-axis multilocus genetic variation moderates associations between  environmental stress and depressive symptoms among adolescents.	Starr LR(1), Huang M(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology,University of  Rochester,Rochester, NY,USA.	Research suggests that genetic variants linked to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)-axis functioning moderate the association between environmental stressors  and depression, but examining gene-environment interactions with single  polymorphisms limits power. The current study used a multilocus genetic profile  score (MGPS) approach to measuring HPA-axis-related genetic variation and  examined interactions with acute stress, chronic stress, and childhood adversity  (assessed using contextual threat interview methods) with depressive symptoms as  outcomes in an adolescent sample (ages 14-17, N = 241; White subsample n = 192).  Additive MGPSs were calculated using 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms within  HPA-axis genes (CRHR1, NR3C2, NR3C1, FKBP5). Higher MGPS directly correlated  with adolescent depressive symptoms. Moreover, MGPS predicted stronger  associations between acute and chronic stress and adolescent depressive symptoms  and also moderated the effect of interpersonal, but not noninterpersonal,  childhood adversity. Gene-environment interactions individually accounted for  5%-8% of depressive symptom variation. All results were retained following  multiple test correction and stratification by race. Results suggest that using  MGPSs provides substantial power to examine gene-environmental interactions  linked to affective outcomes among adolescents.

Resting state coupling between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex  is related to household income in childhood and indexes future psychological  vulnerability to stress.

While child poverty is a significant risk factor for poor mental health, the  developmental pathways involved with these associations are poorly understood.  To advance knowledge about these important linkages, the present study examined  the developmental sequelae of childhood exposure to poverty in a multiyear  longitudinal study. Here, we focused on exposure to poverty, neurobiological  circuitry connected to emotion dysregulation, later exposure to stressful life  events, and symptoms of psychopathology. We grounded our work in a  biopsychosocial perspective, with a specific interest in "stress sensitization"  and emotion dysregulation. Motivated by past work, we first tested whether  exposure to poverty was related to changes in the resting-state coupling between  two brain structures centrally involved with emotion processing and regulation  (the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex; vmPFC). As predicted, we  found lower household income at age 10 was related to lower resting-state  coupling between these areas at age 15. We then tested if variations in  amygdala-vmPFC connectivity interacted with more contemporaneous stressors to  predict challenges with mental health at age 16. In line with past reports  showing risk for poor mental health is greatest in those exposed to early and  then later, more contemporaneous stress, we predicted and found that lower  vmPFC-amygdala coupling in the context of greater contemporaneous stress was  related to higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. We believe  these important interactions between neurobiology and life history are an  additional vantage point for understanding risk and resiliency, and suggest  avenues for prediction of psychopathology related to early life challenge.

Early magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers of schizophrenia spectrum disorders:  Toward a fetal imaging perspective.	Hayat TTA(1), Sami MB(2).	Author information: (1)Division of Clinical Neuroscience, School of Medicine, University of  Nottingham, Nottingham, UK. (2)Institute of Mental Health, Jubilee Campus, University of Nottingham,  Innovation Park, Nottingham, UK.	There is mounting evidence to implicate the intrauterine environment as the  initial pathogenic stage for neuropsychiatric disease. Recent developments in  magnetic resonance imaging technology are making a multimodal analysis of the  fetal central nervous system a reality, allowing analysis of structural and  functional parameters. Exposures to a range of pertinent risk factors whether  preconception or in utero can now be indexed using imaging techniques within the  fetus' physiological environment. This approach may determine the first "hit"  required for diseases that do not become clinically manifest until adulthood,  and which only have subtle clinical markers during childhood and adolescence. A  robust characterization of a "multi-hit" hypothesis may necessitate a  longitudinal birth cohort; within this investigative paradigm, the full range of  genetic and environmental risk factors can be assessed for their impact on the  early developing brain. This will lay the foundation for the identification of  novel biomarkers and the ability to devise methods for early risk stratification  and disease prevention. However, these early markers must be followed over time:  first, to account for neural plasticity, and second, to assess the effects of  postnatal exposures that continue to drive the individual toward disease. We  explore these issues using the schizophrenia spectrum disorders as an  illustrative paradigm. However, given the potential richness of fetal magnetic  resonance imaging, and the likely overlap of biomarkers, these concepts may  extend to a range of neuropsychiatric conditions.

When conflict escalates into intimate partner violence: The delicate nature of  observed coercion in adolescent romantic relationships.	Ha T(1), Kim H(2), McGill S(3).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA. (2)Department of Psychological, Health & Learning Sciences, University of  Houston, Houston, TX, USA. (3)Oregon Research Institute, Eugene, OR, USA.	We investigated how initial conflicts in adolescent romantic relationships  escalate into serious forms of conflict, including intimate partner violence  (IPV). We focused on whether adolescents' micro-level interaction patterns,  i.e., coercion and positive engagement, mediated between conflict and future  IPV. The sample consisted of 91 heterosexual couples, aged 13 to 18 years (M =  16.5, SD = 0.99) from a diverse background (42% Hispanic/Latino, 42% White).  Participants completed surveys about conflict at Time 1, and they participated  in videotaped conflict and jealousy discussions. At Time 2, participants  completed surveys about conflict and IPV, and an average daily conflict score  was calculated from ecological momentary assessments. Multilevel hazard models  revealed that we did not find support for dyadic coercion as a risk process  leading to escalations in conflict. However, a higher likelihood of ending  dyadic positive behaviors mediated between earlier levels of conflict and a  latent construct of female conflict and IPV. Classic coercive dynamics may not  apply to adolescent romantic relationships. Instead, not being able to reinforce  levels of positivity during conflict predicted conflict and IPV as reported by  females. The implications of these findings for understanding coercion in the  escalation from conflict to IPV in adolescent romantic relationships are  discussed.

Breastfeeding continuation at 6 weeks postpartum remediates the negative effects  of prenatal intimate partner violence on infant temperament.	Miller-Graff L(1), Scheid CR(2).	Author information: (1)Assistant Professor of Psychology and Peace Studies, Department of  Psychology, Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, University of Notre  Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA. (2)Department of Psychology, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA.	Very little work has examined potential moderating effects in the link between  prenatal intimate partner violence (IPV) and infant adjustment, especially in  the first critical weeks following delivery. The current study evaluated the  protective role of breastfeeding in the relationship between prenatal IPV and  infant temperament at 4 months. Pregnant women (n = 82) were interviewed during  pregnancy and at 6 weeks and 4 months postpartum. It was hypothesized that (a)  prenatal IPV would predict infant temperament outcomes at the 4-month postpartum  visit, and (b) breastfeeding continuation at 6 weeks acts as a protective factor  such that breastfed infants will be less affected by the risk posed by prenatal  IPV. Results indicated direct and negative effects of prenatal IPV on positive  affectivity/surgency and orienting/regulatory capacity at 4 months. A  significant moderating effect of breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum was  identified. Mothers who were not breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum  demonstrated the expected negative relationship between prenatal IPV exposure  and infant adjustment, but if mothers were breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum,  the relationship between IPV exposure and infant positive affectivity/surgency  and orienting/regulatory capacity was not significantly different from zero.  Results indicate a significant protective effect of breastfeeding in the  intergenerational transmission of risk for infants born to mothers exposed to  IPV.

Informant-specific reports of peer and teacher relationships buffer the effects  of harsh parenting on children's oppositional defiant disorder during  kindergarten.	Roubinov DS(1), Boyce WT(1), Bush NR(1).	Author information: (1)Departments of Psychiatry and Pediatrics, University of California, San  Francisco.	Harsh and restrictive parenting are well-established contributors to the  development of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) among children. However, few  studies have explored whether interpersonal relationships that develop outside  the family environment attenuate the risk for ODD that is associated with harsh  parenting. The current study tested multireporter measures of teacher-child  closeness and peer acceptance as moderators of the association between harsh  parenting and children's ODD as children's social worlds widen during the  kindergarten year (N = 338 children, 48% girls, M age = 5.32 years). Harsh  parenting interacted with peer nominations of peer acceptance and children's  report of teacher-child closeness to predict children's ODD symptoms in the  spring, adjusting for fall symptoms. Children exposed to harsh parenting  exhibited greater symptom increases when they were less liked/accepted playmates  and in the context of lower teacher-child closeness. However, harsh parenting  was not associated with symptom change among children with higher levels of  peer-nominated acceptance and those who reported closer relationships with  teachers. There were no significant interactions using teacher's report of peer  acceptance or teacher's report of teacher-child closeness. Findings highlight  positive peer and teacher relationships as promising targets of intervention  among children exposed to harsh parenting and support the importance of  assessing multiple perspectives of children's social functioning.

Childhood maltreatment affects adolescent sensitivity to parenting and close  friendships in predicting growth in externalizing behavior.	Tung I(1), Noroña AN(1), Lee SS(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology,University of California,Los Angeles.	Childhood maltreatment robustly predicts adolescent externalizing behaviors (EB;  e.g., violence, delinquency, substance use) and may crystalize patterns of EB by  influencing sensitivity to the social environment (e.g., parenting,  friendships). In a nationally representative sample of 9,421 adolescents, we  modeled latent growth curves of EB from age 13 to 32 years. Next, we explored  whether maltreated youth differed from nonmaltreated youth in their sensitivity  to parental closeness, friendship involvement, and polymorphisms from dopamine  genes linked to EB (dopamine receptors D2 and D4, dopamine transporter).  Overall, maltreated youth had significantly higher levels of EB across  adolescence and adulthood; however, maltreated and nonmaltreated youth showed  similar patterns of EB change over time: violent behavior decreased in  adolescence before stabilizing in adulthood, whereas nonviolent delinquency and  substance use increased in adolescence before decreasing in the transition to  adulthood. Maltreatment reduced sensitivity to parental closeness and friendship  involvement, although patterns varied based on type of EB outcome. Finally, none  of the environmental effects on EB were significantly moderated by the dopamine  polygenic risk score after accounting for multiple testing. These findings  underline the enduring effects of early maltreatment and implicate that  maltreatment may contribute to long-term risk for EB by influencing children's  sensitivity to social relationship factors in adolescence.

If performance goals (i.e., motivation to prove ability) increase children's  vulnerability to depression (Dykman, 1998), why are they overlooked in the  psychopathology literature? Evidence has relied on self-report or observational  methods and has yet to articulate how this vulnerability unfolds across levels  of analysis implicated in stress-depression linkages; for example,  hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis (HPA), sympathetic nervous system (SNS).  Utilizing a multiple-levels-of-analysis approach (Cicchetti, 2010), this  experimental study tested Dykman's goal orientation model of depression  vulnerability in a community sample of preadolescents (N = 121, Mage = 10.60  years, Range = 9.08-12.00 years, 51.6% male). Self-reports of performance goals,  attachment security, and subjective experience of internalizing difficulties  were obtained in addition to objective behavioral (i.e., task persistence) and  physiologic arousal (i.e., salivary cortisol, skin conductance level) responses  to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and two randomly assigned coping  conditions: avoidance, distraction. Children with performance goals reported  greater internalizing difficulties and exhibited more dysregulated TSST  physiologic responses (i.e., HPA hyperreactivity, SNS protracted recovery), yet  unexpectedly displayed greater TSST task persistence and more efficient  physiologic recovery during avoidance relative to distraction. These  associations were stronger and nonsignificant in the context of insecure and  secure attachment, respectively. Findings illustrate a complex matrix of  in-the-moment, integrative psychobiological relationships linking performance  goals to depression vulnerability.

The present study examined the effect of early life stress (ELS) on the  glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) methylation, the associations between NR3C1  methylation and behavior problems, and the effect of the program Parents as  Teachers (PAT) on NR3C1 methylation. Participants included 132 children, 72  assigned to the PAT intervention group and 60 to the PAT control group. Children  were aged 3 years, and were living in psychosocially at-risk families. We  assessed NR3C1 methylation of the NGFI-A binding regions of exon 1F via sodium  bisulfite sequencing from saliva DNA. Results indicated that (a) children living  in families receiving PAT had decreased methylation at one single  cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) site; (b) current maternal depressive  symptoms and parental disagreement were predictive of increased methylation of  mean NGFI-A and three single CpG sites; and (c) increased methylation of mean  NGFI-A and one single CpG site was significantly associated with increased  internalizing and externalizing symptoms. In addition, mean NGFI-A was a  mediator of the association between parental disagreement and a child's  affective problems. These results suggest that PAT may contribute to preventing  NR3C1 methylation in preschool children living in psychosocially at-risk  situations, and confirm previous findings on the associations between ELS, NR3C1  methylation, and behavior problems.

The study examined (a) whether alcohol use subgroups could be identified among  African Americans assessed from adolescence through early adulthood, and (b)  whether subgroup membership was associated with the interaction between  internalizing symptoms and antisocial behavior polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and  environmental characteristics (i.e., parental monitoring, community  disadvantage). Participants (N = 436) were initially recruited for an elementary  school-based prevention trial in a Mid-Atlantic city. Youths reported on the  frequency of their past year alcohol use from ages 14-26. DNA was obtained from  participants at age 21. Internalizing symptoms and antisocial behavior PRSs were  created based on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by Benke et  al. (2014) and Tielbeek et al. (2017), respectively. Parental monitoring and  community disadvantage were assessed at age 12. Four classes of past year  alcohol use were identified: (a) early-onset, increasing; (b) late-onset,  moderate use; (c) low steady; and (d) early-onset, decreasing. In high community  disadvantaged settings, participants with a higher internalizing symptoms PRS  were more likely to be in the early-onset, decreasing class than the low steady  class. When exposed to elevated community disadvantage, participants with a  higher antisocial behavior PRS were more likely to be in the early-onset,  increasing class than the early-onset, decreasing and late-onset, moderate use  classes.

Facial movements of others during verbal and social interaction are often too  rapid to be faced and/or processed in time by numerous children and adults with  autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which could contribute to their face-to-face  interaction peculiarities. We wish here to measure the effect of reducing the  speed of one's facial dynamics on the visual exploration of the face by children  with ASD. Twenty-three children with ASD and 29 typically-developing control  children matched for chronological age passively viewed a video of a speaker  telling a story at various velocities, i.e., a real-time speed and two  slowed-down speeds. The visual scene was divided into four areas of interest  (AOI): face, mouth, eyes, and outside the face. With an eye-tracking system, we  measured the percentage of total fixation duration per AOI and the number and  mean duration of the visual fixations made on each AOI. In children with ASD,  the mean duration of visual fixations on the mouth region, which correlated with  their verbal level, increased at slowed-down velocity compared with the  real-time one, a finding which parallels a result also found in the control  children. These findings strengthen the therapeutic potential of slowness for  enhancing verbal and language abilities in children with ASD.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000292 PMID: 32378498

Exposure to maternal depressive symptoms and growth in adolescent substance use:  The mediating role of delay discounting.

(2)Cofrin Logan Center for Addiction Research and Treatment and Department of  Psychology, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA. (3)Department of Psychology, University of Maryland, Flint, MI, USA.	Maternal depression is associated with instability within the family environment  and increases in offspring substance use across adolescence. Rates of delay  discounting, or the tendency to select smaller rewards that are immediately  available relative to larger, but delayed rewards, are also associated with  steeper increases in substance use among youth. Moreover, recent research  suggests that early unstable environments may reinforce youths' propensity  towards opportunistic decision making and delay discounting specifically. The  current prospective, longitudinal study examined links between maternal  depressive symptoms, adolescent delay discounting, and subsequent substance use.  Participants included 247 adolescents and their mothers who were assessed  annually over a 6-year period (from ages 13 to 19 years). Results supported a  small but significant mediation effect. Specifically, maternal depressive  symptoms predicted increases in adolescent delay discounting, which, in turn,  predicted steeper increases in adolescent substance use over time. Thus, youth  decision making may represent a mechanism linking maternal depression and  adolescent risk behaviors. Findings indicate the potential for interventions  targeting parental psychopathology to prevent subsequent adolescent substance  use.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000486 PMCID: PMC7725925 PMID: 32519638

Here we evaluate whether infant difficult temperament (6 months) functions as a  vulnerability or more general plasticity factor when investigating effects of  early-childhood parenting (8-42 months) on both positive and negative  early-adolescent socioemotional development (age 8-11 years). Using data from  the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 14,541) and a  re-parameterized model-testing approach to distinguish alternative person ×  environment conceptual models, results indicated that temperament × parenting  interacted in predicting externalizing (i.e., hyperactivity, conduct problems),  but not other behavior (i.e., emotional symptoms, peer problems), in a (weak)  differential susceptibility manner. While more and less supportive parenting  predicted, respectively, fewer and more behavior problems, it did so more  strongly for children who were more difficult as infants.

(3)University of Iowa.	Parent-child relationships have long-term effects on health, particularly later  inflammation and depression. We hypothesized that these effects would be  mediated by later romantic partner relationships and elevated stressors in young  adulthood, helping promote chronic, low grade, inflammation as well as  depressive symptoms, and driving their covariation. It has been proposed  recently that youth experiencing harsher parenting may also develop a stronger  association between inflammation and depressive symptoms in adulthood and  altered effects of stressors on outcomes. In the current investigation, we test  these ideas using an 18-year longitudinal study of N = 413 African American  youth that provides assessment of the parent-child relationship (at age 10),  pro-inflammatory cytokine profile and depressive symptoms (at age 28), and  potential mediators in early young adulthood (assessed at ages 21 and 24). As  predicted, the effect of harsher parent-child relationships (age 10) on  pro-inflammatory state and increased depressive symptoms at age 28 were fully  mediated through young adult stress and romantic partner relationships. In  addition, beyond these mediated effects, parent-child relationships at age 10  moderated the concurrent association between inflammation and depressive  symptoms, as well as the prospective association between romantic partner  relationships and inflammation, and resulted in substantially different patterns  of indirect effects from young adult mediators to outcomes. The results support  theorizing that the association of depression and inflammation in young  adulthood is conditional on earlier parenting, and suggest incorporating this  perspective into models predicting long-term health outcomes.

Tuning of brain-autonomic coupling by prior threat exposure: Implications for  internalizing problems in Mexican-origin adolescents.	Weissman DG(1), Guyer AE(2), Ferrer E(3), Robins RW(3), Hastings PD(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology,Harvard University,Cambridge,MA,USA. (2)Center for Mind and Brain,University of California-Davis,Davis,CA,USA. (3)Department of Psychology,University of California-Davis,Davis,CA,USA.	Exposure to threat increases the risk for internalizing problems in adolescence.  Deficits in integrating bodily cues into representations of emotion are thought  to contribute to internalizing problems. Given the role of the medial prefrontal  cortex in regulating bodily responses and integrating them into representations  of emotional states, coordination between activity in the medial prefrontal  cortex and autonomic nervous system responses may be influenced by past threat  exposure with consequences for the emergence of internalizing problems. A sample  of 179 Mexican-origin adolescents (88 female) reported on neighborhood and  school crime, peer victimization, and discrimination when they were 10-16 years  old. At age 17, participants underwent a functional neuroimaging scan during  which they viewed pictures of emotional faces while respiratory sinus arrhythmia  (RSA) and skin conductance responses were measured. Adolescents also reported  symptoms of internalizing problems. Greater exposure to threats across  adolescence was associated with more internalizing problems. Threat exposure was  also associated with stronger negative coupling between the ventromedial  prefrontal cortex and RSA. Stronger negative ventromedial prefrontal cortex-RSA  coupling was associated with fewer internalizing problems. These results suggest  the degree of coordinated activity between the brain and parasympathetic nervous  system is both enhanced by threat experiences and decreased in adolescents with  more internalizing problems.

To understand how exposure to victimization during adolescence and the presence  of comorbid psychological conditions influence substance use treatment entry and  substance use disorder diagnosis from 14 to 25 years old among serious juvenile  offenders, this study included 1,354 serious juvenile offenders who were  prospectively followed over 7 years. Growth mixture modeling was used to assess  profiles of early victimization during adolescence (14-17 years). Discrete time  survival mixture analysis was used to assess time to treatment entry and  substance use disorder diagnosis. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major  depressive disorder (MDD) were used as predictors of survival time. Mixture  models revealed three profiles of victimization: sustained poly-victimization,  moderate/decreasing victimization, and low victimization. Youth in the sustained  poly-victimization class were more likely to enter treatment earlier and have a  substance use diagnosis earlier than other classes. PTSD was a significant  predictor of treatment entry for youth in the sustained poly-victimization  class, and MDD was a significant predictor of substance use disorder diagnosis  for youth in the moderate/decreasing victimization class. Therefore, substance  use prevention programming targeted at youth experiencing poly-victimization in  early adolescence-especially those who have PTSD or MDD-is needed.

School age effects of minding the baby-An attachment-based home-visiting  intervention-On parenting and child behaviors.

(2)Yale School of Nursing, New Haven, CT, USA.	Multiple interventions have been developed to improve the caregiver-child  relationship as a buffer to the effects of early life adversity and toxic  stress. However, relatively few studies have evaluated the long-term effects of  these early childhood interventions, particularly on parenting and childhood  behaviors. Here we describe the early school-age follow-up results of a  randomized controlled trial of Minding the Baby ® (MTB), a reflective,  attachment-based, trauma-informed, preventive home-visiting intervention for  first-time mothers and their infants. Results indicate that mothers who  participated in MTB are less likely to show impaired mentalizing compared to  control mothers two to eight years after the intervention ended. Additionally,  MTB mothers have lower levels of hostile and coercive parenting, and their  children have lower total and externalizing problem behavior scores when  compared to controls at follow-up. We discuss our findings in terms of their  contribution to understanding the long-term parenting and childhood  socio-emotional developmental effects of early preventive interventions for  stressed populations.

Effects of stresses associated with extremely preterm birth may be biologically  "recorded" in the genomes of individuals born preterm via changes in DNA  methylation (DNAm) patterns. Genome-wide DNAm profiles were examined in buccal  epithelial cells from 45 adults born at extremely low birth weight (ELBW; ≤1000  g) in the oldest known cohort of prospectively followed ELBW survivors (Mage =  32.35 years, 17 male), and 47 normal birth weight (NBW; ≥2500 g) control adults  (Mage = 32.43 years, 20 male). Sex differences in DNAm profiles were found in  both birth weight groups, but they were greatly enhanced in the ELBW group  (77,895 loci) versus the NBW group (3,424 loci), suggesting synergistic effects  of extreme prenatal adversity and sex on adult DNAm profiles. In men, DNAm  profiles differed by birth weight group at 1,354 loci on 694 unique genes. Only  two loci on two genes distinguished between ELBW and NBW women. Gene ontology  (GO) and network analyses indicated that loci differentiating between ELBW and  NBW men were abundant in genes within biological pathways related to neuronal  development, synaptic transportation, metabolic regulation, and cellular  regulation. Findings suggest increased sensitivity of males to long-term  epigenetic effects of extremely preterm birth. Group differences are discussed  in relation to particular gene functions.

Identifying the mechanisms linking early experiences, genetic risk factors, and  their interaction with later health consequences is central to the development  of preventive interventions and identifying potential boundary conditions for  their efficacy. In the current investigation of 412 African American adolescents  followed across a 20-year period, we examined change in body mass index (BMI)  across adolescence as one possible mechanism linking childhood adversity and  adult health. We found associations of childhood adversity with objective  indicators of young adult health, including a cardiometabolic risk index, a  methylomic aging index, and a count of chronic health conditions. Childhood  adversities were associated with objective indicators indirectly through their  association with gains in BMI across adolescence and early adulthood. We also  found evidence of an association of genetic risk with weight gain across  adolescence and young adult health, as well as genetic moderation of childhood  adversity's effect on gains in BMI, resulting in moderated mediation. These  patterns indicated that genetic risk moderated the indirect pathways from  childhood adversity to young adult health outcomes and childhood adversity  moderated the indirect pathways from genetic risk to young adult health outcomes  through effects on weight gain during adolescence and early adulthood.

(2)University of California,Davis.	A common theory of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptom onset includes  toddlers who do not display symptoms until well after age 2, which are termed  late-onset ASD cases. Objectives were to analyze differences in clinical  phenotype between toddlers identified as ASD at initial evaluations (early  diagnosed) versus those initially considered nonspectrum, then later identified  as ASD (late diagnosed). Two hundred seventy-three toddlers recruited from the  general population based on a failed developmental screening form or parent or  physician concerns were followed longitudinally from 12 months and identified as  early- and late-diagnosed cases of ASD, language delayed, or typically  developing. Toddlers completed common standardized assessments and experimental  eye-tracking and observational measures every 9-12 months until age 3.  Longitudinal performance on standardized assessments and experimental tests from  initial evaluations were compared. Delay in social communication skills was seen  in both ASD groups at early-age initial assessment, including increased  preference for nonsocial stimuli, increased stereotypic play, reduced  exploration, and use of gestures. On standardized psychometric assessments,  early-diagnosed toddlers showed more impairment initially while late-diagnosed  toddlers showed a slowing in language acquisition. Similar social communication  impairments were present at very early ages in both early-detected ASD and  so-called late-onset ASD. Data indicate ASD is present whether detected or not  by current methods, and development of more sensitive tools is needed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417001067 PMID: 28803559 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Associations between classroom climate and children's externalizing symptoms:  The moderating effect of kindergarten children's parasympathetic reactivity.

(2)Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San  Francisco, CA, USA. (3)Department of Psychology, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, CA,  USA.	Classrooms are key social settings that impact children's mental health, though  individual differences in physiological reactivity may render children more or  less susceptible to classroom environments. In a diverse sample of children from  19 kindergarten classrooms (N = 338, 48% female, M age = 5.32 years), we  examined whether children's parasympathetic reactivity moderated the association  between classroom climate and externalizing symptoms. Independent observers  coded teachers' use of child-centered and teacher-directed instructional  practices across classroom social and management domains. Children's respiratory  sinus arrhythmia reactivity to challenge tasks was assessed in fall and a  multi-informant measure of externalizing was collected in fall and spring. Both  the social and the management domains of classroom climate significantly  interacted with children's respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity to predict  spring externalizing symptoms, controlling for fall symptoms. For more reactive  children, as classrooms shifted toward greater proportional use of  child-centered methods, externalizing symptoms declined, whereas greater use of  teacher-dominated practices was associated with increased symptoms. Conversely,  among less reactive children, exposure to more teacher-dominated classroom  management practices was associated with lower externalizing. Consistent with  the theory of biological sensitivity to context, considering variability in  children's physiological reactivity aids understanding of the salience of the  classroom environment for children's mental health.

(2)University of Konstanz.	Recent proposals suggest early adversity sets in motion particularly chronic and  neurobiologically distinct trajectories of internalizing symptoms. However, few  prospective studies in high-risk samples delineate distinct trajectories of  internalizing symptoms from preschool age onward. We examined trajectories in a  high-risk cohort, oversampled for internalizing symptoms, several preschool  risk/maintenance factors, and school-age outcomes. Parents of 325 children  completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire on up to four waves of  data collection from preschool (3-5 years) to school age (8-9 years) and  Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment interviews at both ages. Multi-informant  data were collected on risk factors and symptoms. Growth mixture modelling  identified four trajectory classes of internalizing symptoms with stable low,  rising low-to-moderate, stable moderate, and stable high symptoms. Children in  the stable high symptom trajectory manifested clinically relevant internalizing  symptoms, mainly diagnosed with anxiety disorders/depression at preschool and  school age. Trajectories differed regarding loss/separation experience,  maltreatment, maternal psychopathology, temperament, and stress-hormone  regulation with loss/separation, temperament, maternal psychopathology, and  stress-hormone regulation (trend) significantly contributing to explained  variance. At school age, trajectories continued to differ on symptoms,  disorders, and impairment. Our study is among the first to show that severe  early adversity may trigger a chronic and neurobiologically distinct  internalizing trajectory from preschool age onward.

Self-regulation is considered a major predictor of crime and deviant behavior.  However, longitudinal research investigating these associations, frequently  looked only at the effect of self-regulation on deviant behavior, but not the  other way around. The current study argued that deviance may contribute to later  problems in self-regulation, and examined bidirectional associations, comparing  a unidirectional and bidirectional model of associations between these  variables. A Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model and eight data waves from  772 participants, aged 10-12 years to 30 years were used. Results showed that a  bidirectional model fit the data better than a unidirectional model. The final  model revealed an influence of deviance on self-regulation mainly in  adolescence, whereas self-regulation influenced deviance only over two time  points in adulthood. The results suggest that, in adolescence, problems in  self-regulation may follow, rather than precede deviant behavior. Thus,  decreasing deviant behavior or intervening in the aftermaths of deviant behavior  in adolescence might have a positive effect on self-regulation in young  adulthood, lowering the chance of adult deviant behavior. The current study  shows that the long-presumed directionality of self-regulation to deviance can  lead to bias, and more rigorous longitudinal research is needed in order to  further inform theory and practice.

Stroud LR(1), McCallum M(1), Salisbury AL(1).	Author information: (1)Brown University.	Despite recent emphasis on the profound importance of the fetal environment in  "programming" postnatal development, measurement of offspring development  typically begins after birth. Using a novel coding strategy combining direct  fetal observation via ultrasound and actocardiography, we investigated the  impact of maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) on fetal neurobehavior; we  also investigated links between fetal and infant neurobehavior. Participants  were 90 pregnant mothers and their infants (52 MSDP-exposed; 51% minorities;  ages 18-40). Fetal neurobehavior at baseline and in response to vibro-acoustic  stimulus was assessed via ultrasound and actocardiography at M = 35 weeks  gestation and coded via the Fetal Neurobehavioral Assessment System (FENS).  After delivery, the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale was administered up to  seven times over the first postnatal month. MSDP was associated with increased  fetal activity and fetal limb movements. Fetal activity, complex body movements,  and cardiac-somatic coupling were associated with infants' ability to attend to  stimuli and to self-regulate over the first postnatal month. Furthermore,  differential associations emerged by MSDP group between fetal activity, complex  body movements, quality of movement, and coupling, and infant attention and  self-regulation. The present study adds to a growing literature establishing the  validity of fetal neurobehavioral measures in elucidating fetal programming  pathways.

Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2019 Oct;31(4):1599.	A great deal of research has focused on acculturation and enculturation, which  represent the processes of adapting to a new culture. Despite this growing  literature, results have produced inconsistent findings that may be attributable  to differences in terms of the instruments used to assess acculturation and  enculturation. Utilizing a 3-year longitudinal data set (with 1-year lags  between assessments), the present study explored the psychometric properties of  the Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire-Short Version (BIQ-S) and the  Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans II (ARSMA-II) and examined the  overlap between changes in these measures as they relate to internalizing and  externalizing problem behavior. The present sample consisted of 216 immigrant  Latino youth (43% boys; mean age 13.6 years at baseline; SD = 1.44 years, range  10 to 17). Exploratory structural equation modeling identified factor structures  for the BIQ-S and ARSMA-II that diverged from their hypothesized structure.  Growth curve models also indicate divergence between the BIQ-S and ARSMA-II in  terms of change in acculturation and enculturation processes. Finally, the  present findings emphasized that measures of acculturation and enculturation are  not equivalent in terms of their effects on internalizing and externalizing  problems.

Hope Family Center, Rochester, New York.	Utilizing a large (N = 739), ancestrally homogenous sample, the current study  aimed to better understand biological risk processes involved in the development  of depressive symptoms in maltreated, African American children age 8-12 years.  Maltreatment was independently coded from Child Protective Services records and  maternal report. Self-reported depressive symptoms were attained in the context  of a week-long, summer research camp. DNA was acquired from buccal cell or  saliva samples and genotyped for nine polymorphisms in four  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis-related genes: FKBP5, NR3C1, NR3C2,  and CRHR1. Salivary cortisol samples were collected each morning (9 a.m.) and  late afternoon (4 p.m.) throughout the week to assess HPA functioning. Results  revealed that experiences of maltreatment beginning prior to age 5 were most  predictive of depressive symptoms, whereas maltreatment onset after age 5 was  most predictive of HPA axis dysregulation (blunted daytime cortisol patterns).  Multigenic risk did not relate to HPA functioning, nor did it moderate the  relationship between maltreatment and HPA activity. There was no mediation of  the relationship between maltreatment and depressive symptoms by HPA  dysfunction. Results are interpreted through a developmental psychopathology  lens, emphasizing the principle of equifinality while carefully appraising  racial differences. Implications for future research, particularly the need for  longitudinal studies, and important methodological considerations are discussed.

One size does not fit all: Links between shift-and-persist and asthma in youth  are moderated by perceived social status and experience of unfair treatment.	Lam PH(1), Miller GE(1), Chiang JJ(1), Levine CS(1), Le V(1), Shalowitz MU(2),  Story RE(2), Chen E(1).	Author information: (1)Northwestern University. (2)NorthShore University HealthSystem.	The links between low socioeconomic status and poor health are well established,  yet despite adversity, some individuals with low socioeconomic status appear to  avoid these negative consequences through adaptive coping. Previous research  found a set of strategies, called shift-and-persist (shifting the self to  stressors while persisting by finding meaning), to be particularly adaptive for  individuals with low socioeconomic status, who typically face more  uncontrollable stressors. This study tested (a) whether perceived social status,  similar to objective socioeconomic status, would moderate the link between  shift-and-persist and health, and (b) whether a specific uncontrollable  stressor, unfair treatment, would similarly moderate the health correlates of  shift-and-persist. A sample of 308 youth (Meanage = 13.0, range 8-17), physician  diagnosed with asthma, completed measures of shift-and-persist, unfair  treatment, asthma control, and quality of life in the lab, and 2 weeks of daily  diaries about their asthma symptoms. Parents reported on perceived family social  status. Results indicated that shift-and-persist was associated with better  asthma profiles, only among youth from families with lower (vs. higher)  parent-reported perceived social status. Shift-and-persist was also associated  with better asthma profiles, only among youth who experienced more (vs. less)  unfair treatment.

The effects of psychoactive substance abuse are not limited to the user, but  extend to the entire family system, with children of substance abusers being  particularly at risk. This meta-analysis attempted to quantify the longitudinal  relationship between parental alcohol, tobacco, and drug use and child  well-being, investigating variation across a range of substance and well-being  indices and other potential moderators. We performed a literature search of  peer-reviewed, English language, longitudinal observational studies that  reported outcomes for children aged 0 to 18 years. In total, 56 studies,  yielding 220 dependent effect sizes, met inclusion criteria. A multilevel  random-effects model revealed a statistically significant, small detriment to  child well-being for parental substance abuse over time (r = .15). Moderator  analyses demonstrated that the effect was more pronounced for parental drug use  (r = .25), compared with alcohol use (r = .13), tobacco use (r = .13), and  alcohol use disorder (r = .14). Results highlight a need for future studies that  better capture the effect of parental psychoactive substance abuse on the full  breadth of childhood well-being outcomes and to integrate substance abuse into  models that specify the precise conditions under which parental behavior  determines child well-being.Registration: PROSPERO CRD42017076088.

(2)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN,  USA.	Maltreatment during childhood is associated with difficult interpersonal  relationships throughout the life course. The aim of the current study was to  investigate differential pathways from child maltreatment to emerging adult  relationship dysfunction. Specifically, we prospectively tested whether child  maltreatment initiates a developmental cascade resulting in coercive negative  romantic and friend interactions in emerging adulthood via childhood antisocial  tendencies and via childhood relational aggression. Utilizing a longitudinal  sample of emerging adult participants (N = 392; mean age = 20 years old) who  took part in a summer research camp program as children (mean age = 11 years  old), results supported pathways via both childhood antisocial behavior and  childhood relational aggression. We found specificity within these pathways such  that childhood antisocial behavior was a mediator of child maltreatment effects  on emerging adult negative romantic interactions, whereas childhood relational  aggression was a mediator of child maltreatment effects on emerging adult  negative friend interactions. Taken together, results indicate that children  exposed to maltreatment face significant interpersonal challenges in emerging  adulthood, within both the friend and the romantic domains, and point to  distinct childhood pathways to these negative interactions. Our findings are  consistent with Dishion's (2016) theoretical framework for understanding the  development of coercion in relationships and highlight the criticality of early  intervention with maltreating families.

By a process called deviancy training, peers  can both model and reinforce these behaviors, thereby conveying group norms  about the acceptability of such behaviors. This research examined the  relationship between the proportion of adolescents' peers who exchanged  antisocial text messages and externalizing behaviors during high school. In  Study 1, parent-, teacher-, and self-reports of rule-breaking and aggression  were collected for a sample of adolescents (n = 167, 80 girls; 22.2% Black,  51.5% Caucasian, 18.7% Hispanic) during the summers before and after 9th grade.  Total text frequency, frequency of antisocial texts, and the proportion of the  peer network who exchanged antisocial messages were examined as predictors of  antisocial behavior. The proportion of peers who exchanged antisocial texts  significantly predicted rule-breaking, but not aggression. Study 2 examined the  direction of the relationship documented in Study 1 more thoroughly.  Externalizing behaviors at 9th, 10th, and 11th grade were evaluated as  predictors of the proportion of the peer network that exchanged texts about  antisocial topics (n = 205, 98 girls; 22.4% Black, 53.7% Caucasian, 16.9%  Hispanic). Externalizing behaviors predicted the proportion of adolescents' peer  network that exchanged antisocial texts in each of the subsequent years, but  this proportion of the peer network exchanging antisocial communication did not  predict subsequent externalizing behaviors. The findings suggest that the extent  to which antisocial communication permeates the peer group is a selection  effect.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001020 PMID: 31405396 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Children with prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE) exhibit early self-regulatory  impairments, reflecting a life-course persistent propensity toward behavioral  disinhibition. Previously, we demonstrated the protective role of parental  responsiveness for reducing the risk of exposure-related disruptive behavior in  adolescence. Here, we expanded this line of inquiry, examining whether  responsiveness moderates the relation of PTE to a broader set of behavioral  disinhibition features in early childhood and testing alternative  diathesis-stress versus differential susceptibility explanatory models. PTE was  assessed prospectively using interviews and bioassays in the Midwestern Infant  Development Study (MIDS). Mother-child dyads (N = 276) were re-assessed at  approximately 5 years of age in a preschool follow-up. We quantified maternal  responsiveness and child behavioral disinhibition using a combination of  directly observed activities in the lab and developmentally sensitive  questionnaires. Results supported a diathesis-stress pattern. Children with PTE  and less responsive mothers showed increased disruptive behavior and lower  effortful control compared with children without PTE. In contrast, exposed  children with more responsive mothers had self-regulatory profiles similar to  their non-exposed peers. We did not observe sex differences. Findings provide  greater specification of the protective role of maternal responsiveness for  self-regulation in children with PTE and help clarify mechanisms that may  underscore trajectories of exposure-related behavioral disinhibition.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) may increase the risk of offspring  depression in childhood. Low birth weight is also associated with increased risk  of mental health problems, including depression. This study sought to  investigate (a) whether there is an association between HDP and the risk of  depression in childhood and (b) whether low birth weight mediates this  association. The current study is based on the Avon Longitudinal Study of  Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a prospective, population-based study that has  followed a cohort of offspring since their mothers were pregnant (n = 6,739).  Depression at the age of 7 years was diagnosed using parent reports via the  Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA). Log-binomial regression and  mediation analyses were used. Children exposed to HDP were 2.3 times more likely  to have a depression diagnosis compared with nonexposed children, adjusted Risk  Ratio [RR], 2.31; 95% CI, [1.20, 4.47]. Low birth weight was a weak mediator of  this association. Results were adjusted for confounding variables including  antenatal depression and anxiety during pregnancy.This study suggests that fetal  exposure to maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increased the risk of  childhood depression. The study adds to the evidence suggesting that the uterine  environment is a critical determinant of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric  outcomes.

(4)Department of Psychology, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA.	This study examined the interplay between a polygenic composite and cortisol  activity as moderators of the mediational pathway among family adversity, youth  negative emotional reactivity to family conflict, and their psychological  problems. The longitudinal design contained three annual measurement occasions  with 279 adolescents (Mean age = 13.0 years) and their parents. Latent  difference score analyses indicated that observational ratings of adversity in  interparental and parent-child interactions at Wave 1 predicted increases in a  multimethod, multi-informant assessment of youth negative emotional reactivity  to family conflict from Waves 1 to 2. Changes in youth negative emotional  reactivity, in turn, predicted increases in a multi-informant (i.e., parents,  adolescent, and teacher) assessment of psychological problems from Waves 1 to 3.  Consistent with differential susceptibility theory, the association between  family adversity and negative emotional reactivity was stronger for adolescents  who carried more sensitivity alleles in a polygenic composite consisting of  5-HTTLPR, DRD4 VNTR, and BDNF polymorphisms. Analyses of adolescent cortisol in  the period surrounding a family disagreement task at Wave 1 revealed that  overall cortisol output, rather than cortisol reactivity, served as an  endophenotype of the polygenic composite. Overall cortisol output was  specifically associated with polygenic plasticity and moderated the association  between family adversity and youth negative emotional reactivity in the same for  better or for worse manner as the genetic composite. Finally,  moderator-mediated-moderation analyses indicated that the moderating role of the  polygenic plasticity composite was mediated by the moderating role of adolescent  cortisol output in the association between family adversity and their emotional  reactivity.

The Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) is a widely used measure in developmental  science that assesses adults' current states of mind regarding early  attachment-related experiences with their primary caregivers. The standard  system for coding the AAI recommends classifying individuals categorically as  having an autonomous, dismissing, preoccupied, or unresolved attachment state of  mind. However, previous factor and taxometric analyses suggest that: (a) adults'  attachment states of mind are captured by two weakly correlated factors  reflecting adults' dismissing and preoccupied states of mind and (b) individual  differences on these factors are continuously rather than categorically  distributed. The current study revisited these suggestions about the latent  structure of AAI scales by leveraging individual participant data from 40  studies (N = 3,218), with a particular focus on the controversial observation  from prior factor analytic work that indicators of preoccupied states of mind  and indicators of unresolved states of mind about loss and trauma loaded on a  common factor. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that: (a) a 2-factor model  with weakly correlated dismissing and preoccupied factors and (b) a 3-factor  model that further distinguished unresolved from preoccupied states of mind were  both compatible with the data. The preoccupied and unresolved factors in the  3-factor model were highly correlated. Taxometric analyses suggested that  individual differences in dismissing, preoccupied, and unresolved states of mind  were more consistent with a continuous than a categorical model. The importance  of additional tests of predictive validity of the various models is emphasized.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000978 PMID: 33070805

Frontal EEG asymmetry moderates the associations between negative temperament  and behavioral problems during childhood.	Liu R(1), Calkins SD(2), Bell MA(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA. (2)Department of Human Development and Family Studies, University of North  Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC, USA.	Fearful inhibition and impulsivity-anger significantly predict internalizing and  externalizing problems, respectively. An important moderator that may affect  these associations is frontal EEG asymmetry (FA). We examined how temperament  and FA at 6 years interactively predicted behavioral problems at 9 years. A  community sample of 186 children (93 boys, 93 girls) participated in the study.  Results indicated that the effect of fearful inhibition on parent-reported  internalizing problems increased as children exhibited greater right FA. The  effect of impulsivity-anger on parent-reported externalizing problems increased  as children showed greater left FA. Because FA was allowed to vary rather than  children being dichotomized into membership in left FA and right FA groups, we  observed that children's FA contributed to the resilience process only when FA  reached specific asymmetry levels. These findings highlight the importance of  considering the different functions of FA in combination with specific  dimensions of temperament in predicting children's socioemotional outcomes.  Clinical implications include providing suggestions for intervention services by  demonstrating the role of FA in developing behavioral problems and inspiring  research on whether it is possible to alter EEG activation and thus potentially  improve developmental outcomes.

Animal models of early postnatal mother-infant interactions have highlighted the  importance of tactile contact for biobehavioral outcomes via the modification of  DNA methylation (DNAm). The role of normative variation in contact in early  human development has yet to be explored. In an effort to translate the animal  work on tactile contact to humans, we applied a naturalistic daily diary  strategy to assess the link between maternal contact with infants and epigenetic  signatures in children 4-5 years later, with respect to multiple levels of  child-level factors, including genetic variation and infant distress. We first  investigated DNAm at four candidate genes: the glucocorticoid receptor gene,  nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1 (NR3C1), μ-opioid receptor M1  (OPRM1) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR; related to the neurobiology of social  bonds), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; involved in postnatal  plasticity). Although no candidate gene DNAm sites significantly associated with  early postnatal contact, when we next examined DNAm across the genome,  differentially methylated regions were identified between high and low contact  groups. Using a different application of epigenomic information, we also  quantified epigenetic age, and report that for infants who received low contact  from caregivers, greater infant distress was associated with younger epigenetic  age. These results suggested that early postnatal contact has lasting  associations with child biology.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417001213 PMID: 29162165 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Working memory moderates the association between early institutional care and  separation anxiety symptoms in late childhood and adolescence.	Alba LA(1), Flannery J(2), Shapiro M(3), Tottenham N(4).

Adverse caregiving, for example, previous institutionalization (PI), is often  associated with emotion dysregulation that increases anxiety risk. However, the  concept of developmental multifinality predicts heterogeneity in anxiety  outcomes. Despite this well-known heterogeneity, more work is needed to identify  sources of this heterogeneity and how these sources interact with environmental  risk to influence mental health. Here, working memory (WM) was examined during  late childhood/adolescence as an intra-individual factor to mitigate the risk  for separation anxiety, which is particularly susceptible to caregiving  adversities. A modified "object-in-place" task was administered to 110 youths  (10-17 years old), with or without a history of PI. The PI youths had elevated  separation anxiety scores, which were anticorrelated with morning cortisol  levels, yet there were no group differences in WM. PI youths showed significant  heterogeneity in separation anxiety symptoms and morning cortisol levels, and WM  moderated the link between caregiving and separation anxiety and mediated the  association between separation anxiety and morning cortisol in PI youth.  Findings suggest that (a) institutional care exerts divergent developmental  consequences on separation anxiety versus WM, (b) WM interacts with  adversity-related emotion dysregulation, and (c) WM may be a therapeutic target  for separation anxiety following early caregiving adversity.

Improved characterization of quantitative traits and dimensionally distributed  complex behaviors during toddlerhood may improve early identification of autism  spectrum disorder and related neurodevelopmental disorders. Parents of 205  community-ascertained toddlers (age: mean = 20.2, SD = 2.6 months) completed the  Repetitive Behavior Scales for Early Childhood (RBS-EC) and the Video-Referenced  Rating of Reciprocal Social Behavior (vrRSB), with longitudinal follow-up of  behavioral assessments and/or another round of parent-report questionnaires.  Criterion validity was examined both concurrently and longitudinally using the  Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) as a criterion anchor.  Reciprocal social behavior as measured by the vrRSB was significantly associated  with social competence as measured by the ITSEA, longitudinally and  concurrently. Reciprocal social behavior was not associated with the  externalizing subscale on the ITSEA, providing evidence of discriminant  validity. Higher-order repetitive behaviors (restricted interests; rituals and  routines) as measured by RBS-EC subscales were associated with the dysregulation  and internalizing subscales of the ITSEA, longitudinally and concurrently. All  RBS-EC subscales (excepting repetitive motor) were associated concurrently and  longitudinally with the dysregulation subscale of the ITSEA. We report evidence  of criterion-oriented and discriminant validity for the constructs/domains  captured by the RBS-EC and vrRSB. These instruments may be particularly useful  in characterizing dimensional variability across the typical-to-atypical  continuum.

Social origins of self-regulated attention during infancy and their disruption  in autism spectrum disorder: Implications for early intervention.	Gaffrey MS(1), Markert S(1), Yu C(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. (2)Department of Psychology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.	To understand the complex relationships between autism spectrum disorder (ASD)  and other frequently comorbid conditions, a growing number of studies have  investigated the emergence of ASD during infancy. This research has suggested  that symptoms of ASD and highly related comorbid conditions emerge from complex  interactions between neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities and early environments,  indicating that developing treatments to prevent ASD is highly challenging.  However, it also suggests that attenuating the negative effects of ASD on future  development once identified is possible. The present paper builds on this by  conceptualizing developmental delays in nonsocial skills as the potential  product of altered caregiver-infant interactions following the emergence of ASD  during infancy. And, following emerging findings from caregiver-infant dyadic  head-mounted eye-tracking (D-ET) research, it also suggests that a multiple  pathway model of joint attention can provide mechanistic insights into how ASD  alters the ability of caregiver and infant to create a context for infant  learning. The potential for this view to inform early intervention is further  discussed and illustrated through D-ET data collected prior to and following a  brief, parent-mediated intervention for infant ASD. While promising, further  research informing how a multiple pathway model of joint attention can inform  ASD early intervention is needed.

Children vary in the extent to which they benefit from parenting programs for  conduct problems. How does parental mental health change if children benefit  less or more? We assessed whether changes in conduct problems and maternal  depressive symptoms co-occur following participation in the Incredible Years  parenting program. We integrated individual participant data from 10 randomized  trials (N = 1280; children aged 2-10 years) and distinguished latent classes  based on families' baseline and post-test conduct problems and maternal  depressive symptoms, using repeated measures latent class analysis (RMLCA) and  latent transition analysis (LTA). Classes differed mainly in severity of conduct  problems and depression (RMLCA; 4 classes). Conduct problems reduced in all  classes. Depressive symptoms did not change in most classes, except in a class  of families where conduct problems and depression were particularly severe.  Incredible Years led to a greater likelihood of families with particularly  severe conduct problems and depression moving to a class with mild problems  (LTA; 3 classes). Our findings suggest that for the majority of families,  children's conduct problems reduce, but maternal depressive symptoms do not,  suggesting relative independence, with the exception of families with severe  depression and severe conduct problems where changes for the better do co-occur.

Impairment in reciprocal social behavior (RSB), an essential component of early  social competence, clinically defines autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However,  the behavioral and genetic architecture of RSB in toddlerhood, when ASD first  emerges, has not been fully characterized. We analyzed data from a quantitative  video-referenced rating of RSB (vrRSB) in two toddler samples: a community-based  volunteer research registry (n = 1,563) and an ethnically diverse, longitudinal  twin sample ascertained from two state birth registries (n = 714). Variation in  RSB was continuously distributed, temporally stable, significantly associated  with ASD risk at age 18 months, and only modestly explained by sociodemographic  and medical factors (r2 = 9.4%). Five latent RSB factors were identified and  corresponded to aspects of social communication or restricted repetitive  behaviors, the two core ASD symptom domains. Quantitative genetic analyses  indicated substantial heritability for all factors at age 24 months (h2 ≥ .61).  Genetic influences strongly overlapped across all factors, with a social  motivation factor showing evidence of newly-emerging genetic influences between  the ages of 18 and 24 months. RSB constitutes a heritable, trait-like competency  whose factorial and genetic structure is generalized across diverse populations,  demonstrating its role as an early, enduring dimension of inherited variation in  human social behavior. Substantially overlapping RSB domains, measurable when  core ASD features arise and consolidate, may serve as markers of specific  pathways to autism and anchors to inform determinants of autism's heterogeneity.

Wall Myers TD(1), Salcedo A(2), Frick PJ(3), Ray JV(4), Thornton LC(5),  Steinberg L(6), Cauffman E(7).	Author information: (1)University of Dayton. (2)Baylor College of Medicine. (3)Louisiana State University. (4)University of Texas at San Antonio. (5)Boys Town National Research Hospital. (6)Temple University. (7)University of California,Irvine.	The current study advanced research on the link between community violence  exposure and aggression by comparing the effects of violence exposure on  different functions of aggression and by testing four potential (i.e.,  callous-unemotional traits, consideration of others, impulse control, and  anxiety) mediators of this relationship. Analyses were conducted in an  ethnically/racially diverse sample of 1,216 male first-time juvenile offenders  (M = 15.30 years, SD = 1.29). Our results indicated that violence exposure had  direct effects on both proactive and reactive aggression 18 months later. The  predictive link of violence exposure to proactive aggression was no longer  significant after controlling for proactive aggression at baseline and the  overlap with reactive aggression. In contrast, violence exposure predicted later  reactive aggression even after controlling for baseline reactive aggression and  the overlap with proactive aggression. Mediation analyses of the association  between violence exposure and reactive aggression indicated indirect effects  through all potential mediators, but the strongest indirect effect was through  impulse control. The findings help to advance knowledge on the consequences of  community violence exposure on justice-involved youth.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417001134 PMID: 29692293 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Parental internalizing disorder and the developmental trajectory of infant  self-regulation: The moderating role of positive parental behaviors.	Sun X(1)(2), Seeley JR(3), Allen NB(2).

(2)Department of Psychology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA. (3)Department of Special Education and Clinical Sciences, University of Oregon,  Eugene, OR, USA.	Child self-regulation (SR), a key indicator for later optimal developmental  outcomes, may be compromised in the presence of parental mental disorders,  especially those characterized by affective dysregulation. However, positive  parental behaviors have been shown to buffer against such negative effects,  especially during infancy when SR shows great plasticity to environmental  inputs. The current study investigated the effect of maternal and paternal  lifetime and current internalizing disorders on the developmental trajectory of  infant SR from 3 to 24 months, and the potential moderating role of positive  parental behaviors. A latent growth model revealed that SR increased overall  from 3 to 24 months. Mothers' positive parental behaviors demonstrated  significant moderation effects, such that maternal lifetime internalizing  disorder was associated with higher SR intercept only among those with low  levels of positive parental behavior. Mothers' lifetime internalizing disorder  was also associated with a lower linear slope in SR development with a moderate  effect size. Fathers' current internalizing disorder was significantly  associated with a higher intercept and lower linear slope of the SR trajectory.  The current study expands the infant SR literature by describing its early  developmental trajectory as well as early risk and protective factors within the  parent-infant environment, taking into consideration developmental inputs from  both parents.

Adverse childhood experiences predict autonomic indices of emotion dysregulation  and negative emotional cue-elicited craving among female opioid-treated chronic  pain patients.	Garland EL(1), Reese SE(1), Bedford CE(1), Baker AK(1).	Author information: (1)College of Social Work and Center on Mindfulness and Integrative Health  Intervention Development, University of Utah,Salt Lake City,UT,USA.	Through autonomic and affective mechanisms, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)  may disrupt the capacity to regulate negative emotions, increasing craving and  exacerbating risk for opioid use disorder (OUD) among individuals with chronic  pain who are receiving long-term opioid analgesic pharmacotherapy. This study  examined associations between ACEs, heart rate variability (HRV) during emotion  regulation, and negative emotional cue-elicited craving among a sample of female  opioid-treated chronic pain patients at risk for OUD. A sample of women (N = 36,  mean age = 51.2 ± 9.5) with chronic pain receiving long-term opioid analgesic  pharmacotherapy (mean morphine equivalent daily dose = 87.1 ± 106.9 mg) were  recruited from primary care and pain clinics to complete a randomized task in  which they viewed and reappraised negative affective stimuli while HRV and  craving were assessed. Both ACEs and duration of opioid use significantly  predicted blunted HRV during negative emotion regulation and increased negative  emotional cue-elicited craving. Analysis of study findings from a  multiple-levels-of-analysis approach suggest that exposure to childhood abuse  occasions later emotion dysregulation and appetitive responding toward opioids  in negative affective contexts among adult women with chronic pain, and thus  this vulnerable clinical population should be assessed for OUD risk when  initiating a course of extended, high-dose opioids for pain management.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glucocorticoids influence  neurodevelopment during pregnancy, and there is evidence that BDNF in amniotic  fluid is mainly of fetal origin, while the source of glucocorticoids is  maternal. We tested the hypothesis that maternal early life stress, psychiatric  diagnoses, anxiety, perceived stress, and socioeconomic status influence BDNF  and glucocorticoid concentrations in amniotic fluid in the second trimester. We  studied 79 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis in the early second  trimester and analyzed BDNF, cortisol, and cortisone concentrations in amniotic  fluid. The endocrine data were related to maternal early life adversities  (Childhood Trauma Questionaire), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale),  anxiety, socioeconomic status (family income), and the presence of psychiatric  diseases. We found BDNF in amniotic fluid to be positively related to maternal  early adversity (Childhood Trauma Questionaire). Low family income  (socioeconomic status) was related to high amniotic fluid glucocorticoid  concentrations. Neither glucocorticoid concentrations nor hydroxy steroid  dehydrogenase (HSD2) activity could be related to BDNF concentrations in  amniotic fluid. Early maternal adverse events may be reflected in the fetal BDNF  regulation, and it should be tested whether this relates to differences in  neurodevelopment.

Early childhood social communication deficits in youth at clinical high-risk for  psychosis: Associations with functioning and risk.	Osborne KJ(1), Vargas T(1), Mittal VA(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. (2)Department of Psychiatry, Institute for Policy Research, Department of  Medical Social Sciences, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.	Effective social functioning requires a broad range of social communication  skills that are impaired in psychosis populations. However, little is known  about early childhood (4- to 5-year period) social communication during the  premorbid (pre-illness) stage of psychosis. The present study utilized  retrospective parent reports to examine total early childhood social  communication deficits, as well as deficits in two distinct domains, reciprocal  social interaction (social smiling/eye gaze) and communication (social  chat/gesture), in youth at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis (ages 13-21;  37.2% female). Furthermore, associations between early childhood social  communication and CHR youth's current functioning (social, academic/work),  symptoms (positive/negative), and risk for conversion to psychosis were  examined. Compared to healthy controls, CHR individuals had greater deficits in  total and communication-specific early childhood social communication. Early  childhood total, communication, and reciprocal social interaction deficits were  associated with worse current functioning and greater current negative symptom  severity (amotivation/anhedonia) in CHR youth. Early childhood total and  reciprocal social interaction deficits were also associated with increased risk  for conversion. These findings inform the field's understanding of the etiology  and pathophysiology of psychosis by extending the current developmental  literature on premorbid deficits in psychosis populations to specific domains of  social behavior in a critical developmental period.

One of Tom Dishion's most significant contributions to prevention science was  the development of affordable, ecologically valid interventions, such as the  Family Check-Up, that screen for child and family risk factors broadly, but  concentrate family-specific interventions on those with greatest potential for  population impact. In the spirit of this approach, investigators examined  effects of a brief, universal postnatal home visiting program on child emergency  medical care and billing costs from birth to age 24 months. Family Connects is a  community-wide public health intervention that combines identification and  alignment of community services and resources with brief, postpartum nurse home  visits designed to assess risk, provide supportive guidance, and connect  families with identified risk to community resources. Over 18 months, families  of all 4,777 resident Durham County, North Carolina, births were randomly  assigned based on even or odd birth date to receive a postnatal nurse home  visiting intervention or services as usual (control). Independently, 549 of  these families were randomly selected and participated in an impact evaluation  study. Families, blind to study goals, provided written consent to access  hospital administrative records. Results indicate that children randomly  assigned to Family Connects had significantly less total emergency medical care  (by 37%) through age 24 months, with results observed across almost all  subgroups. Examination of billing records indicate a $3.17 decrease in total  billing costs for each $1 in program costs. Overall, results suggest that  community-wide postpartum support program can significantly reduce population  rates of child emergency medical care through age 24 months while being  cost-beneficial to communities.

The neural correlates of Childhood Trauma Questionnaire scores in adults: A  meta-analysis and review of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.	Heany SJ(1), Groenewold NA(1), Uhlmann A(1), Dalvie S(1), Stein DJ(1), Brooks  SJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Cape Town.	Childhood maltreatment, including abuse and neglect, may have sustained effects  on the integrity and functioning of the brain, alter neurophysiological  responsivity later in life, and predispose individuals toward psychiatric  conditions involving socioaffective disturbances. This meta-analysis aims to  quantify associations between self-reported childhood maltreatment and brain  function in response to socioaffective cues in adults. Seventeen functional  magnetic resonance imaging studies reporting on data from 848 individuals  examined with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire were included in a  meta-analysis of whole-brain findings, or a review of region of interest  findings. The spatial consistency of peak activations associated with  maltreatment exposure was tested using activation likelihood estimation, using a  threshold of p < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons. Adults exposed to  childhood maltreatment showed significantly increased activation in the left  superior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus, and decreased activation  in the left superior parietal lobule and the left hippocampus. Although  hyperresponsivity to socioaffective cues in the amygdala and ventral anterior  cingulate cortex in correlation with maltreatment severity is a replicated  finding in region of interest studies, null results are reported as well. The  findings suggest that childhood maltreatment has sustained effects on brain  function into adulthood, and highlight potential mechanisms for conveying  vulnerability to development of psychopathology.

Coping with stressful life events: Cognitive emotion regulation profiles and  depressive symptoms in adolescents.	van den Heuvel MWH(1), Stikkelbroek YAJ(1), Bodden DHM(1), van Baar AL(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Child and Adolescent Studies, Utrecht University, Post Office  Box 80.140, 3508TCUtrecht, The Netherlands.	Cognitive strategies that adolescents use to cope with negative emotions might  show distinct profiles of cognitive emotion regulation strategies, which could  be differentially associated with depressive symptoms. In total, 411 Dutch  adolescents who had experienced at least one stressful life event that required  some coping strategy participated in this study, including 334 nonclinical and  77 clinically depressed adolescents (12-21 years). A person-centered approach  with Latent Profile Analysis was used to identify underlying profiles of  cognitive emotion regulation based on the adolescents' reports of their use of  cognitive emotion regulation strategies when they were confronted with stressful  life events. Nine different strategies, five adaptive and four maladaptive, were  used as indicators. Four profiles with distinct features were found in the  nonclinical sample, as well as in the combined sample of nonclinical and  clinically depressed adolescents: Low Regulators, High Regulators, Maladaptive  Regulators, and Adaptive Regulators. In both samples, the High Regulators  profile was most commonly used, followed by the Adaptive, Maladaptive, and Low  Regulators profile. Maladaptive Regulators endorsed higher levels of depressive  symptoms relative to Low, High, and Adaptive Regulators. The findings underscore  the utility of using a person-centered approach in order to identify patterns of  cognitive emotion regulation deficits in psychopathology.

Hatoum AS(1), Rhee SH(1), Corley RP(1), Hewitt JK(1), Friedman NP(1).	Author information: (1)University of Colorado Boulder.	This study examined whether executive functions (EFs) might be common features  of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems across development. We  examined relations between three EF latent variables (a common EF factor and  factors specific to updating working memory and shifting sets), constructed from  nine laboratory tasks administered at age 17, to latent growth intercept  (capturing stability) and slope (capturing change) factors of teacher- and  parent-reported internalizing and externalizing behaviors in 885 individual  twins aged 7 to 16 years. We then estimated the proportion of  intercept-intercept and slope-slope correlations predicted by EF as well as the  association between EFs and a common psychopathology factor (P factor) estimated  from all 9 years of internalizing and externalizing measures. Common EF was  negatively associated with the intercepts of teacher-rated internalizing and  externalizing behavior in males, and explained 32% of their covariance; in the P  factor model, common EF was associated with the P factor in males.  Shifting-specific was positively associated with the externalizing slope across  sex. EFs did not explain covariation between parent-rated behaviors. These  results suggest that EFs are associated with stable problem behavior variation,  explain small proportions of covariance, and are a risk factor that that may  depend on gender.

OBJECTIVES: Childhood maltreatment is associated with altered neural reactivity  during autobiographical memory (ABM) recall and a pattern of overgeneral memory  (OGM). Altered ABM and OGM have been linked with psychopathology and poorer  social functioning. The present study investigated the association between  altered ABM and subsequent socio-emotional functioning (measured two years  later) in a sample of adolescents with (N = 20; maltreatment group, MT) and  without (N = 17; non-MT group) documented childhood maltreatment histories. METHOD: At baseline, adolescents (aged 12.6 ± 1.45 years) were administered the  Autobiographical Memory Test to measure OGM. Participants also recalled specific  ABMs in response to emotionally valenced cue words during functional MRI.  Adolescents in both groups underwent assessments measuring depressive symptoms  and prosocial behavior at both timepoints. Regression analyses were carried out  to predict outcome measures at follow-up controlling for baseline levels. RESULTS: In the MT group, greater OGM at baseline significantly predicted  reduced prosocial behavior at follow-up and showed a trend level association  with elevated depressive symptoms. Patterns of altered ABM-related brain  activity did not significantly predict future psycho-social functioning. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings highlight the potential value of OGM as a  cognitive mechanism that could be targeted to reduce risk of depression in  adolescents with prior histories of maltreatment.

Linking emotional reactivity "for better and for worse" to differential  susceptibility to parenting among kindergartners.	Slagt M(1), Dubas JS(1), Ellis BJ(2), van Aken MAG(1), Deković M(1).	Author information: (1)Utrecht University. (2)University of Utah.	This study used a combination of microlevel observation data and longitudinal  questionnaire data to study the relationship between differential reactivity and  differential susceptibility, guided by three questions: (a) Does a subset of  children exist that is both more likely to respond with increasingly negative  emotions to increasingly negative emotions of mothers and with increasingly  positive emotions to increasingly positive emotions of mothers ("emotional  reactivity")? (b) Is emotional reactivity associated with temperament markers  and rearing environment? (c) Are children who show high emotional reactivity  "for better and for worse" also more susceptible to parenting predicting child  behavior across a year? A total of 144 Dutch children (45.3% girls) aged four to  six participated. Latent profile analyses revealed a group of average reactive  children (87%) and a group that was emotionally reactive "for better and for  worse" (13%). Highly reactive children scored higher on surgency and received  lower levels of negative parenting. Finally, associations of negative and  positive parenting with externalizing and prosocial behavior were similar (and  nonsignificant) for highly reactive children and average reactive children. The  findings suggest that children who are emotionally reactive "for better and for  worse" within parent-child interactions are not necessarily more susceptible to  parenting on a developmental time scale.

A randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a peer-based social  mobile game intervention to reduce smoking in youth.	Scholten H(1), Luijten M(1), Granic I(1).	Author information: (1)Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.	Smoking is a major cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality. Almost no  evidence-based intervention programs are available to help youth quit smoking.  We argue that ineffective targeting of peer influence and engagement  difficulties are significant barriers to successful youth smoking cessation. To  address these barriers, we developed the mobile game intervention HitnRun. A  two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT; n = 144) was conducted and young  smokers (Mage = 19.39; SDage = 2.52) were randomly assigned to either play  HitnRun or read a psychoeducational brochure. Prior to, directly following the  intervention period, and after three-month follow-up, weekly smoking behavior,  abstinence rates, intervention dose, and peer- and engagement-related factors  were assessed. Results indicated similar reductions in weekly smoking levels and  similar abstinence rates for both groups. Yet, we found a dose effect with  HitnRun only: The longer participants played HitnRun, the lower their weekly  smoking levels were. In the brochure group, a higher dose was related to higher  weekly smoking levels at all measurement moments. Exploratory analyses showed  the most powerful effects of HitnRun for participants who connected with and  were engaged by the intervention. Future work should build on the promising  potential of HitnRun by increasing personalization efforts and strengthening  peer influence components.

Time-varying associations of racial discrimination and adjustment among  Chinese-heritage adolescents in the United States and Canada.	Juang LP(1), Shen Y(2), Costigan CL(3), Hou Y(4).	Author information: (1)University of Potsdam. (2)Texas State University. (3)University of Victoria. (4)University of Texas at Austin.	The aim of our study was twofold: to examine (a) whether the link between racial  discrimination and adjustment showed age-related changes across early to late  adolescence for Chinese-heritage youth and (b) whether the age-related  associations of the discrimination-adjustment link differed by gender, nativity,  and geographical region. We pooled two independently collected longitudinal data  sets in the United States and Canada (N = 498, ages 12-19 at Wave 1) and used  time-varying effect modeling to show that discrimination is consistently  associated with poorer adjustment across all ages. These associations were  stronger at certain ages, but for males and females, first- and  second-generation adolescents, and US and Canadian adolescents they differed.  There were stronger relations between discrimination and adjustment in early  adolescence for males compared to females, in middle adolescence for  first-generation compared to second-generation adolescents, and in early  adolescence for US adolescents compared to Canadian adolescents. In general,  negative implications for adjustment associated with discrimination diminished  across the span of adolescence for females, second-generation, and US and  Canadian adolescents, but not for males or first-generation adolescents. The  results show that the discrimination-adjustment link must be considered with  regard to age, gender, nativity, and region, and that attention to  discrimination in early adolescence may be especially important.

Child neglect and its relation to emotional and behavioral problems: A  cross-sectional study of primary school-aged children in Tanzania.	Hecker T(1), Boettcher VS(1), Landolt MA(2), Hermenau K(2).	Author information: (1)Bielefeld University. (2)vivo international.	Child maltreatment is known to engender negative emotional and behavioral  consequences. Although neglect is the most frequent form of maltreatment, it has  thus far only received little attention, especially when looking at low-resource  countries. The current study investigated possible associations between neglect  and internalizing and externalizing problems. As neglect and abuse often  co-occur, the latter was controlled for. In total, 409 Tanzanian primary school  students (52% boys, M = 10.5 years, range = 6-15) participated in the  cross-sectional study. Structured clinical interviews were conducted assessing  maltreatment, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. Overall, 31%  (n = 128) of the children reported at least one type of physical neglect and 31%  (n = 127) of emotional neglect. Using structural equation modeling, we found a  significant association between neglect and internalizing (β = 0.59, p &lt; .01)  and externalizing problems (β = 0.35, p &lt; .05). However, these associations  could only be detected in younger children (ages 6-9), whereas in older children  (ages 10-15), mental health problems were significantly related to violence and  abuse. Our findings suggest that the current age may influence the association  between maltreatment type and the development of internalizing and/or  externalizing problems.

Negative affect reactivity to stress and internalizing symptoms over the  transition to college for Latinx adolescents: Buffering role of family support.	Anderson SF(1), Sladek MR(1)(2), Doane LD(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA. (2)Graduate School of Education, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.	Affect reactivity to stress may play a role in the development of internalizing  symptoms during the college transition, a critical developmental juncture for  Latinx adolescents, the largest ethnic minority group on college campuses. This  study examined whether affect reactivity during high school is associated with  internalizing symptoms in college and explored two potential protective factors,  perceived family and peer support. Participants were 209 Latinx adolescents  (Mage = 18.10; 64.4% female) who completed standard surveys and four diary  assessments per day over 7 days (N > 4,500 momentary observations). First, to  measure affect reactivity, we assessed whether perceived stress was associated  with negative affect at the momentary level during high school (senior year).  Second, we tested whether affect reactivity predicted internalizing symptoms  during the first year of college. Third, we tested whether perceived family or  peer support buffered the negative consequences of affect reactivity. Results  indicated statistically significant within- and between-person associations  between stress and negative affect. Moreover, affect reactivity significantly  predicted depressive, but not anxiety, symptoms. Buffering was found for family,  but not peer, support. Findings extend previous research by detecting  associations between momentary affect reactivity and internalizing symptoms  during a sociocultural shift in Latinx adolescents' lives and have implications  for culturally appropriate programs to prevent depressive symptoms.

Early childhood parenting and child impulsivity as precursors to aggression,  substance use, and risky sexual behavior in adolescence and early adulthood.	Hentges RF(1), Shaw DS(1), Wang MT(1).	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh.	The current study utilized a longitudinal design to explore the effect of early  child impulsivity and rejecting parenting on the development of problematic  behaviors in adolescence and early adulthood. Using a low-income sample of 310  mothers and their sons, we examined the direct and interactive effects of child  impulsivity and rejecting parenting at age 2 on aggression and substance use at  ages 12, 15, and 22, as well as risky sexual behavior at ages 15 and 22. Results  revealed that rejecting parenting at age 2 predicted greater aggression at age  12 and risky sexual behavior at ages 15 and 22. Early impulsivity had few direct  effects on later outcomes, with the exception of greater substance use at age  22. Instead, impulsivity emerged as a significant moderator in the link between  rejecting parenting and aggression at all three ages and substance use at age  15. Specifically, early rejecting parenting predicted greater aggression and  substance use only for children high in impulsivity. Findings highlight the  potential for early child and parenting risk factors to have long-term  implications for adjustment, with the combination of high impulsivity and  rejecting parenting being particularly deleterious for problems of aggression  throughout adolescence and into early adulthood.

Opening windows of opportunities: Evidence for interventions to prevent or treat  depression in pregnant women being associated with changes in offspring's  developmental trajectories of psychopathology risk.	Goodman SH(1), Cullum KA(1), Dimidjian S(2), River LM(3), Kim CY(1).	Author information: (1)Emory University. (2)University of Colorado at Boulder. (3)University of Denver.	Although animal models and correlational studies support a model of fetal  programming as a mechanism in the transmission of risk for psychopathology from  parents to children, the experimental studies that are required to empirically  test the model with the human prenatal dyad are scarce. With a systematic review  and meta-analysis of the literature, we critically examined the evidence  regarding the neurobiological and behavioral changes in infants as a function of  randomized clinical trials to prevent or reduce maternal depression during  pregnancy, treating randomized clinical trials as experiments testing the fetal  programming model. Based on 25 articles that met inclusion criteria, we found  support for interventions designed to change maternal prenatal mood being  associated with changes in offspring functioning, but with a very small effect  size. Effect sizes ranged broadly, and were higher for younger children. The  findings enhance understanding of putative mechanisms in the transmission of  risk from women's prenatal depression to infants' vulnerabilities to, and early  signs of, the development of psychopathology. We note limitations of the  literature and suggest solutions to advance understanding of how preventing or  treating depression in pregnant women might disrupt the transmission of risk to  the infants.

Stress sensitization to depression following childhood adversity: Moderation by  HPA axis and serotonergic multilocus profile scores.	Starr LR(1), Stroud CB(2), Shaw ZA(1), Vrshek-Schallhorn S(3).

Childhood adversity appears to sensitize youth to stress, increasing depression  risk following stressful life events occurring throughout the lifespan. Some  evidence suggests hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-related and  serotonergic genetic variation moderates this effect, in a  "gene-by-environment-by-environment" interaction (G × E × E). However, prior  research has tested single genetic variants, limiting power. The current study  uses a multilocus genetic profile score (MGPS) approach to capture polygenic  risk relevant to HPA axis and serotonergic functioning. Adolescents (N = 241,  Mage = 15.90) completed contextual-threat-based interviews assessing childhood  adversity and acute life events, and diagnostic interviews assessing depression.  Established MGPSs indexed genetic variation linked to HPA axis (10 single  nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) and serotonergic (five SNPs) functioning.  Results showed significant MGPS × Childhood Adversity × Recent Life Stress  interactions predicting depression for both HPA axis and serotonergic MGPSs,  with both risk scores predicting stronger Childhood Adversity × Recent Stress  interactions. Serotonergic genetic risk specifically predicted sensitization to  major interpersonal stressors. The serotonergic MGPS G × E × E was re-tested in  an independent replication sample of early adolescent girls, with comparable  results. Findings support the notion that genetic variation linked to these two  neurobiological symptoms alters stress sensitization, and that  gene-by-environment (G × E) interactions may be qualified by environmental  exposures occurring at different points in development.

Longitudinal associations between mother-child conflict and child internalizing  problems in mid-childhood.	Lougheed JP(1)(2), Duncan RJ(2)(3), Keskin G(2), Marceau K(2).

(2)Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Purdue University, West  Lafayette, IN, USA. (3)Department of Public Health, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA.	Several aspects of mother-child relationships are associated with children's  internalizing problems. We examined longitudinal associations between  mother-child conflict and children's internalizing problems in middle childhood.  Specifically, we examined whether conflict and children's internalizing problems  predict each other longitudinally in a sample of children from 3rd through 6th  grade (N = 1,364) and their mothers using a cross-lagged panel model with random  intercepts. In line with expectations, we found stable between-family  differences in both mother-child conflict and children's internalizing problems.  Contrary to expectations, we did not find that mother-child conflict and  children's internalizing problems showed significant cross-lagged associations.  However, mother-child conflict and children's internalizing problems had  correlated errors at each wave, indicating that these two constructs covary with  each other concurrently at multiple times across development, independent of  stable between-family associations (i.e., as one increases, so does the other,  and vice versa). The results of this study point to the importance of using  statistical approaches that can disentangle between-family differences from  within-family processes. In future studies, shorter time scales (e.g., weeks or  months) may better capture dynamic associations between parent-child conflict  and internalizing problems.

Cassidy J(1), Brett BE(1), Gross JT(1), Stern JA(1), Martin DR(1), Mohr JJ(1),  Woodhouse SS(2).	Author information: (1)University of Maryland at College Park. (2)Lehigh University.	Although evidence shows that attachment insecurity and disorganization increase  risk for the development of psychopathology (Fearon, Bakermans-Kranenburg, van  IJzendoorn, Lapsley, & Roisman, 2010; Groh, Roisman, van IJzendoorn,  Bakermans-Kranenburg, & Fearon, 2012), implementation challenges have precluded  dissemination of attachment interventions on the broad scale at which they are  needed. The Circle of Security-Parenting Intervention (COS-P; Cooper, Hoffman, &  Powell, 2009), designed with broad implementation in mind, addresses this gap by  training community service providers to use a manualized, video-based program to  help caregivers provide a secure base and a safe haven for their children. The  present study is a randomized controlled trial of COS-P in a low-income sample  of Head Start enrolled children and their mothers. Mothers (N = 141; 75  intervention, 66 waitlist control) completed a baseline assessment and returned  with their children after the 10-week intervention for the outcome assessment,  which included the Strange Situation. Intent to treat analyses revealed a main  effect for maternal response to child distress, with mothers assigned to COS-P  reporting fewer unsupportive (but not more supportive) responses to distress  than control group mothers, and a main effect for one dimension of child  executive functioning (inhibitory control but not cognitive flexibility when  maternal age and marital status were controlled), with intervention group  children showing greater control. There were, however, no main effects of  intervention for child attachment or behavior problems. Exploratory follow-up  analyses suggested intervention effects were moderated by maternal attachment  style or depressive symptoms, with moderated intervention effects emerging for  child attachment security and disorganization, but not avoidance; for inhibitory  control but not cognitive flexibility; and for child internalizing but not  externalizing behavior problems. This initial randomized controlled trial of the  efficacy of COS-P sets the stage for further exploration of "what works for  whom" in attachment intervention.

Following recent advances in behavioral and psychiatric epigenetics, researchers  are increasingly using epigenetic methods to study prenatal exposure to maternal  mood disorder and its effects on fetal and newborn neurobehavior. Despite  notable progress, various methodological limitations continue to obscure our  understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underpinning prenatal exposure to  maternal mood disorder on newborn neurobehavioral development. Here we detail  this problem, discussing limitations of the currently dominant analytical  approaches (i.e., candidate epigenetic and epigenome-wide association studies),  then present a solution that retains many benefits of existing methods while  minimizing their shortcomings: epigenetic pathway analysis. We argue that the  application of pathway-based epigenetic approaches that target DNA methylation  at transcription factor binding sites could substantially deepen our mechanistic  understanding of how prenatal exposures influence newborn neurobehavior.

During South Africa's first two decades as a democracy, the Western Cape  Province has undergone radical changes to its healthcare system in an effort to  address the extensive socioeconomic inequities that remain in the aftermath of  the apartheid era. Although progress has been made, there is a clear need for  interventions that support parents and children receiving health services in the  public sector who are vulnerable to multiple psychosocial risks associated with  extreme poverty. In this mixed-method study, we examined the feasibility and  acceptability of adapting an evidence-based parenting intervention called  Mothering from the Inside Out that was developed for mothers who are vulnerable  to similar risks in the United States. Using qualitative methods, we documented  the collaborative process that was guided by principles of community-based  participatory research and examined themes in the Western Cape collaborators'  perspectives about the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Using  quantitative methods, we tested the preliminary efficacy of the adapted version  of Mothering from the Inside Out for improving maternal reflective functioning  and mother-child interactions. Although findings from both study components  indicated preliminary promise, a number of obstacles and challenges at multiple  levels underscore the need for (a) flexibility and contextual support for  intervention research conducted in under-resourced communities, (b) clinical  sensitivity to the unique experiences of parents rearing children in highly  stressful, under-resourced environments, and (c) equal partnerships that allow  the expertise of local providers to inform the design proposals of consulting  investigators.

(2)Department of Psychology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado,  USA.	There is a need to understand how the joint development of externalizing and  internalizing behaviors is related to substance use, particularly among  historically understudied and often disadvantaged populations. Latent class  models were used to estimate patterns of externalizing behaviors and  internalizing behaviors in the form of depressive and anxious symptoms from age  6 to 14 among 390 Black and Hispanic youth. Then, growth curve models of  substance use between the ages of 15 and 19 were estimated as a function of  joint latent class membership. Only elevated levels of externalizing behaviors  were associated with higher levels of substance use through age 18.  Internalizing behaviors appeared to serve as a protective factor among those  with moderate displays of externalizing behavior only. Additionally, growth in  substance use from ages 15 to 19 was slower among those who displayed the  highest level of externalizing behaviors, and internalizing behaviors appeared  to moderate growth (and serve as protective factor) among those who displayed  moderate levels of externalizing behaviors. The findings underscore the  importance of pattern profiles based on observations of the joint development of  problem behaviors to assess risk for substance use, particularly in understudied  populations where risk/protective factors may operate in a unique manner.

An examination of father vulnerability and coercive family process after the  birth of a sibling: A spillover cascade model.	Stevenson MM(1), Volling BL(1), Gonzalez R(1).	Author information: (1)University of Michigan.	Fathers are a crucial source of support for children following the birth of an  infant sibling. This study examined whether fathers were more vulnerable to the  effects of interparental conflict than mothers, and whether there was a  subsequent spillover cascade from interparental conflict to children's  externalizing behavior problems. We followed 241 families after the birth of a  second child. Mothers and fathers reported on interparental conflict and  parental efficacy at 1 and 4 months postpartum and punitive discipline and  firstborn children's externalizing behavior problems across a longitudinal  investigation (prenatal and 4, 8, and 12 months postpartum). For both mothers  and fathers, interparental conflict prenatally predicted decreased parental  efficacy following the birth. Fathers' lower parental efficacy was significantly  associated with increased punitive discipline toward the older sibling at 4  months, whereas mothers' lower parental efficacy was not. Coercive family  processes were present between mothers' and fathers' punitive discipline and  older siblings' externalizing behavior problems. Results were inconsistent with  the father vulnerability hypothesis in that both mothers and fathers were  vulnerable to interparental conflict, which in turn spilled over to create  coercive family processes that exacerbated children's externalizing behavior  problems in the year following the birth of a second child.

Despite evidence of some intergenerational continuity of maltreatment, a notable  proportion of parents maltreated in childhood do not perpetuate the cycle of  maltreatment. The aim of this study was to identify factors that would  distinguish mother-child dyads where intergenerational continuity was present  from dyads characterized by intergenerational discontinuity. The sample included  193 children and their mothers, drawn from two populations: 74 maltreated  children recruited through Child Protection Services and 119 nonmaltreated  children recruited among low-income families. Factors investigated included  maternal childhood maltreatment, psychological functioning, and family ecology.  Compared to maltreated mothers who broke the cycle of maltreatment, those who  perpetuated the cycle were more likely to have experienced childhood physical  neglect and multitype maltreatment, and to experience sociodemographic risk,  intimate partner violence, and lack of family support. Compared to nonmaltreated  mothers who maintained a nonmaltreating child-rearing environment: (a)  maltreated mothers who broke the cycle were more likely to experience  residential instability and lack of family support, and (b) nonmaltreated  mothers whose child was maltreated were more likely to experience  sociodemographic risk and lack of family support. Maternal psychological  functioning did not discriminate maltreatment groups. Lending empirical support  to a diathesis-stress model of poor parenting, these findings suggest that  family-ecology related stress, but not maternal psychological difficulties, may  create additional burden that will precipitate the risk of maltreatment  intergenerational continuity.

Author information: (1)Williams College. (2)Georgia State University. (3)Arizona State University. (4)University of California at Irvine.	Research suggests that early adversity places individuals at risk for  psychopathology across the life span. Guided by concepts of allostasis and  allostatic load, the present study examined whether early adversity contributes  to the development of subsequent internalizing symptoms through its association  with traitlike individual differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis  regulation. Early adolescent girls (n = 113; M age = 12.30 years) provided  saliva samples at waking, 30 min postwaking, and bedtime over 3 days (later  assayed for cortisol). Objective contextual stress interviews with adolescents  and their mothers were used to assess the accumulation of nine types of early  adversity within the family environment. Greater early adversity predicted  subsequent increases in internalizing symptoms through lower levels of latent  trait cortisol. Traitlike individual differences in  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity may be among the mechanisms through  which early adversity confers risk for the development of psychopathology.

Author information: (1)Université du Québec à Montréal. (2)Université de Montréal. (3)Concordia University. (4)Université Paris 8.	According to the developmental psychopathology framework, adverse childhood  experiences, including child sexual abuse (CSA), may alter the course of normal  development in children. Attachment security has been identified as a protective  factor against psychopathology and may thus play a critical role in predicting  victims' adaptation. The main objective of the present study was to investigate  the mediating effect of attachment representations in the relation between CSA  and behavior problems over a 1-year period. The sample consisted of 391 children  (251 sexually abused) aged 3.5 to 6 years. The Attachment Story Completion Task  and the Child Behavior Checklist were used. Disorganized attachment partially  mediated the relation between CSA and children's internalizing and externalizing  behavior problems 1 year following the initial assessment. This mediation effect  was not found for ambivalent nor secure attachment dimensions. Child gender was  found to moderate the association between CSA and disorganization, with larger  effects of CSA among boys. These findings underscore the importance of  considering attachment representations in treatment programs for preschool  victims. Evidence-based practice focusing on trauma could be combined with an  attachment-based intervention targeting the parent-child relationship. Moreover,  interventions should be gender sensitive, as CSA appears to affect boys and  girls differently.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418000226 PMID: 29681251 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Children of adolescent mothers are a high-risk group for negative child  development. Previous findings suggest that early interventions may enhance  child development by improving mother-child interaction. The purpose of the  current study was to evaluate a mother-child intervention (STEEP-b) program in  high-risk adolescent mother-infant dyads (N = 56) within a randomized controlled  trial (RCT). Mother-child interaction was assessed at baseline (T1),  postintervention (T2), and follow-up (T3). The primary outcome was the change in  maternal sensitivity and child responsiveness from T1 to T2 that was measured by  blinded ratings of videotaped mother-child-interaction with the Emotional  Availability Scales. A modified intention-to-treat analysis was performed to  examine the data. No intervention effect was found for maternal sensitivity, 95%  CI [-0.59-0.60], p = .99, and child responsiveness, 95% CI [-0.51-0.62], p =  .84. Maternal sensitivity and child responsiveness did not change over time in  both groups (all ps > .05). A statistically nonsignificant, but potentially  clinically meaningful difference emerged between rates of serious adverse  events, SC: 4 (14.8%), STEEP-b: 1 (3.4%), possibly driven by different intensity  of surveillance of dyads in the treatment groups. The current findings question  the effectiveness of STEEP-b for high-risk adolescent mothers and do not justify  the broad implementation of this approach.

We investigated whether neurobehavioral markers of risk for emotion  dysregulation were evident among newborns, as well as whether the identified  markers were associated with prenatal exposure to maternal emotion  dysregulation. Pregnant women (N = 162) reported on their emotion dysregulation  prior to a laboratory assessment. The women were then invited to the laboratory  to assess baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and RSA in response to an  infant cry. Newborns were assessed after birth via the NICU Network  Neurobehavioral Scale. We identified two newborn neurobehavioral factors-arousal  and attention-via exploratory factor analysis. Low arousal was characterized by  less irritability, excitability, and motor agitation, while low attention was  related to a lower threshold for auditory and visual stimulation, less sustained  attention, and poorer visual tracking abilities. Pregnant women who reported  higher levels of emotion dysregulation had newborns with low arousal levels and  less attention. Larger decreases in maternal RSA in response to cry were also  related to lower newborn arousal. We provide the first evidence that a woman's  emotion dysregulation while pregnant is associated with risks for dysregulation  in her newborn. Implications for intergenerational transmission of emotion  dysregulation are discussed.

We examined the prospective associations of objective and subjective measures of  stress during pregnancy with infant stress reactivity and regulation, an  early-life predictor of psychopathology. In a racially and ethnically diverse  low-income sample of 151 mother-infant dyads, maternal reports of stressful life  events (SLE) and perceived stress (PS) were collected serially over gestation  and the early postpartum period. Infant reactivity and regulation at 6 months of  age was assessed via maternal report of temperament (negativity, surgency, and  regulation) and infant parasympathetic nervous system physiology (respiratory  sinus arrhythmia [RSA]) during the Still Face Paradigm. Regression models  predicting infant temperament showed higher maternal prenatal PS predicted lower  surgency and self-regulation but not negativity. Regression models predicting  infant physiology showed higher numbers of SLE during gestation predicted  greater RSA reactivity and weaker recovery. Tests of interactions revealed SLE  predicted RSA reactivity only at moderate to high levels of PS. Thus, findings  suggest objective and subjective measures of maternal prenatal stress uniquely  predict infant behavior and physiology, adjusting for key pre- and postnatal  covariates, and advance the limited evidence for such prenatal programming  within high-risk populations. Assessing multiple levels of maternal stress and  offspring stress reactivity and regulation provides a richer picture of  intergenerational transmission of adversity.

Doane LD(1), Sladek MR(1), Breitenstein RS(1), Park H(1), Castro SA(1), Kennedy  JL(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University.	Culturally linked family influences during adolescence are important predictors  of health and well-being for Latino youth, yet few studies have examined whether  these familial influences are associated with indicators of typical  physiological stress processes. Following a cultural neurobiology framework, we  examined the role of family in the everyday lives of Latino adolescents (N =  209; Mage = 18.10; 85.1% Mexican descent; 64.4% female) by investigating  familism values and perceptions of parent support as well as daily family  assistance behaviors in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis diurnal  patterns, indexed by salivary cortisol five times a day for 3 weekdays.  Three-level growth curve analyses revealed that perceptions of parental support  were associated with greater cortisol awakening responses, whereas familism  values were not associated with diurnal cortisol patterns. In day-to-day  analyses, assisting family during the day (compared to not assisting family) was  associated with lower waking cortisol levels and flatter diurnal slopes the next  day. Our findings highlight the dynamic associations and multiple time courses  between cultural values and behaviors, daily experiences, and physiological  stress processes for Latino adolescents. Further, we identified important  cultural risk and promotive factors associated with physiological regulation in  daily life and potential pathways toward health outcomes in adulthood.

The influence of early familial adversity on adolescent risk behaviors and  mental health: Stability and transition in family adversity profiles in a cohort  sample.	Wadman R(1), Hiller RM(2), St Clair MC(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, UK. (2)Department of Psychology, University of Bath, Bath, UK.	Although familial adversity is associated with poorer outcomes in childhood and  adulthood, little research has looked at the influence of stability or  transition between distinct familial adversity subgroups or the impact in  adolescence. Using data from the 9-month, 3-, 5-, and 14-year time waves of the  Millennium Cohort Study (n > 18,000), we used latent class analysis to identify  distinct classes of early familial adversity (marital instability/conflict,  "suboptimal" parenting, economic disadvantage, and parental mental health  problems) and the impact of these adversity classes on adolescent (a) mental  health (including self-harm), (b) risk taking, (c) criminality, and (d)  victimization. Four profiles were identified largely differing on economic  hardship, family composition, and parental conflict. Across the first three time  points, 72% of the sample remained stable, with the remainder transitioning  between classes. Adolescents in the higher risk groups (particularly categorized  by economic hardship or high parental conflict) had poorer outcomes in  adolescence. Transitioning to a higher adversity group at any time in the first  5 years was associated with poorer outcomes but was particularly pronounced when  the transition occurred when the child was under 3 years. These findings  demonstrate the broad consequences of early familial adversity and the need for  targeted early support for at-risk families.

Vaillancourt T(1), Haltigan JD(1).	Author information: (1)University of Ottawa.	The codevelopment of symptoms of depression and socially prescribed  perfectionism across adolescence (age 12-17) and non-age-overlapping childhood  predictors (age 10-11) of joint trajectory group membership were examined in a  sample of 700 Canadian youth. Results indicated that most adolescents (75.8%)  followed a trajectory of low depression symptoms (low stable), whereas 15.7%  followed an increasing trajectory (increasing), and 8.5% followed a trajectory  that began high and decreased over time (high decreasing). More girls than boys  were found in the increasing and high decreasing depression trajectories.  Adolescents followed three distinct trajectories of socially prescribed  perfectionism: 41.6% were in a low stable group, 40.5% in a moderate increasing  group, and 17.9% in a high increasing group. Eight percent followed a high-risk  dual trajectory of increasing depression and high increasing socially prescribed  perfectionism. This joint trajectory was predicted by being bullied, anxious,  and relationally aggressive (compared to the low-risk trajectory of low stable  depression and perfectionism) at ages 10 and 11. These same predictors, along  with poorer family functioning and lower family income, differentiated the joint  high decreasing depression/high increasing perfectionism group from the low/low  joint group, which comprised of 3.8% of the sample. The developmental  progression was best characterized as depression leading to socially prescribed  perfectionism. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.

Current adolescent substance use risk models have inadequately predicted use for  African Americans, offering limited knowledge about differential predictability  as a function of developmental period. Among a sample of 500 African American  youth (ages 11-21), four risk indices (i.e., social risk, attitudinal risk,  intrapersonal risk, and racial discrimination risk) were examined in the  prediction of alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette initiation during early (ages  11-13), mid (ages 16-18), and late (ages 19-21) adolescence. Results showed that  when developmental periods were combined, racial discrimination was the only  index that predicted initiation for all three substances. However, when risk  models were stratified based on developmental period, variation was found within  and across substance types. Results highlight the importance of racial  discrimination in understanding substance use initiation among African American  youth and the need for tailored interventions based on developmental stage.

Personality, romantic relationships, and alcohol use disorder symptoms in  adolescence and young adulthood: An evaluation of personality × social context  interplay.

(2)Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. (3)Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.	Prior research has shown that person-level characteristics (e.g., temperament,  personality) correlate and interact with social-contextual factors (e.g.,  parent-child relationship quality, antisocial peer affiliation) to predict  adolescent substance use, but less research has examined similar processes for  adult substance use problems. We addressed this gap by testing for personality ×  romantic partner context interplay in relation to symptoms of alcohol use  disorder (AUD) at ages 24 and 29. Participants were twins in the longitudinal  Minnesota Twin Family Study (N = 2,769; 52% female). Results support the  corresponsive principle of personality in that we found that key personality  traits in late adolescence (low constraint, negative emotionality) predicted  subsequent "selection" into key social contexts in early adulthood (poorer  quality romantic relationships and greater romantic partner alcohol use), which  subsequently reinforced those traits and associated outcomes (including  correlated AUD symptoms) through late young adulthood. There were few meaningful  gender differences in these associations. There was also no support for the  personality × romantic partner context interaction as a significant predictor of  AUD symptoms at ages 24 or 29. Taken together with prior studies, these results  suggest that such interactions may be less relevant to the development of young  adult AUD compared to adolescent substance use problems.

(2)University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health. (3)Iowa State University.	Scarce research has examined stress responsivity among Latino youths, and no  studies have focused on the role of acculturation in shaping cortisol stress  response in this population. This study assessed Mexican American adolescents'  Mexican and Anglo cultural orientations and examined prospective associations  between their patterns of bicultural orientation and  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal cortisol reactivity to an adapted Trier Social  Stress Test. The sample included 264 youths from a longitudinal birth cohort  study who completed the Trier Social Stress Test and provided saliva samples at  age 14. The youths completed assessments of cultural orientation at age 12, and  family conflict and familism at age 14. Analyses testing the interactive effects  of Anglo and Mexican orientation showed significant associations with cortisol  responsivity, including the reactivity slope, peak levels, and recovery, but  these associations were not mediated by family conflict nor familism values.  Findings revealed that bicultural youth (high on both Anglo and Mexican  orientations) showed an expected pattern of high cortisol responsivity, which  may be adaptive in the context of a strong acute stressor, whereas individuals  endorsing only high levels of Anglo orientation had a blunted cortisol response.  Findings are discussed in relation to research on biculturalism and the  trade-offs and potential recalibration of a contextually responsive  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis for acculturating adolescents.

Deployment to war is associated with disruptions to emotion regulation and  parenting. Using data from a randomized controlled trial, we examined whether  fathers with poorer emotion regulation would differentially benefit from the  After Deployment, Adaptive Parenting Tools program, a 14-session group-based  parenting intervention. Prior analyses of the intervention demonstrated benefits  to observed couple parenting and children's adjustment, but not to fathers'  observed parenting. In this study we examined whether intervention effects on  fathers' observed distress avoidance were moderated by baseline emotion  regulation, and whether reduced distress avoidance was associated with improved  observed parenting and reduced children's internalizing symptoms. A subset of  the full randomized controlled trial sample (181 families with a father who had  returned from deployment to war in Iraq or Afghanistan, a nondeployed mother,  and a target child aged 4-13) completed measures at baseline, 12-months, and  24-months postbaseline. Results indicated that fathers high in baseline emotion  regulation difficulties assigned to the intervention group showed reductions in  observed distress avoidance at 12 months compared to controls, which were  subsequently associated with improvements in observed parenting practices and  reductions in children's internalizing symptoms at 24 months. The results  suggest a role for personalizing parenting programs for fathers high in emotion  dysregulation.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001238 PMID: 31718738 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Reexamining the restraint pathway as a conditional process among adolescent  girls: When does dieting link body dissatisfaction to bulimia?	Morrissey RA(1), Gondoli DM(1), Corning AF(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA.	The mediational sequence from body dissatisfaction through dieting to  bulimia-often referred to as the "restraint pathway"-has been validated in  numerous samples of adolescent girls, but the prevalence rate of bulimic  pathology pales in comparison to rates of body dissatisfaction and dieting in  this risk group. This discrepancy indicates that the restraint pathway may only  apply to adolescent girls possessing certain characteristics or experiencing  certain circumstances. Accordingly, the current study examined the moderating  roles of thin-ideal internalization, interoceptive deficits, and age by using  self-report data from a community sample of 353 middle school (n = 115), high  school (n = 112), and college girls (n = 126). We found that (a)  body-dissatisfied girls who reported high, versus low, thin-ideal  internalization engaged in greater dietary restraint; (b) only dieters who  reported high interoceptive deficits and were of college age expressed bulimic  symptoms; and (c) the mediating effect pertained only to college girls with high  interoceptive deficits, but was strongest for those who reported high, versus  low, thin-ideal internalization. These results suggest that the restraint  pathway's precision may be fine-tuned through greater sensitivity to  potentiating factors and developmental context. Theoretical, empirical, and  practical implications are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001287 PMID: 31658908 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Homotypic and heterotypic continuity of internalizing and externalizing symptoms  from ages 3 to 12: The moderating role of diurnal cortisol.	Frost A(1), Kessel E(1), Black S(2), Goldstein B(1), Bernard K(1), Klein DN(1).	Author information: (1)Stony Brook University. (2)The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.	Psychological symptoms that arise in early childhood can follow a multitude of  patterns into adolescence, including homotypic continuity (i.e., similar  symptoms over time) and heterotypic continuity (i.e., a shift in symptoms over  time). However, we know very little about the factors that distinguish homotypic  vs. heterotypic continuity of early internalizing and externalizing symptoms  over development. In a separate line of research, diurnal cortisol has been  shown to predict later internalizing and externalizing problems. In the current  study, we tested whether diurnal cortisol patterns moderated the course of  internalizing and externalizing symptoms from preschool to early adolescence.  554 children (54% male) and parents participated in a longitudinal study.  Parents reported on their children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms at  ages 3 and 12, and children collected diurnal saliva samples at age 9. Results  showed that a steeper cortisol decline at age 9 combined with high internalizing  or externalizing problems at age 3 predicted higher internalizing problems at  age 12. A more blunted cortisol decline combined with early internalizing or  externalizing problems predicted higher externalizing problems in early  adolescence. These results illustrate the moderating role of stress system  functioning in homotypic and heterotypic patterns of psychopathology from  preschool to early adolescence.

Behavioral Inhibition (BI) is a temperament type that predicts social withdrawal  in childhood and anxiety disorders later in life. However, not all BI children  develop anxiety. Attention bias (AB) may enhance the vulnerability for anxiety  in BI children, and interfere with their development of effective emotion  regulation. In order to fully probe attention patterns, we used traditional  measures of reaction time (RT), stationary eye-tracking, and recently emerging  mobile eye-tracking measures of attention in a sample of 5- to 7-year-olds  characterized as BI (N = 23) or non-BI (N = 58) using parent reports. There were  no BI-related differences in RT or stationary eye-tracking indices of AB in a  dot-probe task. However, findings in a subsample from whom eye-tracking data  were collected during a live social interaction indicated that BI children (N =  12) directed fewer gaze shifts to the stranger than non-BI children (N = 25).  Moreover, the frequency of gazes toward the stranger was positively associated  with stationary AB only in BI, but not in non-BI, children. Hence, BI was  characterized by a consistent pattern of attention across stationary and  ambulatory measures. We demonstrate the utility of mobile eye-tracking as an  effective tool to extend the assessment of attention and regulation to social  interactive contexts.

Child maltreatment has been associated with various cumulative risk factors.  However, little is known about the extent to which genetic and environmental  factors contribute to individual differences between parents in perpetrating  child maltreatment. To estimate the relative contribution of genetic and  environmental factors to perpetrating maltreatment we used a parent-based  extended family design. Child-reported perpetrated maltreatment was available  for 556 parents (283 women) from 63 families. To explore reporter effects (i.e.,  child perspective on maltreatment), child reports were compared to  multi-informant reports. Based on polygenic model analyses, most of the variance  related to the perpetration of physical abuse and emotional neglect was  explained by common environmental factors (physical abuse: c2 = 59%, SE = 12%, p  = .006; emotional neglect: c2 = 47%, SE = 8%, p &lt; .001) whereas genetic  factors did not significantly contribute to the model. For perpetrated emotional  abuse, in contrast, genetic factors did significantly contribute to perpetrated  emotional abuse (h2 = 33%, SE = 8%, p &lt; .001), whereas common environment  factors did not. Multi-informant reports led to similar estimates of genetic and  common environmental effects on all measures except for emotional abuse, where a  multi-informant approach yielded higher estimates of the common environmental  effects. Overall, estimates of unique environment, including measurement error,  were lower using multi-informant reports. In conclusion, our findings suggest  that genetic pathways play a significant role in perpetrating emotional abuse,  while physical abuse and emotional neglect are transmitted primarily through  common environmental factors. These findings imply that interventions may need  to target different mechanisms dependings on maltreatment type.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418001608 PMID: 30757990 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

(3)Montefiore Medical Center.	This paper reports on a randomized control trial involving children less than 3  years old and their mothers who were regarded at risk of maltreating their  children by referral agencies. Mothers' risk status derived from a heavy trauma  burden (average exposure over the first 18 years of their lives to 10 possible  adverse childhood experiences [ACEs] was &gt;5), mental health challenges  (15%-28% had experienced a prior psychiatric hospitalization), and prior removal  of a child to foster care (20%). Mothers were randomly assigned to either a  widely used parenting class known as Systematic Training for Effective Parenting  (STEP) or the Group Attachment-Based Intervention (GABI), a multifamily 26-week  treatment. The resulting mother-child pairs available for consideration in this  baseline versus end-of-treatment report were 35 families in the STEP arm and 43  families in the GABI arm. The focus of this paper is the outcome measure of  observed parent-child relationship assessed with the Coding of Interactive  Behavior (Feldman, 1998) collected at baseline and end of treatment. In  comparison to STEP, results indicated that GABI was linked to significant  improvements in maternal supportive presence and dyadic reciprocity, and  significant declines in maternal hostility and dyadic constriction (proxies for  risk of child maltreatment). These medium-to large-sized effects remained  significant even after controlling for mothers' prior ACEs in analysis of  covariance procedures. In addition, two small interaction effects of ACEs by  treatment type were found, underlining the need for, and value of, treatments  that are sensitive to parents' traumatic histories.

Growing evidence suggests that emotion socialization may be disrupted by  maternal depression. However, little is known about emotion-related parenting by  mothers with bipolar disorder or whether affective modeling in early childhood  is linked to young adults' recollections of emotion socialization practices. The  current study investigates emotion socialization by mothers with histories of  major depression, bipolar disorder, or no mood disorder. Affective modeling was  coded from parent-child interactions in early childhood and maternal responses  to negative emotions were recollected by young adult offspring (n = 131, 59.5%  female, M age = 22.16, SD = 2.58). Multilevel models revealed that maternal  bipolar disorder was associated with more neglecting, punishing, and magnifying  responses to children's emotions, whereas maternal major depression was  associated with more magnifying responses; links between maternal diagnosis and  magnifying responses were robust to covariates. Young adult recollections of  maternal responses to emotion were predicted by affective modeling in early  childhood, providing preliminary validity evidence for the Emotions as a Child  Scale. Findings provide novel evidence that major depression and bipolar  disorder are associated with altered emotion socialization and that maternal  affective modeling in early childhood prospectively predicts young adults'  recollections of emotion socialization in families with and without mood  disorder.

This article extends the research focusing on the early origins of  psychopathology into the prenatal period, by exploring the association between  maternal prenatal depression and offspring (fetal and infant) neurobehavior. The  sample is recruited from a rural population in South India where women in the  third trimester of pregnancy were assessed for depression and the heart rate  responses of their fetuses to extrinsically applied vibroacoustic stimuli were  studied. At 2 months postbirth, infant temperament and cortisol responsivity to  immunization were assessed. The association between maternal prenatal depression  and fetal responsivity to vibroacoustic stimulation, and infant responsivity to  immunization, was U shaped with higher levels of responsivity noted in the  offspring of mothers with very high and very low depression scores, and lower  levels noted in the offspring of mothers with moderate depression scores.  Maternal prenatal depression was not associated with infant temperament. The  findings highlight the importance of environmental influences in the  developmental origins of neurobehavior, suggesting that such differences, not  evident at baseline, may emerge upon exposure to stressors. The study also  emphasizes the need for further investigation in low- and middle-income contexts  by providing preliminary evidence of the differing patterns of association  observed between high- and low-income populations.

Previous research suggests that the experience of abuse and neglect in childhood  has negative implications for physical health in adulthood. Using data from the  Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation (N = 115), the present  research examined the predictive significance of childhood physical abuse,  sexual abuse, and physical/cognitive neglect for multilevel assessments of  physical health at midlife (age 37-39 years), including biomarkers of  cardiometabolic risk, self-reports of quality of health, and a number of health  problems. Analyses revealed that childhood physical/cognitive neglect, but not  physical or sexual abuse, predicted all three health outcomes in middle  adulthood, even when controlling for demographic risk factors and adult health  maintenance behaviors.

We examined maternal depression and maternal sensitivity as mediators of the  association between maternal childhood adversity and her child's temperament in  239 mother-child dyads from a longitudinal, birth cohort study. We used an  integrated measure of maternal childhood adversity that included the Childhood  Trauma Questionnaire and the Parental Bonding Index. Maternal depression was  assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at 6 months postpartum.  Maternal sensitivity was assessed with the Ainsworth maternal sensitivity scales  at 6 months. A measure of "negative emotionality/behavioral dysregulation" was  derived from the Early Childhood Behaviour Questionnaire administered at 36  months. Bootstrapping-based mediation analyses revealed that maternal depression  mediated the effect of maternal childhood adversity on offspring negative  emotionality/behavioral dysregulation (95% confidence interval [0.026, 0.144]).  We also found a serial, indirect effect of maternal childhood adversity on child  negative emotionality/behavioral mediated first by maternal depression and then  by maternal sensitivity (95% confidence interval [0.031, 0.156]). Results  suggest the intergenerational transmission of the effects of maternal childhood  adversity to the offspring occurs through a two-step, serial pathway, involving  maternal depression and maternal sensitivity.

For African American emerging adult men, developmental challenges are evident in  their escalating substance abuse and depressive symptoms; this is particularly  true for men from low-resource communities. The present study tests a  developmental model linking childhood adversity and contemporaneous contextual  stressors to increases in emerging adults' substance use and depressive  symptoms, indirectly, via increases in defensive/hostile relational schemas and  social developmental risk factors (e.g., risky peers and romantic partners, lack  of involvement in school or work). We also advance exploratory hypotheses  regarding DNA methylation in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) as a moderator of  the effects of stress on relational schemas. Hypotheses were tested with three  waves of data from 505 rural African American men aged 19-25 years. Adverse  childhood experiences predicted exposure to emerging adult contextual stressors.  Contextual stressors forecast increases in defensive/hostile relational schemas,  which increased social developmental risk factors. Social developmental risk  factors proximally predicted increases in substance abuse and depressive  symptoms. OXTR DNA methylation moderated the effects of contextual stressors on  defensive/hostile relational schemas. Findings suggest that early exposures to  stress carry forward to affect the development of social developmental risk  factors in emerging adulthood, which place rural African American men at risk  for increased substance abuse and depressive symptoms during the emerging adult  years.

(2)Yale University School of Nursing, New Haven, CT, USA. (3)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN,  USA.	In this article, we describe the results of the second phase of a randomized  controlled trial of Minding the Baby (MTB), an interdisciplinary reflective  parenting intervention for infants and their families. Young first-time mothers  living in underserved, poor, urban communities received intensive home visiting  services from a nurse and social worker team for 27 months, from pregnancy to  the child's second birthday. Results indicate that MTB mothers' levels of  reflective functioning was more likely to increase over the course of the  intervention than were those of control group mothers. Likewise, infants in the  MTB group were significantly more likely to be securely attached, and  significantly less likely to be disorganized, than infants in the control group.  We discuss our findings in terms of their contribution to understanding the  impacts and import of intensive intervention with vulnerable families during the  earliest stages of parenthood in preventing the intergenerational transmission  of disrupted relationships and insecure attachment.

Research suggests an increased prevalence of callous-unemotional (CU) traits in  children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and a similar impairment in fear  recognition to that reported in non-ASD populations. However, past work has used  measures not specifically designed to measure CU traits and has not examined  whether decreased attention to the eyes reported in non-ASD populations is also  present in individuals with ASD. The current paper uses a measure specifically  designed to measure CU traits to estimate prevalence in a large community-based  ASD sample. Parents of 189 adolescents with ASD completed questionnaires  assessing CU traits, and emotional and behavioral problems. A subset of  participants completed a novel emotion recognition task (n = 46). Accuracy,  reaction time, total looking time, and number of fixations to the eyes and mouth  were measured. Twenty-two percent of youth with ASD scored above a cut-off  expected to identify the top 6% of CU scores. CU traits were associated with  longer reaction times to identify fear and fewer fixations to the eyes relative  to the mouth during the viewing of fearful faces. No associations were found  with accuracy or total looking time. Results suggest the mechanisms that  underpin CU traits may be similar between ASD and non-ASD populations.

Parsing profiles of temperamental reactivity and differential routes to delay of  gratification: A person-based approach.	Suor JH(1), Sturge-Apple ML(1), Jones-Gordils HR(1).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester.	Informed by a developmental psychopathology perspective, the present study  applied a person-based approach to examine whether associations between early  sociocontextual experiences (e.g., socioeconomic factors and maternal discipline  practices) and preschool-age children's delay of gratification vary across  profiles of children's temperamental reactivity. In addition, the study examined  the direct and mediating role of children's set shifting in associations with  delay of gratification within each profile. The sample consisted of 160  socioeconomically and ethnically diverse mothers and their 5-year-old children  drawn from a longitudinal study of mother-child relationships. Latent profile  analyses identified three profiles of temperamental reactivity distinguished by  sensitivity to reward and punishment and negative affectivity. Multigroup  analysis revealed maternal sensitive discipline (observed during a parent-child  compliance task) at age 3.5 predicted longer delay of gratification at age 5 in  the punishment reactivity/negative affectivity group. Maternal inductive  reasoning discipline at age 3.5 predicted longer delay in the low temperamental  reactivity group. For children with the reward reactivity/negative affectivity  profile, higher family income at age 3.5 predicted longer delay of gratification  at age 5, which was mediated by children's set shifting. Findings underscore the  utility of person-based approaches for delineating differential developmental  routes toward children's delay of gratification.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.	Tom Dishion, a pioneer in prevention science, was one of the first to recognize  the importance of adapting interventions to the needs of individual families.  Building towards this goal, we suggest that prevention trials be used to assess  baseline target moderated mediation (BTMM), where preventive intervention  effects are mediated through change in specific targets, and the resulting  effect varies across baseline levels of the target. Four forms of BTMM found in  recent trials are discussed including compensatory, rich-get-richer, crossover,  and differential iatrogenic effects. A strategy for evaluating meaningful  preventive effects is presented based on preventive thresholds for diagnostic  conditions, midpoint targets and proximal risk or protective mechanisms. Methods  are described for using the results from BTMM analyses of these thresholds to  estimate indices of intervention risk reduction or increase as they vary over  baseline target levels, and potential cut points are presented for identifying  subgroups that would benefit from program adaptation because of weak or  potentially iatrogenic program effects. Simulated data are used to illustrate  curves for the four forms of BTMM effects and how implications for adaptation  change when untreated control group outcomes also vary over baseline target  levels.

In 785 mother-child (50% male) pairs from a longitudinal epidemiological birth  cohort, we investigated associations between inflammation-related epigenetic  polygenic risk scores (i-ePGS), environmental exposures, cognitive function, and  child and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. We examined  prenatal and postnatal effects. For externalizing problems, one prenatal effect  was found: i-ePGS at birth associated with higher externalizing problems (ages  7-15) indirectly through lower cognitive function (age 7). For internalizing  problems, we identified two effects. For a prenatal effect, i-ePGS at birth  associated with higher internalizing symptoms via continuity in i-ePGS at age 7.  For a postnatal effect, higher postnatal adversity exposure (birth through age  7) associated with higher internalizing problems (ages 7-15) via higher i-ePGS  (age 7). Hence, externalizing problems were related mainly to prenatal effects  involving lower cognitive function, whereas internalizing problems appeared  related to both prenatal and postnatal effects. The present study supports a  link between i-ePGS and child and adolescent mental health.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418000330 PMID: 30068408 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Polygenic risk, family cohesion, and adolescent aggression in Mexican American  and European American families: Developmental pathways to alcohol use.	Elam KK(1), Chassin L(1), Pandika D(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University.	Poor family cohesion and elevated adolescent aggression are associated with  greater alcohol use in adolescence and early adulthood. In addition, evocative  gene-environment correlations (rGEs) can underlie the interplay between  offspring characteristics and negative family functioning, contributing to  substance use. Gene-environment interplay has rarely been examined in  racial/ethnic minority populations. The current study examined adolescents'  polygenic risk scores for aggression in evocative rGEs underlying aggression and  family cohesion during adolescence, their contributions to alcohol use in early  adulthood (n = 479), and differences between Mexican American and European  American subsamples. Results suggest an evocative rGE between polygenic risk  scores, aggression, and low family cohesion, with aggression contributing to low  family cohesion over time. Greater family cohesion was associated with lower  levels of alcohol use in early adulthood and this association was stronger for  Mexican American adolescents compared to European American adolescents. Results  are discussed with respect to integration of culture and racial/ethnic minority  samples into genetic research and implications for alcohol use.

Hope Family Center, Rochester, NY, USA. (3)Department of Educational Psychology, University of Nebraska Lincoln,  Lincoln, NE, USA.	The parent-child relationship undergoes substantial reorganization over the  transition to adolescence. Navigating this change is a challenge for parents  because teens desire more behavioral autonomy as well as input in  decision-making processes. Although it has been demonstrated that changes in  parental socialization approaches facilitates adolescent adjustment, very little  work has been devoted to understanding the underlying mechanisms supporting  parents' abilities to adjust caregiving during this period. Guided by  self-regulation models of parenting, the present study examined how parental  physiological and cognitive regulatory capacities were associated with hostile  and insensitive parent conflict behavior over time. From a process-oriented  perspective, we tested the explanatory role of parents' dysfunctional  child-oriented attributions in this association. A sample of 193 fathers,  mothers, and their early adolescent (ages 12-14) participated in  laboratory-based research assessments spaced approximately 1 year apart.  Parental physiological regulation was measured using square root of the mean of  successive differences during a conflict task; cognitive regulation was  indicated by set-shifting capacity. Results showed that parental difficulties in  vagal regulation during parent-adolescent conflict were associated with  increased hostile conflict behavior over time; however, greater set-shifting  capacity moderated this association for fathers only. In turn, father's  dysfunctional attributions regarding adolescent behavior mediated the moderating  effect. The results highlight how models of self-regulation and social cognition  may explain the determinants of hostile parenting with differential implications  for fathers during adolescence.

(2)Department of Psychology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA. (3)Department of Psychology, Trinity College, Hartford, CT, USA.	Although deficits in cognitive empathy are well established in individuals with  autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the literature on emotional empathy, or  emotional contagion, in individuals with ASD is sparse and contradictory. The  authors tested susceptibility to contagious yawning and laughter in children  with ASD (n = 60) and typically developing (TD) children (n = 60), ages 5-17  years, under various conditions, to elucidate factors that may affect emotional  contagion in these populations. Although TD children showed equal amounts of  emotional contagion across conditions, children with ASD were highly influenced  by the familiarity of the target stimulus, as well as task instructions that  encourage eye gaze to target. More specifically, children with ASD exhibited  less contagious yawning and laughter than their TD peers except when their  attention was explicitly directed to the eyes or (and even more so) when their  parents served as the stimulus targets. The authors explore the implications of  these findings for theories about the mechanisms underlying empathic deficits in  ASD as well as the clinical implications of having parents involved in  treatment.

(3)Columbia University. (4)University of Minnesota. (5)Brown University Alpert Medical School.	Body dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms are commonly experienced during  adolescence and increase the risk of adverse health outcomes, especially eating  disorders. However, the dominant temporal associations between these two  experiences (i.e., whether one is a risk factor for the other or the two are  mutually reinforcing) has yet to be fully explored. We examined the associations  between body dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms assessed at baseline and 5-  and 10-year follow-up in younger (M age = 12.9 years at baseline, 56% female, n  = 577) and older (M age = 15.9 years at baseline, 57% female, n = 1,325)  adolescent cohorts assessed as part of Project Eating Among Teens and Young  Adults. Associations between body dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms were  examined using cross-lagged models. For females, the dominant directionality was  for body dissatisfaction predicting later depressive symptoms. For males, the  picture was more complex, with developmentally sensitive associations in which  depressive symptoms predicted later body dissatisfaction in early adolescence  and early adulthood, but the reverse association was dominant during middle  adolescence. These findings suggest that interventions should be tailored to  dynamic risk profiles that shift over adolescence and early adulthood, and that  targeting body dissatisfaction at key periods during development may have  downstream impacts on depressive symptoms.

Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2019 Oct;31(4):1603.	The ability to regulate stress is a critical developmental milestone of early  childhood that involves a set of interconnected behavioral and physiological  processes and is influenced by genetic and environmental stimuli. Prenatal  exposure to traumatic stress and trauma, including intimate partner violence  (IPV), increases risk for offspring biobehavioral regulation problems during  childhood and adolescence. Although individual differences in susceptibility to  prenatal stress have been largely unexplored, a handful of studies suggest  children with specific genetic characteristics are most vulnerable to prenatal  stress. We evaluated the brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met gene (BDNF)  as a moderator of the effect of prenatal IPV exposure on infant temperamental  and cortisol regulation in response to a psychosocial challenge. Ninety-nine  mother-infant dyads recruited from the community were assessed when infants (51%  female) were 11 to 14 months. Maternal reports of IPV during pregnancy and  infant temperament were obtained, and infant saliva was collected for genotyping  and to assess cortisol reactivity (before and after the Strange Situation Task).  Significant genetic moderation effects were found. Among infants with the BDNF  Met allele, prenatal IPV predicted worse temperamental regulation and  mobilization of the cortisol response, while controlling for infant postnatal  exposure to IPV, other maternal traumatic experiences, and infant sex. However,  prenatal IPV exposure was not associated with temperamental or cortisol outcomes  among infant carriers of the Val/Val genotype. Findings are discussed in  relation to prenatal programming and biological susceptibility to stress.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418000329 PMID: 30068406 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Data from the in-school sample of the PROSPER preventive intervention  dissemination trial were used to investigate associations between alcohol  dehydrogenase genes and alcohol use across adolescence, and whether substance  misuse interventions in the 6th and 7th grades (targeting parenting, family  functioning, social norms, youth decision making, and peer group affiliations)  modified associations between these genes and adolescent use. Primary analyses  were run on a sample of 1,885 individuals and included three steps. First, we  estimated unconditional growth curve models with separate slopes for alcohol use  from 6th to 9th grade and from 9th to 12th grade, as well as the intercept at  Grade 9. Second, we used intervention condition and three alcohol dehydrogenase  genes, 1B (ADH1B), 1C (ADH1C), and 4 (ADH4) to predict variance in slopes and  intercept. Third, we examined whether genetic influences on model slopes and  intercepts were moderated by intervention condition. The results indicated that  the increase in alcohol use was greater in early adolescence than in middle  adolescence; two of the genes, ADH1B and ADH1C, significantly predicted early  adolescent slope and Grade 9 intercept, and associations between ADH1C and both  early adolescent slope and intercept were significantly different across control  and intervention conditions.

Cole DA(1), Zelkowitz RL(1), Nick EA(1), Lubarsky SR(1), Rights JD(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Human Development,Vanderbilt  University,Nashville, TN,USA.	Prior theory and research have linked negative appraisals (NA), emotion  reactivity (ER), and cognitive reactivity (CR) to depression; however, few  studies have examined whether even two of these constructs simultaneously, but  none have done so in child or adolescent populations. A total of 571 youths  (ages 9-13) completed a novel procedure in which all three constructs were  assessed in response to the same personally relevant, hypothetical, peer  victimization events. Multilevel modeling enabled the extraction of dynamic,  within-person, latent-variable measures of NA, ER, and CR. All three constructs  were related to children's depressive symptoms in ways that were commensurate  with most (but not all) theoretical frameworks. Gender and age differences also  emerged. Support for an NA-predicts-ER-predicts-CR model suggests ways that  these constructs can be integrated into a more complete, transtheoretical  understanding of the cognitive-emotional substrate of depression in children.

Cicchetti D(1), Handley ED(2).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development. (2)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	The present study examined the effect of various dimensions of child  maltreatment (i.e., developmental timing of maltreatment, number of maltreatment  subtypes, and chronicity of maltreatment) on methylation of the glucocorticoid  receptor gene, nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1 (NR3C1), and  investigated the associations between NR3C1 methylation and child outcomes.  Participants included 534 children who attended a research summer camp program  for school-aged maltreated (53.4%) and nonmaltreated (46.6%) children from low  socioeconomic backgrounds. Results show that children with early onset  maltreatment evidence significant hypermethylation compared to nonmaltreated  children. Moreover, more maltreatment subtypes experienced and more chronic  maltreatment are both related to greater NR3C1 hypermethylation. Findings also  indicate that hypermethylation of NR3C1 is linked with a number of negative  child outcomes including greater emotional lability-negativity, higher levels of  ego undercontrol, more externalizing behavior, and greater depressive symptoms.  Together, results highlight the role of methylation of NR3C1 in the effects of  child maltreatment on the development of emotion dysregulation and  psychopathology.

The current study addressed the  developmental progression and correlates of familism within the context of the  transition to adolescent motherhood. Participants were 191 Mexican-origin  pregnant adolescents (15 to 18 years of age at first pregnancy; Mage = 16.76  years; SD = 0.98) who were having their first child. Adolescents completed  interviews during their third trimester of pregnancy and annually for 5 years  after (Waves 1 through 6). We examined changes in familism values across the  transition to adolescent motherhood and the moderating role of age at pregnancy.  Moderation analyses revealed differences in familism trajectories for younger  versus older adolescents. We also examined whether familism values were related  to family relationship dynamics (i.e., adolescents' relationships with their own  mother figures) and adolescents' psychosocial adjustment, respectively, using  multilevel models to test both between-person and within-person associations.  Adolescents' stronger familism values were related to adolescent-mother figure  warmth and conflict, coparenting communication, and three dimensions of social  support from mother figures, but no associations emerged for coparental  conflict, adolescents' depressive symptoms, or self-esteem. Discussion addresses  these findings in the context of culturally grounded models of ethnic-racial  minority youth development and psychopathology.

Middle school peer reputation in high-achieving schools: Ramifications for  maladjustment versus competence by age 18.	Curlee AS(1), Aiken LS(1), Luthar SS(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University.	In an upper-middle class setting, we explored associations between students'  peer reputation in Grades 6 and 7 with adjustment at Grade 12. With a sample of  209 students, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of peer reputation dimensions  supported a 4-factor model (i.e., popular, prosocial, aggressive, isolated).  Structural equation models were used to examine prospective links between middle  school peer reputation and diverse Grade 12 adjustment indices, including  academic achievement (Scholastic Aptitude Test scores and grade point average),  internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and use of cigarettes, alcohol, and  marijuana. Prosocial reputation was connected to higher academic achievement  levels and fewer externalizing symptoms. Both prosocial and isolated reputations  were negatively associated with dimensions of substance use, whereas popularity  was positively associated. Implications for future research and interventions  are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418000275 PMID: 30037357 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The impact of childhood trauma and psychophysiological reactivity on at-risk  women's adjustment to parenthood.	Oosterman M(1), Schuengel C(1), Forrer ML(1), De Moor MHM(1).	Author information: (1)Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Section of Clinical Child and Family Studies,  and Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute.	Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have an impact on women's adaptation to  parenthood, but mechanisms are poorly understood. Autonomic nervous system  reactivity was tested as a potential mediating mechanism in a sample of 193  at-risk primiparous women. ACEs were measured retrospectively during pregnancy.  A baby cry-response task was administered during pregnancy while indicators of  sympathetic reactivity (pre-ejection period; PEP) and parasympathetic reactivity  (respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) were recorded. Parenting self-efficacy,  anxiety, and depressive symptoms were measured during pregnancy and 1 year after  giving birth. Harsh discipline was measured 2 years after giving birth.  Structural equation modeling was employed to test whether baseline PEP and RSA  and reactivity mediated links between ACEs and postnatal outcomes, adjusted for  prenatal variables. High ACEs predicted less RSA reactivity (p = .02), which  subsequently predicted increases in depressive symptoms (p = .03). The indirect  effect was not significant (p = .06). There was no indirect link between high  ACEs and harsh parenting through PEP nor RSA (n = 98). The parasympathetic  nervous system may be involved in negative affective responses in the transition  to parenthood among women exposed to childhood trauma.

Developmental trends of hot and cool executive function in school-aged children  with and without autism spectrum disorder: Links with theory of mind.	Kouklari EC(1), Tsermentseli S(1), Monks CP(1).	Author information: (1)University of Greenwich.	The development of executive function (EF) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has  been investigated using only "cool"-cognitive EF tasks while there is limited  knowledge regarding the development of "hot"-affective EF. Although cool EF  development and its links to theory of mind (ToM) have been widely examined,  understanding of the influence of hot EF to ToM mechanisms is minimal. The  present study introduced a longitudinal design to examine the developmental  changes in cool and hot EF of children with ASD (n = 45) and matched (to age and  IQ) controls (n = 37) as well as the impact of EF on ToM development over a  school year. For children with ASD, although selective cool (working memory and  inhibition) and hot (affective decision making) EF domains presented age-related  improvements, they never reached the performance level of the control group.  Early cool working memory predicted later ToM in both groups but early hot delay  discounting predicted later ToM only in the ASD group. No evidence was found for  the reverse pattern (early ToM predicting later EF). These findings suggest that  improvements in some EF aspects are evident in school age in ASD and highlight  the crucial role that both cool and hot EF play in ToM development.

Doom JR(1), Hazzard VM(1), Bauer KW(1), Clark CJ(2), Miller AL(1).	Author information: (1)University of Michigan. (2)Emory University.	While striving to succeed in the face of adversity may provide individuals with  outward benefits, it may come at a cost to individuals' physical health. The  current study examines whether striving predicts greater physiological or  psychosocial costs among those who experienced child maltreatment, a stressor  that disrupts the caregiving environment and threatens relationship security.  Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health,  we tested whether greater striving after childhood maltreatment would come at a  cost, increasing underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and depressive  symptoms despite showing outward success via income and college degree  attainment. The study included 13,341 Black, Hispanic, and White adolescents who  self-reported striving and their experiences of childhood neglect, physical  abuse, and sexual abuse. As young adults, participants reported depressive  symptoms, income, and college degree attainment and completed a health  assessment from which a 30-year Framingham-based CVD risk score was calculated.  Higher striving was associated with lower CVD risk and depressive symptoms, and  higher income and college degree attainment, regardless of maltreatment history.  These findings highlight the potential for striving as a target for  interventions and support the need to examine multiple biological and behavioral  outcomes to understand the multifaceted nature of resilience.

Social buffering of the maternal and infant HPA axes: Mediation and moderation  in the intergenerational transmission of adverse childhood experiences.	Thomas JC(1), Letourneau N(1), Campbell TS(1), Giesbrecht GF(1); Apron Study  Team.	Author information: (1)University of Calgary.	Supportive social relationships can reduce both psychological and physiological  responses to stressful experiences. Recently, studies have also assessed the  potential for social relationships to buffer the intergenerational transmission  of stress. The majority of these studies, however, have focussed on social  learning as a mechanism responsible for the intergenerational transmission of  stress. Evidence of biological mechanisms is lacking. The objective of the  current study was, therefore, to determine whether the association between  maternal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and infant  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function is mediated by maternal HPA  axis function during pregnancy and moderated by social support. Data were from  243 mother-infant dyads enrolled in a prospective longitudinal cohort (the  Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition Study). Maternal history of ACEs was  retrospectively assessed while maternal perceived social support and salivary  cortisol were assessed prospectively at 6-22 weeks gestation (Time 1) and 27-37  weeks gestation (Time 2), and infant cortisol reactivity to a laboratory  stressor and maternal perceived social support were assessed at 5-10 months  postnatal (Time 3). Results revealed that maternal HPA axis function during  pregnancy mediated the effects of maternal ACEs on infant HPA axis reactivity,  suggesting that the maternal HPA axis is a mechanism by which maternal early  life stress is transmitted to offspring. Furthermore, social support in the  prenatal and postnatal periods moderated the cascade from maternal ACEs to  infant HPA axis reactivity. Specifically, prenatal social support moderated the  association between ACEs and maternal HPA axis function during pregnancy, and  postnatal social support moderated the association between maternal HPA axis  function and infant cortisol reactivity. These findings highlight the social  sensitivity of the HPA axis and suggest the utility of social relationships as  an intervention target to reduce the effects of maternal early life stress on  infant outcomes.

Early-onset conduct problems (CP) are a key predictor of adult criminality and  poor mental health. While previous studies suggest that both genetic and  environmental risks play an important role in the development of early-onset CP,  little is known about potential biological processes underlying these  associations. In this study, we examined prospective associations between DNA  methylation (cord blood at birth) and trajectories of CP (4-13 years), using  data drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Methylomic  variation at seven loci across the genome (false discovery rate < 0.05)  differentiated children who go on to develop early-onset (n = 174) versus low (n  = 86) CP, including sites in the vicinity of the monoglyceride lipase (MGLL)  gene (involved in endocannabinoid signaling and pain perception). Subthreshold  associations in the vicinity of three candidate genes for CP (monoamine oxidase  A [MAOA], brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], and FK506 binding protein 5  [FKBP5]) were also identified. Within the early-onset CP group, methylation  levels of the identified sites did not distinguish children who will go on to  persist versus desist in CP behavior over time. Overall, we found that several  of the identified sites correlated with prenatal exposures, and none were linked  to known genetic methylation quantitative trait loci. Findings contribute to a  better understanding of epigenetic patterns associated with early-onset CP.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941700092X PMID: 28595673 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Allegrini AG(1), Evans BE(2), de Rooij S(1), Greaves-Lord K(3), Huizink AC(1).	Author information: (1)Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. (2)Radboud University. (3)Erasmus University Medical Center.	Dysregulated physiological stress reactivity has been suggested to impact the  development of children and adolescents with important health consequences  throughout the life span. Both environmental adversity and genetic  predispositions can lead to physiological imbalances in stress systems, which in  turn lead to developmental differences. We investigated genetic and  environmental contributions to autonomic nervous system reactivity to a  psychosocial stressor. Furthermore, we tested whether these effects were  consistent with the differential susceptibility framework. Composite measures of  adverse life events combined with socioeconomic status were constructed. Effects  of these adversity scores in interaction with a polygenic score summarizing six  genetic variants, which were hypothesized to work as susceptibility factors,  were tested on autonomic nervous system measures as indexed by heart rate and  heart rate variability. Results showed that carriers of more genetic variants  and exposed to high adversity manifested enhanced heart rate variability  reactivity to a psychosocial stressor compared to carriers of fewer genetic  variants. Conversely, the stress procedure elicited a more moderate response in  these individuals compared to carriers of fewer variants when adversity was low.

This study examined the impact of a school readiness intervention on external  response monitoring in children in foster care. Behavioral and event-related  potential (ERP) data were collected during a flanker task from children who  received the Kids In Transition to School (KITS) Program (n = 26) and children  who received services as usual (n = 19) before and after the intervention. While  there were no significant group differences on the behavioral data, the ERP data  for the two groups of children significantly differed. Specifically, in contrast  to the children who received services as usual, the children who received the  KITS Program displayed greater amplitude differences between positive and  negative performance feedback over time for the N1, which reflects early  attention processes, and feedback-related negativity, which reflects evaluation  processes. In addition, although the two groups did not differ on amplitude  differences between positive and negative performance feedback for these ERP  components before the intervention, the children who received the KITS Program  displayed greater amplitude differences than the children who received services  as usual after the intervention. These results suggest that the KITS Program had  an effect on responsivity to external performance feedback, which may be  beneficial during the transition into kindergarten.

(2)Pennsylvania State University. (3)University of Utah. (4)Incredible Years,Seattle. (5)University of Washington.	Low resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and to a lesser extent excessive  RSA reactivity to emotion evocation, are observed in many psychiatric disorders  characterized by emotion dysregulation, including syndromes spanning the  internalizing and externalizing spectra, and other conditions such as  nonsuicidal self-injury. Nevertheless, some inconsistencies exist. For example,  null outcomes in studies of RSA-emotion dysregulation relations are sometimes  observed among younger participants. Such findings may derive from use of age  inappropriate frequency bands in calculating RSA. We combine data from five  published samples (N = 559) spanning ages 4 to 17 years, and reanalyze RSA data  using age-appropriate respiratory frequencies. Misspecifying respiratory  frequencies results in overestimates of resting RSA and underestimates of RSA  reactivity, particularly among young children. Underestimates of developmental  shifts in RSA and RSA reactivity from preschool to adolescence were also  observed. Although correlational analyses revealed weak negative associations  between resting RSA and aggression, those with clinical levels of externalizing  exhibited lower resting RSA than their peers. No associations between RSA  reactivity and externalizing were observed. Results confirm that age-corrected  frequency bands should be used when estimating RSA, and that literature-wide  overestimates of resting RSA, underestimates of RSA reactivity, and  underestimates of developmental shifts in RSA and RSA reactivity may exist.

(2)Centre for Psychiatry Research, Department of Clinical Neuroscience,  Karolinska Institutet & Stockholm Health Care Services, Stockholm, Sweden. (3)Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with disrupted  emotional processes including impaired regulation of approach behavior and  positive affect, irritability, and anger. Enhanced reactivity to emotional cues  may be an underlying process. Pupil dilation is an indirect index of arousal,  modulated by the autonomic nervous system and activity in the locus  coeruleus-noradrenergic system. In the current study, pupil dilation was  recorded while 8- to 12- year old children (n = 71, 26 with a diagnosis of ADHD  and 45 typically developing), viewed images of emotional faces. Parent-rated  hyperactive/impulsive symptoms were uniquely linked to higher pupil dilation to  happy, but not fearful, angry, or neutral faces. This was not explained by  comorbid externalizing symptoms. Together, these results suggest that  hyperactive/impulsive symptoms are associated with hyperresponsiveness to  approach-related emotional cues across a wide range of symptom severity.

This study examined the long-term effects of a randomized controlled trial of  the Family Check-Up (FCU) intervention initiated at age 2 on inhibitory control  in middle childhood and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. We  hypothesized that the FCU would promote higher inhibitory control in middle  childhood relative to the control group, which in turn would be associated with  lower internalizing and externalizing symptomology at age 14. Participants were  731 families, with half (n = 367) of the families assigned to the FCU  intervention. Using an intent-to-treat design, results indicate that the FCU  intervention was indirectly associated with both lower internalizing and  externalizing symptoms at age 14 via its effect on increased inhibitory control  in middle childhood (i.e., ages 8.5-10.5). Findings highlight the potential for  interventions initiated in toddlerhood to have long-term impacts on  self-regulation processes, which can further reduce the risk for behavioral and  emotional difficulties in adolescence.

Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center, Eugene, OR, USA. (2)Department of Child and Family Studies, Yonsei University, Seoul, South  Korea.	Early adverse experiences are believed to have a profound effect on inhibitory  control and the underlying neural regions. In the current study, behavioral and  event-related potential (ERP) data were collected during a go/no-go task from  adolescents who were involved with the child welfare system due to child  maltreatment (n = 129) and low-income, nonmaltreated adolescents (n = 102). The  nonmaltreated adolescents were more accurate than the maltreated adolescents on  the go/no-go task, particularly on the no-go trials. Paralleling the results  with typically developing populations, the nonmaltreated adolescents displayed a  more pronounced amplitude of the N2 during the no-go trials than during the go  trials. However, the maltreated adolescents demonstrated a more pronounced  amplitude of the N2 during the go trials than during the no-go trials.  Furthermore, while the groups did not differ during the go trials, the  nonmaltreated adolescents displayed a more negative amplitude of the N2 than the  maltreated adolescents during no-go trials. In contrast, there was not a  significant group difference in amplitude of the P3. Taken together, these  results provide evidence that the early adverse experiences encountered by  maltreated populations impact inhibitory control and the underlying neural  activity in early adolescence.

Testing the CaR-FA-X model  longitudinally in community adolescents.	Gutenbrunner C(1), Salmon K(1), Jose PE(1).	Author information: (1)Victoria University of Wellington.	Overgeneral autobiographical memory, the tendency to report general memories  when asked to report specific event recollections, has been implicated in the  development and maintenance of psychopathology. The dominant model of  overgeneral memory, the CaR-FA-X model (Williams et al., 2007), proposes that  three cognitive processes (increased rumination and avoidance, and reduced  executive control) either independently, or in interaction, interfere with  successful memory retrieval. Although psychopathology increases significantly  during adolescence, no research has tested this model in its entirety, including  interaction effects, longitudinally in community youth. We tested the model with  323 adolescents (152 females, 171 males) across four annual assessment points.  Increased avoidance predicted higher proportions of overgeneral memories from  Time 3 to Time 4, but this association was stronger for youth with elevated  depressive symptoms across the four waves, and limited to memories generated in  response to negative cue words. This finding may indicate that youth with stable  higher levels of depression remember in an overgeneral way to avoid  re-elicitation of negative event-related emotions. In youth with lower  depression levels across time, the CaR-FA-X mechanisms did not predict  overgeneral memory.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418000457 PMID: 30394233 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)New York University. (2)Burke Medical Research Institute. (3)Emotional Brain Institute.	Children reared in impoverished environments are at risk for enduring  psychological and physical health problems. Mechanisms by which poverty affects  development, however, remain unclear. To explore one potential mechanism of  poverty's impact on social-emotional and cognitive development, an experimental  examination of a rodent model of scarcity-adversity was conducted and compared  to results from a longitudinal study of human infants and families followed from  birth (N = 1,292) who faced high levels of poverty-related scarcity-adversity.  Cross-species results supported the hypothesis that altered caregiving is one  pathway by which poverty adversely impacts development. Rodent mothers assigned  to the scarcity-adversity condition exhibited decreased sensitive parenting and  increased negative parenting relative to mothers assigned to the control  condition. Furthermore, scarcity-adversity reared pups exhibited decreased  developmental competence as indicated by disrupted nipple attachment, distress  vocalization when in physical contact with an anesthetized mother, and reduced  preference for maternal odor with corresponding changes in brain activation.  Human results indicated that scarcity-adversity was inversely correlated with  sensitive parenting and positively correlated with negative parenting, and that  parenting fully mediated the association of poverty-related risk with infant  indicators of developmental competence. Findings are discussed from the  perspective of the usefulness of bidirectional-translational research to inform  interventions for at-risk families.

Early adversity has been shown to sensitize individuals to the effects of later  stress and enhance risk of psychopathology. Using a longitudinal randomized  trial of foster care as an alternative to institutional care, we extend the  stress sensitization hypothesis to examine whether early institutional rearing  sensitizes individuals to stressful events in adolescence engendering chronic  low-grade inflammation. At baseline, institutionalized children in Romania (ages  6-31 months) were randomly assigned to foster care or to remain in usual care  within institutions. A group of never-institutionalized children was recruited  as an in-country comparison sample. At ages 12 and 16, participants reported  stressful events. At age 16, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP)  were derived from blood spots. Among children assigned to care as usual, more  stressful events at age 12, but not age 16, were associated with higher IL-6. In  the same group, stressful events at age 16 were associated with higher CRP,  though these effects attenuated after adjusting for covariates. These  associations were not observed in the foster care or never-institutionalized  groups. The findings suggest that heightened inflammation following stress  exposure is one pathway through which early neglect could compromise physical  health. In contrast, early family care might buffer against these risks.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001479 PMID: 33427183 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Children adopted internationally experience adverse conditions prior to  adoption, placing them at risk for problematic social-emotional development. The  Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention was designed to help  internationally adoptive parents behave in ways that promote young children's  social-emotional competence. Participants included 131 parent-child dyads  randomly assigned to receive either ABC (n = 65) or a control intervention (n =  66). In addition, 48 low-risk biologically related parent-child dyads were  included as a comparison group. At follow-up assessments conducted when children  were 24 to 36 months old, internationally adopted children who received the ABC  intervention had higher levels of parent-reported social-emotional competence  than children who received a control intervention. In addition, observational  assessments conducted when children were 48 and 60 months of age showed that  internationally adopted children who received ABC demonstrated higher  social-emotional competence than children who received a control intervention.  Adopted children who received the control intervention, but not the ABC  intervention, displayed more difficulties with social-emotional competence than  low-risk children. Finally, postintervention parent sensitivity mediated the  effect of ABC on observed child social-emotional competence in parent  interactions, controlling for preintervention parent sensitivity. These results  demonstrate the efficacy of a parenting-focused intervention in enhancing  social-emotional competence among children adopted internationally.

Banihashemi L(1), Wallace ML(1), Sheu LK(1), Lee MC(1), Gianaros PJ(1),  Mackenzie RP(1), Insana SP(1), Germain A(1), Herringa RJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh.	Limbic white matter pathways link emotion, cognition, and behavior and are  potentially malleable to the influences of traumatic events throughout  development. However, the impact of interactions between childhood and later  life trauma on limbic white matter pathways has yet to be examined. Here, we  examined whether childhood maltreatment moderated the effect of combat exposure  on diffusion tensor imaging measures within a sample of military veterans (N =  28). We examined five limbic tracts of interest: two components of the cingulum  (cingulum, cingulate gyrus, and cingulum hippocampus [CGH]), the uncinate  fasciculus, the fornix/stria terminalis, and the anterior limb of the internal  capsule. Using effect sizes, clinically meaningful moderator effects were found  only within the CGH. Greater combat exposure was associated with decreased CGH  fractional anisotropy (overall structural integrity) and increased CGH radial  diffusivity (perpendicular water diffusivity) among individuals with more severe  childhood maltreatment. Our findings provide preliminary evidence of the  moderating effect of childhood maltreatment on the relationship between combat  exposure and CGH structural integrity. These differences in CGH structural  integrity could have maladaptive implications for emotion and memory, as well as  provide a potential mechanism by which childhood maltreatment induces  vulnerability to later life trauma exposure.

(2)School of Nursing and Midwifery,Queen's University,Belfast,Northern  Ireland,UK.	We tested the hypothesis that high activity levels in infancy would predict  self-regulatory problems and later symptoms of attention deficit and  hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a longitudinal study of British families (N =  321). Infants' activity levels were assessed at 6 months, using 3 informants'  reports from the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ) and ActiGraphs during  baseline, attention, and restraint tasks. At a mean of 33 months, the children  were assessed on self-regulatory tasks; at a mean of 36 months, 3 informants  reported symptoms of ADHD. At a mean of 7.0 years, the children were assessed on  executive function tasks; 3 informants reported on the child's symptoms of ADHD;  and diagnoses of disorder were obtained using the Preschool Age Psychiatric  Assessment. Informants' reports of high activity levels at 6 months predicted  ADHD symptoms in early childhood and diagnoses of ADHD with clinical impairment  at age 7. The IBQ activity scale was also associated with the children's later  performance on self-regulation tasks in early and middle childhood. Activity  level in infancy reflects normal variation and is not a sign of psychopathology;  however, these findings suggest that further study of the correlates of high  activity level in infancy may help identify those children most at risk for  disorder.

The role of prenatal maternal stress in the development of childhood anxiety  symptomatology: The QF2011 Queensland Flood Study.	McLean MA(1), Cobham VE(1), Simcock G(1), Elgbeili G(2), Kildea S(1), King S(2).	Author information: (1)Mater Research Institute. (2)Douglas Mental Health University Institute.	It is possible that findings suggesting a link between prenatal maternal stress  (PNMS) and anxiety symptoms in offspring are confounded by postnatal and/or  shared mother-child heritability effects. Following exposure to a natural  disaster, the Queensland Flood Study investigated the unique and additive  effects of various types of disaster-related PNMS (objective hardship, cognitive  appraisal, and subjective distress) on childhood anxiety symptomatology  (internalizing and/or anxiety symptom measures). Timing of flood exposure during  pregnancy and child sex were examined as potential moderators. After controlling  for maternal psychosocial factors, greater objective hardship as a result of the  floods was significantly associated with greater anxiety symptoms (N = 114) and  marginally associated with greater internalizing behaviors (N = 115). Earlier  timing of the flood in pregnancy was associated with greater anxiety symptoms.  No such associations were found between any PNMS measure and teacher-rated child  internalizing behaviors (N = 90). Sex and timing did not moderate associations.  Our findings suggest that, in isolation, increased maternal hardship due to  exposure to an independent stressor, during pregnancy, may have a programming  effect on childhood anxiety symptoms.

Biological embedding of neighborhood disadvantage and collective efficacy:  Influences on chronic illness via accelerated cardiometabolic age.	Lei MK(1), Beach SRH(1), Simons RL(1).	Author information: (1)University of Georgia.	The present study extends prior research on the link between neighborhood  disadvantage and chronic illness by testing an integrated model in which  neighborhood characteristics exert effects on health conditions through  accelerated cardiometabolic aging. Hypotheses were tested using a sample of 408  African Americans from the Family and Community Health Study. Using four waves  of data spanning young adulthood (ages 18-29), we first found durable effects of  neighborhood disadvantage on accelerated cardiometabolic aging and chronic  illness. Then, we used marginal structural modeling to adjust for potential  neighborhood selection effects. As expected, accelerated cardiometabolic aging  was the biopsychosocial mechanism that mediated much of the association between  neighborhood disadvantage and chronic illness. This finding provides additional  support for the view that neighborhood disadvantage can influence morbidity and  mortality by creating social contexts that becomes biologically embedded.  Perceived neighborhood collective efficacy served to buffer the relationship  between neighborhood disadvantage and biological aging, identifying  neighborhood-level resilience factor. Overall, our results indicate that  neighborhood context serves as a fundamental cause of weathering and accelerated  biological aging. Residing in a disadvantaged neighborhood increases biological  wear and tear that ultimately leads to onset of chronic illness, but access to  perceived collective efficacy buffers the impact of these neighborhood effects.  From an intervention standpoint, identifying such an integrated model may help  inform future health-promoting interventions.

This study investigates suicide risk in late childhood and early adolescence in  relation to a family-centered intervention, the Family Check-Up, for problem  behavior delivered in early childhood. At age 2, 731 low-income families  receiving nutritional services from Women, Infants, and Children programs were  randomized to the Family Check-Up intervention or to a control group.  Trend-level main effects were observed on endorsement of suicide risk by parents  or teachers from ages 7.5 to 14, with higher rates of suicide risk endorsement  in youth in the control versus intervention condition. A significant indirect  effect of intervention was also observed, with treatment-related improvements in  inhibitory control across childhood predicting reductions in suicide-related  risk both at age 10.5, assessed via diagnostic interviews with parents and  youth, and at age 14, assessed via parent and teacher reports. Results add to  the emerging body of work demonstrating long-term reductions in suicide risk  related to family-focused preventive interventions, and highlight improvements  in youth self-regulatory skills as an important mechanism of such reductions in  risk.

Alcoholic family marital heterogeneity aggregates different child behavior  problems both pre- and postseparation.	Ip KI(1), Jester JM(1), Puttler LI(1), Zucker RA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Michigan.	Children of alcoholics (COAs) are at risk for elevated internalizing and  externalizing symptoms. Yet, little is known about the familial and behavioral  adjustments of COAs following parental separation. Using an  ecological-transactional framework, we examined how multiple risk factors  contributed to the formation of different alcoholic family structures and how  living in heterogeneous family structures affected COAs' behavioral problems.  The Michigan Longitudinal Study, a multiwave study on initially intact alcoholic  and control families with preschool-age children (n = 503), was used to evaluate  outcomes of offspring, when families either remained intact or were separated  when the child was aged 12-14. Alcoholic families who later transitioned into  stepfamilies were characterized with higher paternal antisociality, marital  aggression, and serious family crises than alcoholic families that remained  intact. COAs in stepfamilies (but not in single-parent families) exhibited  higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in preadolescence  compared with those in alcoholic intact families, in part because of elevated  behavioral risk at age 3. Structural equation modeling indicated that the  aggregated risk of stepfamily residence directly related to COAs' internalizing  and indirectly related to COAs' externalizing problems, partially mediated by  family stressors. Findings suggest targeting COAs in separated families for  early intervention.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418000561 PMCID: PMC6424672 PMID: 30227899 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Active coping moderates associations among race-related stress, rumination, and  depressive symptoms in emerging adult African American women.	Hill LK(1), Hoggard LS(2).	Author information: (1)Duke University. (2)Rutgers University-New Brunswick.	Cross-sectional and longitudinal research has shown that race-related stress is  associated with increased depressive symptoms among racial/ethnic minorities.  Rumination has long been considered a maladaptive self-regulatory response to  race-related stress, and growing evidence suggests that it may be an important  link in the relation between race-related stress and depression. More adaptive  forms of self-regulation, such as active coping, may counteract the negative  impact of rumination. We examined the influence of rumination on the relation  between race-related stress and depressive symptoms in a sample (N = 69) of  young adult (mean age = 20 ± 1.5 years) African American women. We also  considered the possible moderating effects of John Henryism, a form of  persistent and determined goal striving, and vagally mediated heart rate  variability, a purported biomarker of coping. Anticipatory race-related stress  was indirectly associated with depressive symptoms through rumination: estimate  = 0.07, 95% confidence interval [0.01, 0.16]. Both John Henryism and vagally  mediated heart rate variability moderated the relationship between race-related  stress and rumination; however, only John Henryism reliably influenced the  indirect association between race-related stress and depression through  rumination. We discuss these findings in the context of growing research  examining the interplay between cultural and biological factors in the risk for  poorer mental health.

Latent trajectories of alcohol use from early adolescence to young adulthood:  Interaction effects between 5-HTTLPR and parenting quality and gender  differences.	Su J(1), Supple AJ(2), Leerkes EM(2), Kuo SI(1).	Author information: (1)Virginia Commonwealth University. (2)University of North Carolina at Greensboro.	Using a large and nationally representative sample, we examined how adolescents'  5-HTTLPR genotype and perceived parenting quality independently and  interactively associated with trajectories of alcohol use from early adolescence  to young adulthood and whether/how gender may moderate these associations. The  sample for this study included 13,749 adolescents (53.3% female; 56.3%  non-Hispanic White, 21.5% Black, 16.0% Hispanic, and 6.1% Asian) followed  prospectively from adolescence to young adulthood. Using growth mixture  modeling, we identified four distinct trajectories of alcohol use (i.e.,  persistent heavy alcohol use, developmentally limited alcohol use, late-onset  heavy alcohol use, and non/light alcohol use). Results indicated that the short  allele of 5-HTTLPR was associated with higher risk of membership in the  persistent and the late-onset heavy alcohol use trajectories. Parenting quality  was associated with lower likelihoods of following the persistent heavy and the  developmentally limited alcohol use trajectories but was not associated with  risk of membership for the late-onset heavy drinking trajectory. 5-HTTLPR  interacted with parenting quality to predict membership in the persistent heavy  alcohol use trajectory for males but not for females. Findings highlighted the  importance of considering the heterogeneity in trajectories of alcohol use  across development and gender in the study of Gene Environment interactions in  alcohol use.

Assessing the interplay between multigenic and environmental influences on  adolescent to adult pathways of antisocial behaviors.	Li JJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin-Madison.	The current investigation utilized a developmental psychopathology approach to  test the hypothesis that multigenic (i.e., dopaminergic and serotonergic genes)  and multienvironmental factors interactively contribute to developmental  pathways of antisocial behavior (ASB). A sample of 8,834 Caucasian individuals  from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health)  were used to (a) examine the developmental pathways of ASB from age 13 to 32  using growth mixture modeling, (b) compute weighted multigenic risk scores (Add  Health MRS) for ASB from six well-characterized polymorphisms in dopamine and  serotonin genes, and (c) test the interaction between the Add Health MRS and a  measures of support (incorporating indicators of both positive and negative  support from parents and schools). Four pathways of adolescent to adult ASB  emerged from the growth mixture models: low, adolescence-peaked, high decline,  and persistent. Add Health MRS predicted the persistent ASB pathway, but not  other ASB pathways. Males with high Add Health MRS, but not low MRS, had  significantly greater odds of being in the adolescence-peaked pathway relative  to the low pathway at low levels of school connectedness. Nonfamilial  environmental influences during adolescence may have a cumulative impact on the  development of ASB, particularly among males with greater underlying genetic  risks.

Brain structural covariance network centrality in maltreated youth with PTSD and  in maltreated youth resilient to PTSD.	Sun D(1), Haswell CC(1), Morey RA(1), De Bellis MD(1).	Author information: (1)Duke University.	Child maltreatment is a major cause of pediatric posttraumatic stress disorder  (PTSD). Previous studies have not investigated potential differences in network  architecture in maltreated youth with PTSD and those resilient to PTSD.  High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging brain scans at 3 T were completed in  maltreated youth with PTSD (n = 31), without PTSD (n = 32), and nonmaltreated  controls (n = 57). Structural covariance network architecture was derived from  between-subject intraregional correlations in measures of cortical thickness in  148 cortical regions (nodes). Interregional positive partial correlations  controlling for demographic variables were assessed, and those correlations that  exceeded specified thresholds constituted connections in cortical brain  networks. Four measures of network centrality characterized topology, and the  importance of cortical regions (nodes) within the network architecture were  calculated for each group. Permutation testing and principle component analysis  method were employed to calculate between-group differences. Principle component  analysis is a methodological improvement to methods used in previous brain  structural covariance network studies. Differences in centrality were observed  between groups. Larger centrality was found in maltreated youth with PTSD in the  right posterior cingulate cortex; smaller centrality was detected in the right  inferior frontal cortex compared to youth resilient to PTSD and controls,  demonstrating network characteristics unique to pediatric maltreatment-related  PTSD. Larger centrality was detected in right frontal pole in maltreated youth  resilient to PTSD compared to youth with PTSD and controls, demonstrating  structural covariance network differences in youth resilience to PTSD following  maltreatment. Smaller centrality was found in the left posterior cingulate  cortex and in the right inferior frontal cortex in maltreated youth compared to  controls, demonstrating attributes of structural covariance network topology  that is unique to experiencing maltreatment. This work is the first to identify  cortical thickness-based structural covariance network differences between  maltreated youth with and without PTSD. We demonstrated network differences in  both networks unique to maltreated youth with PTSD and those resilient to PTSD.  The networks identified are important for the successful attainment of  age-appropriate social cognition, attention, emotional processing, and  inhibitory control. Our findings in maltreated youth with PTSD versus those  without PTSD suggest vulnerability mechanisms for developing PTSD.

Impulsivity as a mechanism linking child abuse and neglect with substance use in  adolescence and adulthood.	Oshri A(1), Kogan SM(1), Kwon JA(1), Wickrama KAS(1), Vanderbroek L(1), Palmer  AA(2), MacKillop J(1).	Author information: (1)University ofGeorgia. (2)University of Chicago.	Emerging developmental perspectives suggest that adverse rearing environments  promote neurocognitive adaptations that heighten impulsivity and increase  vulnerability to risky behavior. Although studies document links between harsh  rearing environments and impulsive behavior on substance use, the developmental  hypothesis that impulsivity acts as mechanism linking adverse rearing  environments to downstream substance use remains to be investigated. The present  study investigated the role of impulsivity in linking child abuse and neglect  with adult substance use using data from (a) a longitudinal sample of youth  (Study 1, N = 9,421) and (b) a cross-sectional sample of adults (Study 2, N =  1,011). In Study 1, the links between child abuse and neglect and young adult  smoking and marijuana use were mediated by increases in adolescent impulsivity.  In Study 2, indirect links between child abuse and neglect and substance use  were evidenced via delayed reward discounting and impulsivity traits. Among  impulsivity subcomponents, robust indirect effects connecting childhood  experiences to cigarette use emerged for negative urgency. Negative urgency,  positive urgency, and sensation seeking mediated the effect of child abuse and  neglect on cannabis and alcohol use. Results suggest that child abuse and  neglect increases risk for substance use in part, due to effects on impulsivity.  Individuals with adverse childhood experiences may benefit from substance use  preventive intervention programs that target impulsive behaviors.

Aggressive behavior in middle childhood can contribute to peer rejection,  subsequently increasing risk for substance use in adolescence. However, the  quality of peer relationships a child experiences can be associated with his or  her genetic predisposition, a genotype-environment correlation (rGE). In  addition, recent evidence indicates that psychosocial preventive interventions  can buffer genetic predispositions for negative behavior. The current study  examined associations between polygenic risk for aggression, aggressive  behavior, and peer rejection from 8.5 to 10.5 years, and the subsequent  influence of peer rejection on marijuana use in adolescence (n = 515; 256  control, 259 intervention). Associations were examined separately in control and  intervention groups for children of families who participated in a randomized  controlled trial of the family-based preventive intervention, the Family  Check-Up . Using time-varying effect modeling (TVEM), polygenic risk for  aggression was associated with peer rejection from approximately age 8.50 to  9.50 in the control group but no associations were present in the intervention  group. Subsequent analyses showed peer rejection mediated the association  between polygenic risk for aggression and adolescent marijuana use in the  control group. The role of rGEs in middle childhood peer processes and  implications for preventive intervention programs for adolescent substance use  are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001066 PMID: 33349288

Enduring effect of childhood maltreatment on cortisol and heart rate responses  to stress: The moderating role of severity of experiences.	Ouellet-Morin I(1), Robitaille MP(1), Langevin S(1), Cantave C(1), Brendgen  M(2), Lupien SJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Montreal. (2)University of Quebec at Montreal.	There is a relative consensus about the detrimental impact of childhood  maltreatment on later mental health problems and behavioral difficulties. Prior  research suggests that neurophysiological stress mechanisms may partly mediate  this association. However, inconsistent findings regarding  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic responses to stress  complicate this investigation. Furthermore, the concordance in these two stress  systems is not well understood. We tested whether the severity of maltreatment  affected the association between maltreatment and cortisol and heart rate (HR)  stress responses and the symmetry of these responses. Participants were 155  males (56 maltreated and 99 controls) aged 18 to 35 years. Cortisol and HR were  measured in response to the Trier Social Stress Test. Childhood maltreatment,  sociodemographic factors, and health-related factors were measured using  self-reported questionnaires. Maltreated participants had higher cortisol  responses to stress in comparison to controls. However, a shift from moderate to  lower to higher cortisol responses was noted as the severity of the experiences  increased. Participants exposed to more experiences of maltreatment also showed  a greater symmetry between cortisol and HR stress responses. Our findings  provide further support for persistent dysregulation of the HPA axis following  childhood maltreatment, of which the expression and symmetry with the  sympathetic system may change according to the severity of experiences.

Allocation of attention to scenes of peer harassment: Visual-cognitive  moderators of the link between peer victimization and aggression.

(3)Arizona State University.	As approximately one-third of peer-victimized children evidence heightened  aggression (Schwartz, Proctor, &amp; Chien, 2001), it is imperative to identify  the circumstances under which victimization and aggression co-develop. The  current study explored two potential moderators of victimization-aggression  linkages: (a) attentional bias toward cues signaling threat and (b) attentional  bais toward cues communicating interpersonal support. Seventy-two fifth- and  sixth-grade children (34 boys; Mage = 11.67) were eye tracked while watching  video clips of bullying. Each scene included a bully, a victim, a reinforcer,  and a defender. Children's victimization was measured using peer, parent, and  teacher reports. Aggression was measured using peer reports of overt and  relational aggression and teacher reports of aggression. Victimization was  associated with greater aggression at high levels of attention to the bully.  Victimization was also associated with greater aggression at low attention to  the defender for boys, but at high attention to the defender for girls.  Attention to the victim was negatively correlated with aggression regardless of  victimization history. Thus, attentional biases to social cues integral to the  bullying context differentiate whether victimization is linked to aggression,  necessitating future research on the development of these biases and concurrent  trajectories of sociobehavioral development.

How children's anxiety symptoms impact the functioning of the  hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis over time: A cross-lagged panel approach  using hierarchical linear modeling.	Ma D(1), Serbin LA(1), Stack DM(1).	Author information: (1)Concordia University.	Anxiety symptoms in childhood and adolescence can have a long-term negative  impact on mental and physical health. Although studies have shown dysregulation  of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis is associated with anxiety disorders,  it is unclear how and in what direction children's experiences of anxiety  symptoms, which include physiological and cognitive-emotional dimensions, impact  the functioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis over time. We  hypothesized that higher physiological symptoms would be contemporaneously  associated with hypercortisolism, whereas cognitive-emotional symptoms would be  more chronic, reflecting traitlike stability, and would predict hypocortisolism  over time. One hundred twenty children from the Concordia Longitudinal Risk  Research Project were followed in successive data collection waves approximately  3 years apart from childhood through midadolescence. Between ages 10-12 and  13-15, children completed self-report questionnaires of anxiety symptoms and  provided salivary cortisol samples at 2-hr intervals over 2 consecutive days.  The results from hierarchical linear modeling showed that higher physiological  symptoms were concurrently associated with hypercortisolism, involving cortisol  levels that remained elevated over the day. In contrast, longitudinal results  over the 3 years between data collection waves showed that chronic worry and  social concerns predicted hypocortisolism, showing a low and blunted diurnal  cortisol profile. These results have implications for broadening our  understanding of the links between anxiety, the stress response system, and  health across the course of development.

Dimension-specific symptom patterns in trajectories of broad anxiety: A  longitudinal prospective study in school-aged children.	Ahlen J(1), Ghaderi A(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,  Sweden.	Theories of maladaptive anxiety in children have suggested different  developmental trajectories across age. Weems (2008) suggested that one subgroup  of children demonstrates high and stable levels of broad anxiety, but shifting  levels of dimension-specific symptoms in part due to related normative  challenges. In a prospective longitudinal design, the current study examined  patterns of dimension-specific anxiety symptoms in subgroups of children  following different developmental trajectories of broad anxiety. A total of 300  children (150 girls, 150 boys) ages 8-11 at baseline, completed the Spence  Children's Anxiety Scale four times over 3 years. Using latent class growth  mixture modeling, we found evidence of three subgroups of children following  different trajectories of broad anxiety across age: low-stable,  moderate-increasing, and high-decreasing. Compared with other children, the  subgroup with moderate and increasing levels of broad anxiety demonstrated an  initially higher level of separation anxiety with larger improvement across time  but, initially, similar levels of generalized and social anxiety with a larger  increase across age. High broad anxiety was partly carried by different sets of  dimension-specific symptoms at different ages, which suggests that children with  high levels of broad anxiety across time may be more sensitive to normative  challenges that happen in typical child development.

Intergenerational transmission of violence: The mediating role of adolescent  psychopathology symptoms.	Low S(1), Tiberio SS(2), Shortt JW(2), Mulford C(3), Eddy JM(4), Capaldi DM(2).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University. (2)Oregon Social Learning Center. (3)National Institute of Justice. (4)New York University.	Evidence on the intergenerational continuity of intimate partner violence (IPV)  suggests small to moderate associations between childhood exposure and young  adult IPV involvement, suggesting an indirect effects model. Yet, few  prospective studies have formally tested meditational mechanisms. The current  study tested a prospective (over 9 years) moderated-mediational model in which  adolescent psychopathology symptoms (i.e., internalizing, externalizing, and  combined) mediated the association between exposure to IPV in middle childhood  and young adult IPV perpetration. In a more novel contribution, we controlled  for proximal young adult partner and relationship characteristics. The sample  consisted of n = 205 participants, who were, on average, assessed for exposure  to parent IPV at age 12.30 years, adolescent psychopathology symptoms at age  15.77 years, and young adult IPV at 21.30 years of age. Data suggest a small,  significant direct path from IPV exposure to young adult perpetration, mediated  only through adolescent externalizing. Gender moderation analyses reveal  differences in sensitivity to exposure across developmental periods; for males,  effects of exposure were intensified during the transition to adolescence,  whereas for females, effects were amplified during the transition to adulthood.  In both cases, the mediational role of psychopathology symptoms was no longer  significant once partner antisocial behavior was modeled. Findings have  important implications for both theory and timing of risk conveyance.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417001833 PMID: 29233201 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Childhood quality influences genetic sensitivity to environmental influences  across adulthood: A life-course Gene × Environment interaction study.	Keers R(1), Pluess M(1).	Author information: (1)Queen Mary University of London.	While environmental adversity has been shown to increase risk for  psychopathology, individuals differ in their sensitivity to these effects. Both  genes and childhood experiences are thought to influence sensitivity to the  environment, and these factors may operate synergistically such that the effects  of childhood experiences on later sensitivity are greater in individuals who are  more genetically sensitive. In line with this hypothesis, several recent studies  have reported a significant three-way interaction (Gene × Environment ×  Environment) between two candidate genes and childhood and adult environment on  adult psychopathology. We aimed to replicate and extend these findings in a  large, prospective multiwave longitudinal study using a polygenic score of  environmental sensitivity and objectively measured childhood and adult material  environmental quality. We found evidence for both Environment × Environment and  Gene × Environment × Environment effects on psychological distress. Children  with a poor-quality material environment were more sensitive to the negative  effects of a poor environment as adults, reporting significantly higher  psychological distress scores. These effects were further moderated by a  polygenic score of environmental sensitivity. Genetically sensitive children  were more vulnerable to adversity as adults, if they had experienced a poor  childhood environment but were significantly less vulnerable if their childhood  environment was positive. These findings are in line with the differential  susceptibility hypothesis and suggest that a life course approach is necessary  to elucidate the role of Gene × Environment in the development of mental  illnesses.

Enhancing diurnal cortisol regulation among young children adopted  internationally: A randomized controlled trial of a parenting-based  intervention.

(2)Department of Psychology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA. (3)Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Delaware,  Newark, DE, USA.	Children who have been adopted internationally commonly experience institutional  care and other forms of adversity prior to adoption that can alter the  functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In particular,  internationally adopted children tend to have blunted diurnal declines compared  to children raised in their birth families. The Attachment and Biobehavioral  Catch-Up (ABC) intervention was developed to enhance young children's biological  and behavioral regulation by promoting sensitive parenting. The current study  used a randomized controlled trial to assess whether ABC improved the diurnal  functioning of the HPA axis among 85 children who had been adopted  internationally when they were between the ages of 4 and 33 months (M = 16.12).  Prior to the intervention, there were no significant differences in diurnal  cortisol production between children whose parents were randomly assigned to  receive ABC and children whose parents were randomly assigned to receive a  control intervention. After the intervention, children whose parents had  received the ABC intervention exhibited steeper declines in cortisol levels  throughout the day than children whose parents had received the control  intervention. These results indicate that the ABC intervention is effective in  enhancing a healthy pattern of diurnal HPA axis regulation for young children  who have been adopted internationally.

Children's stress regulation mediates the association between prenatal maternal  mood and child executive functions for boys, but not girls.

Author information: (1)University of British Columbia,BC Children's Hospital Research Institute.	Prenatal exposure to maternal mood disturbances shapes children's cognitive  development reflected in the critical construct of executive functions (EFs).  Little is known, however, about underlying mechanisms. By examining cortisol  responses in both everyday and lab challenge settings, we tested whether the  child/offspring hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis mediates effects of prenatal  maternal mood on child EFs at age 6. In 107 Canadian children born to women with  a wide range of anxious and depressive symptoms during pregnancy, we found that  in boys but not girls, depressed and/or anxious prenatal maternal mood is  associated with heightened diurnal cortisol levels in everyday settings, as well  as heightened cortisol reactivity to a lab challenge and that this heightened  reactivity was associated with poorer EFs. Among boys we also observed that  cortisol reactivity but not diurnal cortisol mediated the association between  depressed and/or anxious prenatal maternal mood and EFs. Depressed and/or  anxious prenatal maternal mood was related to child EFs for both girls and boys.  To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a mediating role for  child stress regulation in the association between prenatal maternal  stress-related mood disturbances and child EFs, providing evidence of a  mechanism contributing to fetal programming of cognition.

Finegood ED(1), Rarick JRD(1), Blair C(1); Family Life Project Investigators.	Author information: (1)New York University.	Children who grow up in poverty are more likely to experience chronic stressors  that generate "wear" on stress regulatory systems including the  hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This can have long-term consequences  for health and well-being. Prior research has examined the role of proximal  family and home contributions to HPA axis functioning. However, there is  evidence to suggest that more distal levels of context, including neighborhoods,  also matter. Prior evidence has primarily focused on adolescents and adults,  with little evidence linking the neighborhood context with HPA activity in  infancy and toddlerhood. We tested whether neighborhood disadvantage (indexed by  US Census data) was associated with basal salivary cortisol levels at 7, 15, and  24 months of child age in a large sample of families (N = 1,292) residing in  predominately low-income and rural communities in the United States. Multilevel  models indicated that neighborhood disadvantage was positively associated with  salivary cortisol levels and that this effect emerged across time. This effect  was moderated by the race/ethnicity of children such that the association was  only observed in White children in our sample. Findings provide preliminary  evidence that the neighborhood context is associated with stress regulation  during toddlerhood, elucidating a need for future work to address possible  mechanisms.

Comment on     Dev Psychopathol. 2018 Feb;30(1):93-112.	Recently in this journal, Weeland et al. (2018) published a thought-provoking  article reporting moderating effects of children's serotonin transporter-linked  polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR) on negative parenting during prevention with the  Incredible Years series. Participants were parents and young children of 387  families enrolled in the Observational Randomized Control Trial of Childhood  Differential Susceptibility study. An equally important finding, which we focus  on in this comment, involved null effects for all tests of parenting as a  mediator of prevention-induced improvements in children's externalizing  behavior. Although such findings may seem surprising, both confirmations of and  failures to confirm parenting change as a mediator of child behavior change are  common in the prevention and intervention literatures. In this comment, we  explore likely reasons for heterogeneity in findings, including both moderators  of treatment effect size and methods used to test mediation. Common moderators  of prevention and intervention response to Incredible Years include dose,  parenting problems at intake, high-risk versus clinical nature of samples, how  parenting is measured, and whether child training is included with parent  training. All of these moderators affect power to detect mediation. We then  discuss conceptual criteria for testing mediation in randomized clinical trials,  and problems with interpreting mediating paths in cross-lag panel models.  Although the gene effect reported by Weeland et al. is important, their  cross-lag panel models do not provide strong tests of parenting as a mediator of  child behavior change. We conclude with recommendations for testing mediation in  randomized clinical trials.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418000810 PMID: 30179149 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Intimate partner violence as a mechanism underlying the intergenerational  transmission of maltreatment among economically disadvantaged mothers and their  adolescent daughters.	Adams TR(1), Handley ED(1), Manly JT(1), Cicchetti D(1), Toth SL(1).	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester.	Child maltreatment represents a pervasive societal problem. Exposure to  maltreatment is predictive of maladjustment across development with enduring  negative effects found in adulthood. Compelling evidence suggests that some  parents with a history of child abuse and neglect are at elevated risk for the  maltreatment of their own children. However, a dearth of research currently  exists on mediated mechanisms that may underlie this continuity. Ecological and  transactional theories of child maltreatment propose that child maltreatment is  multiply determined by various risk factors that exist across different  ecological systems. Intimate partner violence (IPV) often co-occurs with child  maltreatment and may represent a pathway through which risk for child abuse and  neglect is transmitted across generations within a family. Informed by theories  on the intergenerational transmission of child maltreatment and utilizing a  community-based, cross-sectional sample of 245 racially and ethnically diverse,  low-income mothers and daughters, the objective of this study was to investigate  IPV as a propagating process through which risk of child abuse and neglect is  conferred from parent to child. We found evidence suggesting that mothers'  history of maltreatment is associated with both their IPV involvement and their  adolescent daughters' maltreatment victimization (with exposure to IPV as a  maltreatment subtype excluded for clarity). Maternal IPV also partially  accounted for the continuity of maltreatment victimization from mother to  adolescent. A secondary analysis that included the adolescent's own engagement  in dating violence provided compelling but preliminary evidence of the emergence  of a similar pattern of relational violence, whereby adolescent girls with  maltreatment histories were likewise involved in abusive intimate relationships.  Future directions and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418001505 PMCID: PMC7175628 PMID: 30554572

(3)Department of Psychological Science, University of California, Irvine,  Irvine, CA, USA.	Physiological regulation may interact with early experiences such as  maltreatment to increase risk for behavior problems. In the current study, we  investigate the role of parasympathetic nervous system regulation (respiratory  sinus arrhythmia [RSA] at rest and in response to a frustration task) as a  moderator of the association between early risk for maltreatment (i.e.,  involvement with Child Protective Services; CPS) and externalizing behavior  problems in middle childhood. CPS involvement was associated with elevated  externalizing problems, but only among children with average to high RSA at rest  and average to high RSA withdrawal in response to frustration. Effects appeared  to be specific to CPS involvement as the association between cumulative risk  (i.e., nonmaltreatment experiences of early adversity) and externalizing  problems was not significantly moderated by RSA activity. These findings are  consistent with the theoretical idea that the consequences of early maltreatment  for later externalizing behavior problems depend on children's biological  regulation abilities.

Dagan O(1), Asok A(2), Steele H(1), Steele M(1), Bernard K(3).	Author information: (1)New School for Social Research. (2)Columbia University. (3)Stony Brook University.	Exposure to childhood adversity has been linked to accelerated telomere  shortening, a marker of cellular aging and an indicator of physical health risk.  In the current study, we examined whether adult attachment representation  moderated the association between childhood adversity and telomere length.  Participants included 78 young adults (M age = 20.46, SD = 1.57), who reported  on their exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and were administered  the Adult Attachment Interview, which was coded for attachment state of mind.  Relative telomere length was assayed from buccal cells. Multiple regression  analyses revealed a significant interaction between attachment state of mind and  ACE in predicting telomere length. Whereas the association between number of ACE  and telomere length was nonsignificant for secure-autonomous, r (50) = -.15, p =  .31, and insecure-preoccupied young adults, r (9) = -.15, p = .71, there was a  strong negative association between number of ACE and telomere length for  insecure-dismissing young adults, r (19) = -.59, p = .007. This study is novel  in demonstrating that attachment may affect biological resilience following  childhood adversity, contributing to the growing literature about the role of  the quality of early caregiving experiences and their representations in shaping  biological processes and physical health.

Author information: (1)Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Radcliffe  Observatory, Anna Watts Building, Oxford, UK.	Resilience is a dynamic process depicted by better than expected levels of  functioning in response to significant adversity. This can be assessed  statistically, by taking the residuals from a model of psychological functioning  regressed onto negative life events. We report the first study to investigate  multiple cognitive factors in relation to this depiction of resilient  functioning. Life events, internalizing symptoms, and a range of cognitive risk  and protective factors were assessed in a large sample of adolescents (N = 504)  across three waves spaced 12-18 months apart. Adolescents who displayed fewer  symptoms than expected, relative to negative life events, were considered more  resilient. Adolescents who displayed more symptoms than expected, relative to  negative life events, were considered less resilient. All cognitive factors were  associated with resilient functioning to differing degrees. These included  memory bias, interpretation bias, worry, rumination, self-esteem, and  self-reported trait resilience. Regression models showed that memory bias was a  key factor explaining unique variance in prospective resilient functioning. In a  subsequent cross-lagged panel model, memory bias and resilient functioning were  reinforcing mechanisms across time points, supporting cognitive models of  emotional resilience. This study adds to the literature, by highlighting key  cognitive mechanisms as potential intervention targets.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000668 PMID: 32672146

Different factors predict adolescent substance use versus adult substance abuse:  Lessons from a social-developmental approach.	Allen JP(1), Loeb EL(1), Narr RK(1), Costello MA(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.	This 17-year prospective study applied a social-developmental lens to the  challenge of distinguishing predictors of adolescent-era substance use from  predictors of longer term adult substance use problems. A diverse community  sample of 168 individuals was repeatedly assessed from age 13 to age 30 using  test, self-, parent-, and peer-report methods. As hypothesized, substance use  within adolescence was linked to a range of likely transient social and  developmental factors that are particularly salient during the adolescent era,  including popularity with peers, peer substance use, parent-adolescent conflict,  and broader patterns of deviant behavior. Substance abuse problems at ages 27-30  were best predicted, even after accounting for levels of substance use in  adolescence, by adolescent-era markers of underlying deficits, including lack of  social skills and poor self-concept. The factors that best predicted levels of  adolescent-era substance use were not generally predictive of adult substance  abuse problems in multivariate models (either with or without accounting for  baseline levels of use). Results are interpreted as suggesting that recognizing  the developmental nature of adolescent-era substance use may be crucial to  distinguishing factors that predict socially driven and/or relatively transient  use during adolescence from factors that predict long-term problems with  substance abuse that extend well into adulthood.

(2)Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON,  Canada. (3)Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON,  Canada.	Studies have long observed the bidirectional nature of mother-infant  relationships. While behavioral studies have shown that mothers high in social  avoidance tendencies can influence the development of these traits in their  offspring, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, and the  role that the infants play, are not well understood. Here we acquired frontal  electroencephalogram asymmetry (FA) data simultaneously in 40 mother-infant  dyads (Mage mother = 31.6 years; Mage infant = 9 months). Using an actor-partner  interdependence model, we examined whether mother (or infant) resting-state FA  predicted infant (or mother) FA during two subsequent emotion-eliciting  conditions (happy and fear). Maternal social approach versus avoidance traits  were assessed as moderators to examine the impact of maternal characteristics on  these mother-infant FA relations. In dyads led by mothers with high social  avoidance/low social approach characteristics, maternal resting-state FA  predicted infant FA during both emotion-eliciting conditions. We did not observe  any effects of infant FA on mothers. Therefore, we speculate that individual  differences in FA patterns might be a putative brain mechanism through which  socially avoidant mothers transfer affective/behavioral information to their  infants.

Potential long-term associations between repetitive negative thinking and  mother-infant interactions have received little attention. The current  longitudinal study including N = 62 mother-infant dyads investigated both  maternal and infant behavior in face-to-face interactions as a function of pre-  and postnatal maternal repetitive negative thinking when infants were aged  around 4 months. We hypothesised that mothers with a strong tendency to engage  in repetitive negative thinking would react less contingently to their infants'  behavior compared to mothers with a weak tendency to engage in repetitive  negative thinking. Furthermore, we hypothesised that infants of mothers high in  repetitive negative thinking would differ from infants of mothers low in  repetitive negative thinking in their reactions in the still-face task. Contrary  to expectations, there was no difference in maternal contingency between mothers  high versus low in repetitive negative thinking. However, infant behavior in the  still-face task differed as a function of maternal repetitive negative thinking  status. Specifically, infants of mothers high in repetitive negative thinking  spent more time with object/environment engagement than infants of mothers who  were low in repetitive negative thinking, and they also protested less  frequently. These findings are discussed in terms of their relevance for the  intergenerational transmission of mental disorders.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418000883 PMID: 30585563 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Dora B(1), Baydar N(1).	Author information: (1)Psychology Department, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey.	A large and growing body of research suggests that maternal depressive symptoms  and child externalizing behaviors are strongly associated. Theoretical arguments  supported by these findings led to the question of whether maternal depressive  symptoms are transactionally associated with child externalizing behaviors.  Using 5-year nationally representative longitudinal data from Turkey (N =  1,052), we estimated a transactional bivariate autoregressive latent trajectory  model addressing this question. This model disaggregated the association of the  two processes into two components: (a) the association of the interindividual  differences in the trajectories; and (b) the intradyad association of the  changes in maternal depressive symptoms with the changes in child externalizing  behaviors. Although maternal depressive symptoms were robustly associated with  child externalizing behaviors at age 3, the transactional associations of the  two processes were small prior to age 5 and absent at ages 5 to 7. Furthermore,  maternal harsh parenting did not have a mediating role in the limited  transactional association of maternal depressive symptoms with child  externalizing behaviors.

Parents' early representations of their children moderate socialization  processes: Evidence from two studies.	An D(1), Kochanska G(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, The University of Iowa, Iowa,  IA, USA.	Difficult infants are commonly considered at risk for maladaptive developmental  cascades, but evidence is mixed, prompting efforts to elucidate moderators of  effects of difficulty. We examined features of parents' representations of their  infants - adaptive (appropriate mind-mindedness, MM) and dysfunctional (low  reflective functioning, RF, hostile attributions) - as potential moderators. In  Family Study (N = 102), we tested parents' appropriate MM comments to their  infants as moderating a path from infants' observed difficulty (negative affect,  unresponsiveness) to parents' observed power assertion at ages 2-4.5 to  children's observed and parent-rated (dis)regard for conduct rules at age 5.5.  In father-child relationships, MM moderated that path: for fathers with low MM,  the infants' increasing difficulty was associated with fathers' greater power  assertion, which in turn was associated with children's more disregard for  rules. The path was absent for fathers with average or high MM. In Children and  Parents Study (N = 200), dysfunctional representations (low RF, hostile  attributions) moderated the link between child objective difficulty, observed as  anger in laboratory episodes, and difficulty as described by the parent. Reports  of mothers with highly dysfunctional representations were unrelated to  children's observed anger. Reports of mothers with average or low dysfunctional  representations aligned with laboratory observations.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001546 PMID: 33342459

Parenteau AM(1), Alen NV(1), Deer LK(1), Nissen AT(1), Luck AT(1), Hostinar  CE(1).	Author information: (1)Psychology Department, University of California, Davis, CA, USA.	Parents serve important functions in regulating children's responses to stress  and challenge. However, the parental characteristics that modulate the  effectiveness of parents as stress buffers remain to be fully characterized. To  address this gap, this study examined parental characteristics and behaviors  that may explain variation in parents' ability to buffer cortisol responses to  acute stress of 180 children (ages 9-11 years old, M = 9.9 years, SD = .58).  Children were randomly assigned to either participate in a public speaking task,  the Trier Social Stress Test - modified for children (TSST-M) or a control  condition. Children in the TSST-M condition were randomly assigned to prepare  for the public speaking task either with their parent (N = 59) or alone (N =  60), whereas 61 children were assigned to the control condition (no TSST-M). We  found that parental education moderated the effect of condition on children's  responses to acute stress. Children whose parents had lower levels of education  exhibited reduced cortisol responses in the parent condition compared to the  alone condition, showing a buffered pattern of reactivity. In contrast, children  of parents with high levels of education displayed higher cortisol reactivity in  the parent condition compared to the alone and control conditions. Parental  education was also positively associated with higher levels of state anxiety  within the parent condition. These results suggest that highly educated parents  may emphasize performance over comfort, amplifying their children's state  anxiety and cortisol responses to a public performance.

Reports of perceived racial discrimination among African American children  predict negative affect and smoking behavior in adulthood: A sensitive period  hypothesis.	Gibbons FX(1), Fleischli ME(1), Gerrard M(1), Simons RL(2).	Author information: (1)University of Connecticut. (2)University of Georgia.	We examined the prospective relations between a cultural risk factor, perceived  racial discrimination (PRD), and subsequent negative affect and health behavior  (smoking) in a panel of 889 African American children (part of the Family and  Community Health Study). Cultural moderators (protective factors) of these  relations were also examined. PRD was assessed six times from ages 10.5 (Wave 1)  to 24.5 (Wave 6), and negative affect (anger and depressive symptoms) was  assessed at Wave 2 (age 12.5) and Wave 6 (age 24.5). Results indicated that Wave  1 PRD predicted Wave 6 smoking, controlling for multiple factors related to  smoking and/or PRD, including smoking at age 15.5. Structural equation models  indicated that these relations between Wave 1 PRD and smoking were mediated by  both early and later negative affect. The models also indicated that Wave 1 PRD  had a direct impact on Wave 6 anger (assessed 14 years later), controlling for  the effects of PRD on early affect. Cultural socialization was associated with  lower rates of adolescent smoking, and it buffered the relation between PRD and  Wave 6 anger. The impact of early PRD experiences along with suggestions for  culturally informed interventions and preventive interventions that might buffer  against early PRD effects are discussed.

Author information: (1)Prevention Science Institute, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA.	This study evaluated the efficacy of a family-centered preventive intervention,  the Family Check-Up (FCU), delivered as an online, eHealth model to middle  school families. To increase accessibility of family-centered prevention in  schools, we adapted the evidence-based FCU to an online format, with the goal of  providing a model of service delivery that is feasible, given limited staffing  and resources in many schools. Building on prior research, we randomly assigned  participants to waitlist control (n = 105), FCU Online as a web-based  intervention (n = 109), and FCU Online with coaching support (n = 108). We  tested the effects of the intervention on multiple outcomes, including parental  self-efficacy, child self-regulation, and child behavior, in this registered  clinical trial (NCT03060291). Families engaged in the intervention at a high  rate (72% completed the FCU assessment) and completed 3-month posttest  assessments with good retention (94% retained). Random assignment to the FCU  Online with coaching support was associated with reduced emotional problems for  children (p = .003, d = -0.32) and improved parental confidence and  self-efficacy (p = .018, d = 0.25) when compared with waitlist controls. Risk  moderated effects: at-risk youth showed stronger effects than did those with  minimal risk. The results have implications for online delivery of  family-centered interventions in schools.

Affective family interactions and their associations with adolescent depression:  A dynamic network approach.	Bodner N(1), Kuppens P(1), Allen NB(2), Sheeber LB(3), Ceulemans E(1).	Author information: (1)University of Leuven. (2)University of Oregon. (3)Oregon Research Institute.	The prevalence of depression rises steeply during adolescence. Family processes  have been identified as one of the important factors that contribute to affect  (dys)regulation during adolescence. In this study, we explored the affect  expressed by mothers, fathers, and adolescents during a problem-solving  interaction and investigated whether the patterns of the affective interactions  differed between families with depressed adolescents and families with  nondepressed adolescents. A network approach was used to depict the frequencies  of different affects, concurrent expressions of affect, and the temporal  sequencing of affective behaviors among family members. The findings show that  families of depressed adolescents express more anger than families of  nondepressed adolescents during the interaction. These expressions of anger  co-occur and interact across time more often in families with a depressed  adolescent than in other families, creating a more self-sustaining network of  angry negative affect in depressed families. Moreover, parents' angry and  adolescents' dysphoric affect follow each other more often in depressed  families. Taken together, these patterns reveal a particular family dynamic that  may contribute to vulnerability to, or maintenance of, adolescent depressive  disorders. Our findings underline the importance of studying affective family  interactions to understand adolescent depression.

(2)Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. (3)Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University,  Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.	Although shyness is a ubiquitous phenomenon with early developmental origins,  little research has examined the influence of prenatal exposures on the  developmental trajectory of shyness. Here, we examined trajectories of shyness  from childhood to adulthood in three groups (N = 254), with varying degrees of  prenatal adversity as indicated by the number of stressful exposures: extremely  low birth weight (ELBW; <1000 g) survivors prenatally exposed to exogenous  corticosteroids (ELBW+S, n = 56); ELBW survivors not prenatally exposed to  exogenous corticosteroids (ELBW+NS, n = 56); and normal birth weight (NBW, n =  142) controls. Multilevel modeling revealed that the ELBW+S individuals  exhibited the highest levels of childhood shyness, which remained stable into  adulthood. The ELBW+NS and NBW controls had comparably low levels of childhood  shyness; however, the ELBW+NS individuals experienced patterns of increasing  shyness, while NBW controls displayed decreases in shyness into adulthood. We  speculate that individuals exposed to multiple prenatal stressors (i.e., ELBW+S)  may be developmentally programmed to be more sensitive to detecting social  threat, with one manifestation being early developing, stable shyness, while  increasing shyness among ELBW+NS individuals may reflect a later developing  shyness influenced by postnatal context. We discuss the implications of these  findings for understanding the developmental origins and developmental course of  human shyness from childhood through adulthood.

Building on prior work regarding the potential for peer contagion or deviance  training in group delivered interventions (Dishion & Dodge, 2005, 2006; Dodge,  Dishion, & Lansford, 2006), we leveraged data from a randomized trial, testing  the integration of two preventive interventions (Promoting Alternative THinking  Strategies and PAX Good Behavior Game), to explore the extent to which classroom  contextual factors served as either a barrier to or a motivator for teachers to  implement the evidence-based PAX Good Behavior Game with high frequency or  dosage. We included students' baseline levels of behavior, measured with regard  to both positive (i.e., engagement and social emotional skills) and negative  (i.e., hyperactive and aggressive-disruptive) behaviors. Data were collected  from 204 teachers in 18 urban elementary schools. A series of multilevel  structural equation models were fit to the data. The analyses indicated that  classrooms with higher classroom levels of aggressive behavior, on average, at  baseline had teachers with lower implementation dosage (i.e., played fewer  games) across the school year. In addition, teachers who reported higher  baseline levels of emotional exhaustion, regardless of student behavior, also  reported lower implementation dosage. Taken together, the results indicated that  negative, but not positive, contextual factors at baseline were related to lower  implementation dosage; this, in turn, suggests that negative contextual factors  may serve as a barrier, rather than a motivator, of teachers' implementation  dosage of classroom-based preventive interventions.

Maternal depression in the intergenerational transmission of childhood  maltreatment and its sequelae: Testing postpartum effects in a longitudinal  birth cohort.	Choi KW(1), Houts R(1), Arseneault L(2), Pariante C(2), Sikkema KJ(1), Moffitt  TE(1).	Author information: (1)Duke University. (2)King's College London.	Mothers who have experienced childhood maltreatment are more likely to have  children also exposed to maltreatment, a phenomenon known as intergenerational  transmission. Factors in the perinatal period may contribute uniquely to this  transmission, but timing effects have not been ascertained. Using structural  equation modeling with 1,016 mothers and their 2,032 children in the  Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study, we tested the mediating role of  postpartum depression between maternal childhood maltreatment and a cascade of  negative child outcomes, specifically child exposure to maltreatment,  internalizing symptoms, and externalizing symptoms: (a) adjusting for later  maternal depression, (b) comparing across sex differences, and (c) examining the  relative role of maltreatment subtypes. Mothers who had been maltreated as  children, especially those who had experienced emotional or sexual abuse, were  at increased risk for postpartum depression. In turn, postpartum depression  predicted children's exposure to maltreatment, followed by emotional and  behavioral problems. Indirect effects from maternal childhood maltreatment to  child outcomes were robust across child sex and supported significant mediation  through postpartum depression; however, this appeared to be carried by mothers'  depression beyond the postpartum period. Identifying and treating postpartum  depression, and preventing its recurrence, may help interrupt the  intergenerational transmission of maltreatment and its sequelae.

Intergenerational associations in physical maltreatment: Examination of  mediation by delinquency and substance use, and moderated mediation by anger.	Capaldi DM(1), Tiberio SS(1), Pears KC(1), Kerr DCR(1), Owen LD(1).	Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center.	Findings as to whether individuals' experiences of physical maltreatment from  their parents in childhood predict their own perpetration of physical  maltreatment toward their children in adulthood are mixed. Whether the  maltreatment experienced is severe versus moderate or mild may relate to the  strength of intergenerational associations. Furthermore, understanding of the  roles of possible mediators (intervening mechanisms linking these behaviors) and  moderators of the intervening mechanisms (factors associated with stronger or  weaker mediated associations) is still relatively limited. These issues were  examined in the present study. Mediating mechanisms based on a social learning  model included antisocial behavior as assessed by criminal behaviors and  substance use (alcohol and drug use), and the extent to which parental angry  temperament moderated any indirect effects of antisocial behavior was also  examined. To address these issues, data were used from Generations 2 and 3 of a  prospective three-generational study, which is an extension of the Oregon Youth  Study. Findings indicated modest intergenerational associations for severe  physical maltreatment. There was a significant association of maltreatment  history, particularly severe maltreatment with mothers' and fathers'  delinquency. However, neither delinquency nor substance use showed significant  mediational effects, and parental anger as a moderator of mediation did not  reach significance.

We aim to determine the correlation between parental rearing, personality  traits, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in different quantiles. In  particular, we created an intermediary effect model in which parental rearing  affects OCD through personality traits. All predictors were measured at the time  of the survey, comprising parental rearing (paternal rearing and maternal  rearing), demographics (grade and gender), and personality traits (neuroticism,  extroversion, and psychoticism). These results suggest that (a) paternal  emotional warmth was negatively correlated with OCD at the 0.40-0.80 quantile,  while maternal emotional warmth was positively correlated with the OCD at the  0.45-0.69 quantile. (b) The correlation between negative parental rearing and  OCD ranged from the 0.67 to 0.95 quantile for paternal punishment, 0.14-0.82  quantile for paternal overprotection, 0.05-0.36 and >0.50 quantile for maternal  over-intervention and overprotection, and 0.08-0.88 quantile for maternal  rejection. (c) Extroversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism were not only  associated with OCD in a particular quantile but also mediated between parental  rearing (namely parental emotional warmth, paternal punishment, paternal  overprotection, maternal rejection, maternal over-intervention, and  overprotection) and OCD. These findings provide targets for early interventions  of OCD to improve the form of family education and personality traits and  warrant validation.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457942000108X PMID: 33432895

Birth weight interacts with a functional variant of the oxytocin receptor gene  (OXTR) to predict executive functioning in children.	Wade M(1), Prime H(1), Hoffmann TJ(2), Schmidt LA(3), O'Connor TG(4), Jenkins  JM(1).	Author information: (1)University of Toronto. (2)University of California at San Francisco. (3)McMaster University. (4)University of Rochester.	Genetic variation in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) is associated with  several psychiatric conditions characterized by deficits in executive  functioning (EF). A specific OXTR variant, rs2254298, has previously been  associated with brain functioning in regions implicated in EF. Moreover, birth  weight variation across the entire range is associated with individual  differences in cortical structure and function that underlie EF. This is the  first study to examine the main and interactive effect between rs2254298 and  birth weight on EF in children. The sample consisted of 310 children from an  ongoing longitudinal study. EF was measured at age 4.5 using observational tasks  indexing working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control. A  family-based design that controlled for population admixture, stratification,  and nongenomic confounds was employed. A significant genetic association between  rs2254298 and EF was observed, with more copies of the major allele (G)  associated with higher EF. There was also a significant interaction between  rs2254298 and birth weight, such that more copies of the major allele in  combination with higher birth weight predicted better EF. Findings suggest that  OXTR may be associated with discrete neurocognitive abilities in childhood, and  these effects may be modulated by intrauterine conditions related to fetal  growth and development.

Many studies demonstrate that marriage protects against risky alcohol use and  moderates genetic influences on alcohol outcomes; however, previous work has not  considered these effects from a developmental perspective or in high-risk  individuals. These represent important gaps, as it cannot be assumed that  marriage has uniform effects across development or in high-risk samples. We took  a longitudinal developmental approach to examine whether marital status was  associated with heavy episodic drinking (HED), and whether marital status  moderated polygenic influences on HED. Our sample included 937 individuals  (53.25% female) from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism who  reported their HED and marital status biennially between the ages of 21 and 25.  Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were derived from a genome-wide association study of  alcohol consumption. Marital status was not associated with HED; however, we  observed pathogenic gene-by-environment effects that changed across young  adulthood. Among those who married young (age 21), individuals with higher PRS  reported more HED; however, these effects decayed over time. The same pattern  was found in supplementary analyses using parental history of alcohol use  disorder as the index of genetic liability. Our findings indicate that early  marriage may exacerbate risk for those with higher polygenic load.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000371 PMCID: PMC7775899 PMID: 32611468

Sheridan MA(1), Peverill M(2), Finn AS(3), McLaughlin KA(2).	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina,Chapel Hill. (2)University of Toronto. (3)University of Washington.	Childhood adversity is associated with increased risk for psychopathology.  Neurodevelopmental pathways underlying this risk remain poorly understood. A  recent conceptual model posits that childhood adversity can be deconstructed  into at least two underlying dimensions, deprivation and threat, that are  associated with distinct neurocognitive consequences. This model argues that  deprivation (i.e., a lack of cognitive stimulation and learning opportunities)  is associated with poor executive function (EF), whereas threat is not. We  examine this hypothesis in two studies measuring EF at multiple levels:  performance on EF tasks, neural recruitment during EF, and problems with EF in  daily life. In Study 1, deprivation (low parental education and child neglect)  was associated with greater parent-reported problems with EF in adolescents (N =  169; 13-17 years) after adjustment for levels of threat (community violence and  abuse), which were unrelated to EF. In Study 2, low parental education was  associated with poor working memory (WM) performance and inefficient neural  recruitment in the parietal and prefrontal cortex during high WM load among  adolescents (N = 51, 13-20 years) after adjusting for abuse, which was unrelated  to WM task performance and neural recruitment during WM. These findings  constitute strong preliminary evidence for a novel model of the  neurodevelopmental consequences of childhood adversity.

While many studies focus on the association between early life adversity and the  later risk for psychopathology, few simultaneously explore diverse forms of  environmental adversity. Moreover, those studies that examined the cumulative  impact of early life adversity focus uniquely on postnatal influences. The  objective of this study was to focus on the fetal period of development to  construct and validate a cumulative prenatal adversity score in relation to a  wide range of neurodevelopmental outcomes. We also examined the interaction of  this adversity score with a biologically informed genetic score based on the  serotonin transporter gene. Prenatal adversities were computed in two community  birth cohorts using information on health during pregnancy, birth weight,  gestational age, income, domestic violence/sexual abuse, marital strain, as well  as maternal smoking, anxiety, and depression. A genetic score based on genes  coexpressed with the serotonin transporter in the amygdala, hippocampus, and  prefrontal cortex during prenatal life was constructed with an emphasis on  functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms, that is, expression  quantitative trait loci. Prenatal adversities predicted a wide range of  developmental and behavioral alterations in children as young as 2 years of age  in both cohorts. There were interactions between the genetic score and  adversities for several domains of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), with  pervasive developmental problems remaining significant adjustment for multiple  comparisons. Scores combining different prenatal adverse exposures predict  childhood behavior and interact with the genetic background to influence the  risk for psychopathology.

Environmental adversity increases child susceptibility to disrupted  developmental outcomes, but the mechanisms by which adversity can shape  development remain unclear. A translational cross-species approach was used to  examine stress-mediated pathways by which poverty-related adversity can  influence infant social development. Findings from a longitudinal sample of  low-income mother-infant dyads indicated that infant cortisol (CORT) on its own  did not mediate relations between early-life scarcity-adversity exposure and  later infant behavior in a mother-child interaction task. However, maternal CORT  through infant CORT served as a mediating pathway, even when controlling for  parenting behavior. Findings using a rodent "scarcity-adversity" model indicated  that pharmacologically blocking pup corticosterone (CORT, rodent equivalent to  cortisol) in the presence of a stressed mother causally prevented social  transmission of scarcity-adversity effects on pup social behavior. Furthermore,  pharmacologically increasing pup CORT without the mother present was not  sufficient to disrupt pup social behavior. Integration of our cross-species  results suggests that elevated infant CORT may be necessary, but without  elevated caregiver CORT, may not be sufficient in mediating the effects of  environmental adversity on development. These findings underscore the importance  of considering infant stress physiology in relation to the broader social  context, including caregiver stress physiology, in research and interventional  efforts.

Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) sequencing and developmental delay: Preliminary  evidence for a SNP in the 3' UTR region of the POMC gene-Possible relevance for  biological risk and self-injurious behavior.	Damerow JA(1), Tervo RC(2), Ehrhardt M(1), Panoskaltsis-Mortari A(1), Symons  FJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota. (2)Mayo Clinic.	The proopiomelanocortin (POMC) molecule has been implicated in models of  self-injurious behavior (SIB) in neurodevelopmental disorders, but it has never  been specifically sequenced in search of base specific polymorphisms. The  empirical focus of this preliminary study was to sequence the POMC gene in 11  children (mean age = 41.8 months, range = 12-60 months; 73% male) with clinical  concerns regarding global developmental delay, 5 with reported self-injury.  Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples, and the POMC gene was amplified by  specific oligonucleotide primers via polymerase chain reaction. The amplified  gene products were sequenced by the University of Minnesota Genomic Center, and  the results were analyzed using Sequencher software. A single nucleotide  polymorphism (SNP), 1130 C&gt;T, was found in the 3' untranslated region (UTR)  of two samples (one of whom had SIB). The program TargetScanHuman was used to  predict the function of this mutation. Variant c.1130 C&lt;T was predicted to be  located in the target site of two microRNAs (miRNAs; hsa-mir-3715 and  hsa-mir-1909), and the variant allele T may result in an increased minimum free  energy for the two miRNAs. Further work with much larger samples is needed to  continue the investigation of POMC's possible function as a risk factor for the  development of SIB in children with developmental delay/disability. The findings  presented in this study show that the SNP found in the 3' UTR could alter the  binding of miRNAs to POMC 3'UTR, thus, increasing POMC expression and affecting  several biological systems with high relevance to the biology of self-injury.  There was a significant difference in β-endorphin levels between SIB (M = 169.25  pg/mL) and no SIB (M = 273.5 pg/mL, SD = 15.2) cases (p &lt; .01). Intervention  implications are tied to prior observations of individual differences among SIB  responders and nonresponders to treatment with the opioid antagonist naltrexone.  Stratifying individuals with SIB by POMC mutation status may provide a potential  tailoring-like variable to guide the selection of who is more (or less) likely  to respond to opiate antagonist treatment.

An experimental test of the fetal programming hypothesis: Can we reduce child  ontogenetic vulnerability to psychopathology by decreasing maternal depression?	Davis EP(1), Hankin BL(2), Swales DA(1), Hoffman MC(3).	Author information: (1)University of Denver. (2)University of Illinois. (3)University of Colorado School of Medicine.	Maternal depression is one of the most common prenatal complications, and  prenatal maternal depression predicts many child psychopathologies. Here, we  apply the fetal programming hypothesis as an organizational framework to address  the possibility that fetal exposure to maternal depressive symptoms during  pregnancy affects fetal development of vulnerabilities and risk mechanisms,  which enhance risk for subsequent psychopathology. We consider four candidate  pathways through which maternal prenatal depression may affect the propensity of  offspring to develop later psychopathology across the life span: brain  development, physiological stress regulation  (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis), negative emotionality, and  cognitive (effortful) control. The majority of past research has been  correlational, so potential causal conclusions have been limited. We describe an  ongoing experimental test of the fetal programming influence of prenatal  maternal depressive symptoms using a randomized controlled trial design. In this  randomized controlled trial, interpersonal psychotherapy is compared to enhanced  usual care among distressed pregnant women to evaluate whether reducing prenatal  maternal depressive symptoms has a salutary impact on child ontogenetic  vulnerabilities and thereby reduces offspring's risk for emergence of later  psychopathology.

Prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) has been associated with postnatal behavioral  alterations that may be partly explained by interactions between the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG)  axes. Yet it remains unclear whether PNMS leads to enduring HPA-HPG alterations  in the offspring, and whether HPA-HPG interactions can impact behavior during  development, in particular levels of aggression in childhood. Here we  investigated the relationship between a marker for HPG axis function (baseline  testosterone) and a marker for HPA axis response (cortisol area under the curve)  in 11½-year-olds whose mothers were exposed to the 1998 Quebec ice storm during  pregnancy (n = 59 children; 31 boys, 28 girls). We examined (a) whether the  degree of objective or subjective PNMS regulates the testosterone-cortisol  relationship at age 11½, and (b) whether this testosterone-cortisol relationship  is associated with differences in aggressive behavior. We found that, at lower  levels of subjective PNMS, baseline testosterone and cortisol reactivity were  positively correlated; in contrast, there was no relationship between these  hormones at higher levels of subjective PNMS. Cortisol response moderated the  relationship between testosterone and aggression. These results support the  notion PNMS may explain variance in fetal HPA-HPG interactions, and that these  interactions may be associated with aggressive behavior in late childhood.

Developmental relations between amygdala volume and anxiety traits: Effects of  informant, sex, and age.	Warnell KR(1), Pecukonis M(2), Redcay E(2).	Author information: (1)Texas State University. (2)University of Maryland.	Although substantial human and animal evidence suggests a role for the amygdala  in anxiety, literature linking amygdala volume to anxiety symptomatology is  inconclusive, with studies finding positive, negative, and null results.  Clarifying this brain-behavior relation in middle to late childhood is  especially important, as this is a time both of amygdala structural maturation  and the emergence of many anxiety disorders. The goal of the current study was  to clarify inconsistent findings in previous literature by identifying factors  moderating the relation between amygdala volume and anxiety traits in a large  sample of typically developing children aged 6-13 years (N = 72). In particular,  we investigated the moderating effects of informant (parent vs. child), age, and  sex. We found that children's reports (i.e., self-reports) were related to  amygdala volume; children who reported higher anxiety levels had smaller  amygdalae. This negative relation between amygdala volume and anxiety weakened  with age. There was also an independent effect of sex, such that relations were  stronger in males than in females. These results indicate the importance of  considering sample and informant characteristics when charting the  neurobiological mechanisms underlying developmental anxiety.

Examining interactions between genetic risk for alcohol problems, peer deviance,  and interpersonal traumatic events on trajectories of alcohol use disorder  symptoms among African American college students.	Su J(1), Kuo SI(1), Meyers JL(2), Guy MC(1), Dick DM(1).	Author information: (1)Virginia Commonwealth University. (2)State University of New York Downstate Medical Center.	Numerous studies have demonstrated that genetic and environmental factors  interact to influence alcohol problems. Yet prior research has primarily focused  on samples of European descent and little is known about gene-environment  interactions in relation to alcohol problems in non-European populations. In  this study, we examined whether and how genetic risk for alcohol problems and  peer deviance and interpersonal traumatic events independently and interactively  influence trajectories of alcohol use disorder symptoms in a sample of African  American students across the college years (N = 1,119; Mage = 18.44 years). Data  were drawn from the Spit for Science study where participants completed multiple  online surveys throughout college and provided a saliva sample for genotyping.  Multilevel growth curve analyses indicated that alcohol dependence genome-wide  polygenic risk scores did not predict trajectory of alcohol use disorder  symptoms, while family history of alcohol problems was associated with alcohol  use disorder symptoms at the start of college but not with the rate of change in  symptoms over time. Peer deviance and interpersonal traumatic events were  associated with more alcohol use disorder symptoms across college years. Neither  alcohol dependence genome-wide polygenic risk scores nor family history of  alcohol problems moderated the effects of these environmental risk factors on  alcohol use disorder symptoms. Our findings indicated that peer deviance and  experience of interpersonal traumatic events are salient risk factors that  elevate risk for alcohol problems among African American college students.  Family history of alcohol problems could be a useful indicator of genetic risk  for alcohol problems. Gene identification efforts with much larger samples of  African descent are needed to better characterize genetic risk for alcohol use  disorders, in order to better understand gene-environment interaction processes  in this understudied population.

Three phases of Gene × Environment interaction research: Theoretical assumptions  underlying gene selection.	Zhang X(1), Belsky J(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Human Ecology, University of California, Davis, CA, USA.	Some Gene × Environment interaction (G×E) research has focused upon single  candidate genes, whereas other related work has targeted multiple genes (e.g.,  polygenic scores). Each approach has informed efforts to identify individuals  who are either especially vulnerable to the negative effects of contextual  adversity (diathesis stress) or especially susceptible to both positive and  negative contextual conditions (differential susceptibility). A critical step in  all such molecular G×E research is the selection of genetic variants thought to  moderate environmental influences, a subject that has not received a great deal  of attention in critiques of G×E research (beyond the observation of small  effects of individual genes). Here we conceptually distinguish three phases of  G×E work based on the selection of genes presumed to moderate environmental  effects and the theoretical basis of such decisions: (a) single candidate genes,  (b) composited (multiple) candidate genes, and (c) GWAS-derived polygenic  scores. This illustrative, not exhaustive, review makes it clear that implicit  or explicit theoretical assumptions inform gene selection in ways that have not  been clearly articulated or fully appreciated.

Author information: (1)Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Kennedy Tower,  Morningside Terrace, Edinburgh, UK. (2)Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, South  Yorkshire, UK.	Early neglect or maltreatment has been associated with changes in children's  processing of emotional facial expressions, including a hypersensitivity to the  emotion of anger. This may facilitate the avoidance of danger in a maltreating  environment. However, few studies have examined whether experiences of early  life stress (ELS) are associated with atypical avoidance responses towards  emotional facial expressions, or whether the effects of ELS can be observed in  adult participants. The present study therefore examined the effects of ELS on  adults' approach-avoidance tendencies towards angry, happy, and neutral facial  expressions. Surprisingly, higher levels of ELS were associated with reduced  avoidance of angry facial expressions among individuals with no evidence of  mental illness. In contrast, there was no evidence of a relationship between ELS  and avoidance of angry facial expressions among individuals with experience of  mental illness. These novel findings suggest that ELS-related changes in social  cognition can be observed years after the ELS itself occurred.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941900110X PMID: 31405395 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Clinical & Biological Psychology, Institute of Psychology and  Education, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.

DNA methylation of the elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 2  (ELOVL2) was suggested as a biomarker of biological aging, while childhood  maltreatment (CM) has been associated with accelerated biological aging. We  investigated the association of age and CM experiences with ELOVL2 methylation  in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Furthermore, we investigated  ELOVL2 methylation in the umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (UBMC) of  newborns of mothers with and without CM. PBMC and UBMC were isolated from 113  mother-newborn dyads and genomic DNA was extracted. Mothers with and without CM  experiences were recruited directly postpartum. Mass array spectrometry and  pyrosequencing were used for methylation analyses of ELOVL2 intron 1, and exon 1  and 5' end, respectively. ELOVL2 5' end and intron 1 methylation increased with  higher age but were not associated with CM experiences. On the contrary, overall  ELOVL2 exon 1 methylation increased with higher CM, but these changes were  minimal and did not increase with age. Maternal CM experiences and neonatal  methylation of ELOVL2 intron 1 or exon 1 were not significantly correlated. Our  study suggests region-specific effects of chronological age and experienced CM  on ELOVL2 methylation and shows that the epigenetic biomarker for age within the  ELOVL2 gene does not show accelerated biological aging years after CM exposure.

Sleep disturbance is a symptom of and a well-known risk factor for depression.  Further, atypical functioning of the HPA axis has been linked to the  pathogenesis of depression. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of  adolescent HPA axis functioning in the link between adolescent sleep problems  and later depressive symptoms. Methods: A sample of 157 17-18 year old  adolescents (61.8% female) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory  (PSQI) and provided salivary cortisol samples throughout the day for three  consecutive days. Two years later, adolescents reported their depressive  symptoms via the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).  Results: Individuals (age 17-18) with greater sleep disturbance reported greater  depressive symptoms two years later (age 19-20). This association occurred  through the indirect effect of sleep disturbance on the cortisol awakening  response (CAR) (indirect effect = 0.14, 95%CI [.02 -.39]). Conclusions: One  pathway through which sleep problems may lead to depressive symptoms is by  up-regulating components of the body's physiological stress response system that  can be measured through the cortisol awakening response. Behavioral  interventions that target sleep disturbance in adolescents may mitigate this  neurobiological pathway to depression during this high-risk developmental phase.

Maternal trauma is a complex risk factor that has been linked to adverse child  outcomes, yet the mechanisms underlying this association are not well  understood. This study, which included adoptive and biological families,  examined the heritable and environmental mechanisms by which maternal trauma and  associated depressive symptoms are linked to child internalizing and  externalizing behaviors. Path analyses were used to analyze data from 541  adoptive mother-adopted child (AM-AC) dyads and 126 biological mother-biological  child (BM-BC) dyads; the two family types were linked through the same  biological mother. Rearing mother's trauma was associated with child  internalizing and externalizing behaviors in AM-AC and BM-BC dyads, and this  association was mediated by rearing mothers' depressive symptoms, with the  exception of biological child externalizing behavior, for which biological  mother trauma had a direct influence only. Significant associations between  maternal trauma and child behavior in dyads that share only environment (i.e.,  AM-AC dyads) suggest an environmental mechanism of influence for maternal  trauma. Significant associations were also observed between maternal depressive  symptoms and child internalizing and externalizing behavior in dyads that were  only genetically related, with no shared environment (i.e., BM-AC dyads),  suggesting a heritable pathway of influence via maternal depressive symptoms.

Being born small for gestational age (SGA) is considered a developmental  vulnerability. Alternatively, SGA may be viewed as a marker for individual  susceptibility to environmental experiences. The aim was to test if individuals  born SGA are more susceptible to both negative and positive environmental  experiences assessed by sensitive parenting in childhood compared with those  born appropriate for gestational age (AGA). The target outcome was wealth in  young adulthood. A total of 438 participants (SGA, n = 109; AGA, n = 329) were  studied as part of the prospective Bavarian Longitudinal Study of neonatal  at-risk children. Maternal sensitivity was observed during a standardized  mother-child interaction task, and IQ was assessed with the Kaufman Assessment  Battery for Children at age 6 years. At age 26, participants' wealth was  assessed with a comprehensive composite score. Individuals born SGA were found  to be more susceptible to the effects of sensitive parenting after controlling  for gestational age and IQ at age 6 years. When maternal sensitivity was lower  than average, SGA adults did worse than AGA adults, but when exposed to  above-average maternal sensitivity in childhood, they obtained significantly  higher wealth than their AGA peers by 26 years of age.

Experiencing poverty increases vulnerability for dysregulated  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning and compromises long-term  health. Positive parenting buffers children from HPA axis reactivity, yet this  has primarily been documented among families not experiencing poverty. We tested  the theorized power of positive parenting in 124 parent-child dyads recruited  from Early Head Start (Mage = 25.21 months) by examining child cortisol  trajectories using five samples collected across a standardized stress paradigm.  Piecewise latent growth models revealed that positive parenting buffered  children's stress responses when controlling for time of day, last stress task  completed, and demographics. Positive parenting also interacted with income such  that positive parenting was especially protective for cortisol reactivity in  families experiencing greater poverty. Findings suggest that positive parenting  behaviors are important for protecting children in families experiencing low  income from heightened or prolonged physiologic stress reactivity to an acute  stressor.

Gonadal and adrenal hormones interact with pubertal maturation to predict  depressive symptoms in a group of high-school females.

(2)Department of Psychology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.	Adolescent females are at elevated risk for the development of depression. In  this study, we addressed two questions: Are pubertal hormones associated with  adolescent mental health? Might this association depend on pubertal development?  We tested the hypothesis that estradiol, which has been associated with  adolescent social sensitivity, might interact with pubertal stage to predict  depression risk at three time points in ninth and tenth grade. Hormones and  pubertal development were measured ninth-grade females. Linear regression  analyses were used to predict fall ninth-grade (N = 79), spring ninth-grade (N =  76), and spring tenth-grade (N = 67) Children's Depression Inventory (CDI)  scores. The hypothesized model was not statistically significant, but  exploratory analyses revealed that two- and three-way interactions incorporating  estradiol, puberty (stage and perceived onset), and cortisol predicted current  and future CDI scores. Our exploratory model did not predict changes in CDI but  did account for future (spring of ninth grade) CDI scores. Specifically,  estradiol was positively correlated with fall and spring ninth-grade depressive  symptoms in participants with high cortisol who also reported earlier stages and  later perceived onset of pubertal development. These findings suggest that  hormones associated with sensitivity to the social environment deserve  consideration in models of adolescent depression risk.

This study originated in collaboration with Thomas Dishion because of concerns  that a group format for aggressive children might dampen the effects of  cognitive-behavioral intervention. Three hundred sixty aggressive preadolescent  children were screened through teacher and parent ratings. Schools were  randomized to receive either an individual or a group format of the child  component of the same evidence-based program. The results indicate that there is  variability in how group-based cognitive-behavioral intervention can affect  aggressive children through a long 4-year follow-up after the end of the  intervention. Aggressive children who have higher skin conductance reactivity  (potentially an indicator of poorer emotion regulation) and who have a variant  of the oxytocin receptor gene that may be associated with being hyperinvolved in  social bonding have better outcomes in their teacher-rated externalizing  behavior outcomes over time if they were seen individually rather than in  groups. Analyses also indicated that higher levels of the group leaders'  clinical skills predicted reduced externalizing behavior problems. Implications  for group versus individual format of cognitive-behavioral interventions for  aggressive children, and for intensive training for group therapists, informed  by these results, are discussed.

The Atypical Maternal Behavior Instrument for Assessment and Classification  (AMBIANCE; Bronfman, Madigan, &amp; Lyons-Ruth, 2009-2014; Bronfman, Parsons,  &amp; Lyons-Ruth, 1992-2004) is a widely used and well-validated measure for  assessing disrupted forms of caregiver responsiveness within parent-child  interactions. However, it requires evaluating approximately 150 behavioral items  from videotape and extensive training to code, thus making its use impractical  in most clinical contexts. Accordingly, the primary aim of the current study was  to identify a reduced set of behavioral indicators most central to the AMBIANCE  coding system using latent-trait item response theory (IRT) models. Observed  mother-infant interaction data previously coded with the AMBIANCE was pooled  from laboratories in both North America and Europe (N = 343). Using 2-parameter  logistic IRT models, a reduced set of 45 AMBIANCE items was identified.  Preliminary convergent and discriminant validity was evaluated in relation to  classifications of maternal disrupted communication assigned using the full set  of AMBIANCE indicators, to infant attachment disorganization, and to maternal  sensitivity. The results supported the construct validity of the refined item  set, opening the way for development of a brief screening measure for disrupted  maternal communication. IRT models in clinical scale refinement and their  potential for bridging clinical and research objectives in developmental  psychopathology are discussed.

Emotional insecurity as a mediator of the moderating role of dopamine genes in  the association between interparental conflict and youth externalizing problems.

(4)Department of Psychology,University of Notre Dame,Notre Dame, IN,USA.	This study tested whether the association between interparental conflict and  adolescent externalizing symptoms was moderated by a polygenic composite  indexing low dopamine activity (i.e., 7-repeat allele of DRD4; Val alleles of  COMT; 10-repeat variants of DAT1) in a sample of seventh-grade adolescents (Mean  age = 13.0 years) and their parents. Using a longitudinal, autoregressive  design, observational assessments of interparental conflict at Wave 1 predicted  increases in a multi-informant measurement of youth externalizing symptoms 2  years later at Wave 3 only for children who were high on the hypodopaminergic  composite. Moderation was expressed in a "for better" or "for worse" form  hypothesized by differential susceptibility theory. Thus, children high on the  dopaminergic composite experienced more externalizing problems than their peers  when faced with more destructive conflicts but also fewer externalizing problems  when exposed to more constructive interparental conflicts. Mediated moderation  findings indicated that adolescent reports of their emotional insecurity in the  interparental relationship partially explained the greater genetic  susceptibility experienced by these children. More specifically, the dopamine  composite moderated the association between Wave 1 interparental conflict and  emotional insecurity 1 year later at Wave 2 in the same "for better" or "for  worse" pattern as externalizing symptoms. Adolescent insecurity at Wave 2, in  turn, predicted their greater externalizing symptoms 1 year later at Wave 3.  Post hoc analyses further revealed that the 7-repeat allele of the dopamine  receptor D4 (DRD4) gene was the primary source of plasticity in the polygenic  composite. Results are discussed as to how they advance process-oriented Gene x  Environment models of emotion regulation.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419000634 PMID: 31057130 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

However, significant methodological concerns have been  raised regarding evidence supporting this assertion, with some arguing that the  association weakens in samples with higher methodological rigor. In the current  study, the intergenerational transmission of maltreatment hypothesis is examined  in 142 studies (149 samples; 227,918 dyads) that underwent a methodological  quality review, as well as data extraction on a number of potential moderator  variables. Results reveal a modest association of intergenerational maltreatment  (k = 80; d = 0.45, 95% confidence interval; CI [0.37, 0.54]). Support for the  intergenerational transmission of specific maltreatment types was also observed  (neglect: k = 13, d = 0.24, 95% CI [0.11, 0.37]; physical abuse: k = 61, d =  0.41, 95% CI [0.33, 0.49]; emotional abuse: k = 18, d = 0.57, 95% CI [0.43,  0.71]; sexual abuse: k = 18, d = 0.39, 95% CI [0.24, 0.55]). Methodological  quality only emerged as a significant moderator of the intergenerational  transmission of physical abuse, with a weakening of effect sizes as  methodological rigor increased. Evidence from this meta-analysis confirms the  cycle of maltreatment hypothesis, although effect sizes were modest. Future  research should focus on deepening understanding of mechanisms of transmission,  as well as identifying protective factors that can effectively break the cycle  of maltreatment.

Boulton KA(1), Porter MA(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Centre for Atypical Neurodevelopment, Macquarie  University, Sydney, Australia.	There is evidence that individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) show an attention  bias toward positive social-perceptual (happy) faces. Research has not yet  considered whether this attention bias extends beyond social-perceptual stimuli  to perceptually neutral stimuli that are paired with positive (trustworthy)  biographical information. Fourteen participants with WS (mean age = 21 years, 1  month) learned to associate perceptually neutral faces with trustworthy  (positive), neutral, or untrustworthy (negative) biographical information,  before completing a dot-probe task where the same biographical faces were  presented. The performance of the WS group was compared to two typically  developing control groups, individually matched to the WS individuals on  chronological age and mental age, respectively. No between-group bias toward  untrustworthy characters was observed. The WS group displayed a selective  attention bias toward trustworthy characters compared to both control groups  (who did not show such a bias). Results support previous findings that indicate  WS individuals show a preference for positive social-perceptual stimuli (happy  faces) at the neurological, physiological, and attentional levels. The current  findings extend this work to include a "top-down" positive bias. The  implications of a positive bias that extends beyond social-perceptual stimuli  (or "bottom-up" processes) in this syndrome are discussed.

(5)Boston Children's Hospital.	We examined facial emotion recognition in 12-year-olds in a longitudinally  followed sample of children with and without exposure to early life psychosocial  deprivation (institutional care). Half of the institutionally reared children  were randomized into foster care homes during the first years of life. Facial  emotion recognition was examined in a behavioral task using morphed images. This  same task had been administered when children were 8 years old. Neutral facial  expressions were morphed with happy, sad, angry, and fearful emotional facial  expressions, and children were asked to identify the emotion of each face, which  varied in intensity. Consistent with our previous report, we show that some  areas of emotion processing, involving the recognition of happy and fearful  faces, are affected by early deprivation, whereas other areas, involving the  recognition of sad and angry faces, appear to be unaffected. We also show that  early intervention can have a lasting positive impact, normalizing developmental  trajectories of processing negative emotions (fear) into the late  childhood/preadolescent period.

Nurturant-involved parenting and adolescent substance use: Examining an  internalizing pathway through adolescent social anxiety symptoms and substance  refusal efficacy.	Weymouth BB(1), Fosco GM(1), Feinberg ME(1).	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University.	Research has clearly established the important role of parents in preventing  substance use among early adolescents. Much of this work has focused on deviance  (e.g., antisocial behavior, delinquency, and oppositional behavior) as a central  pathway linking parenting behaviors and early adolescent substance use. This  study proposed an alternative pathway; using a four-wave longitudinal design, we  examined whether nurturant-involved parenting (Fall sixth grade) was inversely  associated with adolescent drunkenness, marijuana use, and cigarette use (eighth  grade) through social anxiety symptoms (Spring sixth grade) and subsequent  decreases in substance refusal efficacy (seventh grade). Nurturant-involved  parenting is characterized by warmth, supportiveness, low hostility, and low  rejection. Analyses were conducted with a sample of 687 two-parent families.  Results indicated that adolescents who were in families where fathers exhibited  lower levels of nurturant-involved parenting experienced subsequent increases in  social anxiety symptoms and decreased efficacy to refuse substances, which in  turn was related to more frequent drunkenness, cigarette use, and marijuana use.  Indirect effects are discussed. Findings were not substantiated for mothers'  parenting. Adolescent gender did not moderate associations. The results  highlight an additional pathway through which parenting influences youth  substance use and links social anxiety symptoms to reduced substance refusal  efficacy.

Externalizing behavior severity in youths with callous-unemotional traits  corresponds to patterns of amygdala activity and connectivity during judgments  of causing fear.

Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2018 May;30(2):717-718.	Callous-unemotional (CU) traits characterize a subgroup of youths with conduct  problems who exhibit low empathy, fearlessness, and elevated externalizing  behaviors. The current study examines the role of aberrant amygdala activity and  functional connectivity during a socioemotional judgment task in youths with CU  traits, and links these deficits to externalizing behaviors. Functional magnetic  resonance imaging was used to compare neural responses in 18 healthy youths and  30 youths with conduct problems and varying levels of CU traits as they  evaluated the acceptability of causing another person to experience each of  several emotions, including fear. Neuroimaging analyses examined blood  oxygenation level dependent responses and task-dependent functional  connectivity. High-CU youths exhibited left amygdala hypoactivation relative to  healthy controls and low-CU youths primarily during evaluations of causing  others fear. CU traits moderated the relationship between externalizing behavior  and both amygdala activity and patterns of functional connectivity. The present  data suggest that CU youths' aberrant amygdala activity and connectivity affect  how they make judgments about the acceptability of causing others emotional  distress, and that these aberrations represent risk factors for externalizing  behaviors like rule breaking and aggression. These findings suggest that  reducing externalizing behaviors in high-CU youths may require interventions  that influence affective sensitivity.

Allen JP(1), Loeb EL(1), Tan JS(1), Narr RK(1), Uchino BN(2).	Author information: (1)University of Virginia. (2)University of Utah.	Struggles managing conflict and hostility in adolescent social relationships  were examined as long-term predictors of immune-mediated inflammation in  adulthood that has been linked to long-term health outcomes. Circulating levels  of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a marker of immune system dysfunction when chronically  elevated, were assessed at age 28 in a community sample of 127 individuals  followed via multiple methods and reporters from ages 13 to 28. Adult serum IL-6  levels were predicted across periods as long as 15 years by adolescents'  inability to defuse peer aggression and poor peer-rated conflict resolution  skills, and by independently observed romantic partner hostility in late  adolescence. Adult relationship difficulties also predicted higher IL-6 levels  but did not mediate predictions from adolescent-era conflict struggles.  Predictions were also not mediated by adult trait hostility or aggressive  behavior, suggesting the unique role of struggles with conflict and hostility  from others during adolescence. The implications for understanding the import of  adolescent peer relationships for life span physical health outcomes are  considered.

The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene and child's sex  moderate the relationship between disaster-related prenatal maternal stress and  autism spectrum disorder traits: The QF2011 Queensland flood study.

Author information: (1)Douglas Institute Research Centre,Montreal, QC,Canada. (2)Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland,Brisbane, QLD,Australia.	The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism of the serotonin transporter has been shown to play a  role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Moreover, disaster-related prenatal  maternal stress (PNMS) has also been shown to be associated with ASD. However,  no study to date has examined whether these two factors, either individually or  in combination, are predictive of ASD traits in the same sample. We hypothesized  that children, particularly boys, with the LL genotype exposed to high levels of  disaster-related PNMS would exhibit higher levels of ASD traits compared to boys  with the LS or SS genotypes and girls regardless of genotype. Genotype and ASD  levels obtained using the Australian normed Autism Spectrum Rating Scales -  Short Form were available for 105 30-month-old children exposed to varying  levels of PNMS following the 2011 Queensland Flood. For boys, higher ASD traits  were associated with the 5-HTTLPR LL genotype in combination with either a  negative maternal appraisal of the flood, or high levels of maternal composite  subjective stress, PSTD-like or peritraumatic dissociation symptoms. For girls,  maternal peritraumatic dissociation levels in combination with the 5-HTTLPR LS  or SS genotype were associated with higher ASD traits. The present findings are  the first to demonstrate that children's genotype moderates effects of  disaster-related PNMS on ASD traits, with different pattern according to child  sex.

Externalizing behavior from early childhood to adolescence: Prediction from  inhibition, language, parenting, and attachment.	Roskam I(1).	Author information: (1)Université catholique de Louvain.	The aim of the current research was to disentangle four theoretically sound  models of externalizing behavior etiology (i.e., attachment, language,  inhibition, and parenting) by testing their relation with behavioral  trajectories from early childhood to adolescence. The aim was achieved through a  10-year prospective longitudinal study conducted over five waves with 111  referred children aged 3 to 5 years at the onset of the study. Clinical referral  was primarily based on externalizing behavior. A multimethod (questionnaires,  testing, and observations) approach was used to estimate the four predictors in  early childhood. In line with previous studies, the results show a significant  decrease of externalizing behavior from early childhood to adolescence. The  decline was negatively related to mothers' coercive parenting and positively  related to attachment security in early childhood, but not related to inhibition  and language. The study has implications for research into externalizing  behavior etiology recommending to gather hypotheses from various theoretically  sound models to put them into competition with one another. The study also has  implications for clinical practice by providing clear indications for prevention  and early intervention.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418000135 PMID: 29562952 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

(4)Northwestern University.	A quarter of the global population meets diagnostic criteria for metabolic  syndrome (MetS). MetS prevalence stratifies by socioeconomic status (SES), such  that low SES is associated with higher MetS risk starting in childhood. Despite  this trend, some low-SES children maintain good metabolic health across the life  span, but the factors responsible for their resilience are not well understood.  This study examined the role of threat vigilance as either a moderator or a  mediator of the effects of low early life SES on adult metabolic risk. Three  hundred twenty-five Canadians aged 15-55 participated (M = 36.4 years, SD =  10.7; 55.4% female). We coded parental occupational status between the ages of 0  and 5 to index early life SES. We used the International Diabetes Federation  case definition for MetS based on waist circumference, blood pressure,  triglyceride levels, HDL cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin measures.  Threat vigilance was assessed using the Weapons Identification Procedure, a  visual discrimination paradigm that captures implicit perceptions of threat.  Analyses supported the moderator hypothesis: low early life SES was associated  with MetS diagnosis exclusively among those with high levels of threat  vigilance. This suggests that low early life SES environments that heighten  vigilance to threat might be particularly detrimental for metabolic health.  Conversely, low threat vigilance may buffer against the metabolic risks  associated with socioeconomic disadvantage.

Author information: (1)University Hospital Erlangen. (2)Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg. (3)Helmholtz Zentrum München.	Epigenetic DNA modifications in genes related to the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are discussed as a mechanism  underlying the association between prenatal depression and altered child HPA  activity. In a longitudinal study, DNA methylation changes related to prenatal  depressive symptoms were investigated in 167 children aged 6 to 9 years. At six  candidate genes, 126 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides were considered without  correcting for multiple testing due to the exploratory nature of the study.  Further associations with the basal child HPA activity were examined. Children  exposed to prenatal depressive symptoms exhibited lower bedtime cortisol (p =  .003, ηp2 = 0.07) and a steeper diurnal slope (p = .023, ηp2 = 0.06). For total  cortisol release, prenatal exposure was related to lower cortisol release in  boys, and higher release in girls. Furthermore, prenatal depressive symptoms  were associated with altered methylation in the glucocorticoid receptor gene  (NR3C1), the mineralocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C2), and the serotonin receptor  gene (SLC6A4), with some sex-specific effects (p = .012-.040, ηp2 = 0.03-0.04).  In boys, prenatal depressive symptoms predicted bedtime cortisol mediated by  NR3C2 methylation, indirect effect = -0.07, 95% confidence interval [-0.16,  -0.02]. Results indicate relations of prenatal depressive symptoms to both child  basal HPA activity and DNA methylation, partially fitting a mediation model,  with exposed boys and girls being affected differently.

As a founder of the field of applied developmental psychology, Dr Edward Zigler  promoted public policy that translated scientific knowledge into real-world  programs to improve the outcomes of high-risk children and families. Many  researchers, practitioners, and public policy proponents have sought to carry on  his legacy through integration of empirical research, evidence-based prevention  and intervention, and advocacy to address a range of challenges facing families  with young children. To advance the field of child maltreatment, a  multidisciplinary team of investigators from the Universities of Rochester and  Minnesota partnered with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child  Health and Human Development to create the Translational Research that Adapts  New Science FOR Maltreatment Prevention Center (Transform). Building on  state-of-the-art research methodologies and clinical practices, Transform  leverages theoretically grounded research and evidence-based interventions to  optimize outcomes for individuals across the life span who have experienced, or  may be at risk for, maltreatment. Inspired by the work of Dr Zigler, Transform  is committed to bridging science and real-world practice. Therefore, in addition  to creating new science, Transform's Community Engagement Core provides  translational science to a broad audience of investigators, child-serving  professionals, and parental and governmental stakeholders. This article  describes Transform's purpose, theoretical framework, current activities, and  future directions.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420002138 PMID: 33517935

Early caregiving adversity is associated with increased risk for social  difficulties. The ventral striatum and associated corticostriatal circuitry,  which have demonstrated vulnerability to early exposures to adversity, are  implicated in many aspects of social behavior, including social play,  aggression, and valuation of social stimuli across development. Here, we used  resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the degree to  which early caregiving adversity was associated with altered coritocostriatal  resting connectivity in previously institutionalized youth (n = 41) relative to  youth who were raised with their biological families from birth (n = 47), and  the degree to which this connectivity was associated with parent-reported social  problems. Using a seed-based approach, we observed increased positive coupling  between the ventral striatum and anterior regions of medial prefrontal cortex  (mPFC) in previously institutionalized youth. Stronger ventral striatum-mPFC  coupling was associated with parent reports of social problems. A  moderated-mediation analysis showed that ventral striatal-mPFC connectivity  mediated group differences in social problems, and more so with increasing age.  These findings show that early institutional care is associated with differences  in resting-state connectivity between the ventral striatum and the mPFC, and  this connectivity seems to play an increasingly important role in social  behaviors as youth enter adolescence.

Individuals who have experienced high levels of childhood stress are at  increased risk for a wide range of behavioral problems that persist into  adulthood, yet the neurobiological and molecular mechanisms underlying these  associations remain poorly understood. Many of the difficulties observed in  stress-exposed children involve problems with learning and inhibitory control.  This experiment was designed to test individuals' ability to learn to inhibit  responding during a laboratory task. To do so, we measured stress exposure among  a community sample of school-aged children, and then followed these children for  a decade. Those from the highest and lowest quintiles of childhood stress  exposure were invited to return to our laboratory as young adults. At that time,  we reassessed their life stress exposure, acquired functional magnetic resonance  imaging data during an inhibitory control task, and assayed these individuals'  levels of methylation in the FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene. We found that  individuals who experienced high levels of stress in childhood showed less  differentiation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between error and correct  trials during inhibition. This effect was associated only with childhood stress  exposure and not by current levels of stress in adulthood. In addition, FKBP5  methylation mediated the association between early life stress and  inhibition-related prefrontal activity. These findings are discussed in terms of  using multiple levels of analyses to understand the ways in which adversity in  early development may affect adult behavioral adaptation.

Childhood adversity is thought to undermine youth socioemotional development via  altered neural function within regions that support emotion processing. These  effects are hypothesized to be developmentally specific, with adversity in early  childhood sculpting subcortical structures (e.g., amygdala) and adversity during  adolescence impacting later-developing structures (e.g., prefrontal cortex;  PFC). However, little work has tested these theories directly in humans. Using  prospectively collected longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child  Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) (N = 4,144) and neuroimaging data from a subsample of  families recruited in adolescence (N = 162), the current study investigated the  trajectory of harsh parenting across childhood (i.e., ages 3 to 9) and how  initial levels versus changes in harsh parenting across childhood were  associated with corticolimbic activation and connectivity during socioemotional  processing. Harsh parenting in early childhood (indexed by the intercept term  from a linear growth curve model) was associated with less amygdala, but not  PFC, reactivity to angry facial expressions. In contrast, change in harsh  parenting across childhood (indexed by the slope term) was associated with less  PFC, but not amygdala, activation to angry faces. Increases in, but not initial  levels of, harsh parenting were also associated with stronger positive  amygdala-PFC connectivity during angry face processing.

Supportive forensic interviews conducted in accordance with the National  Institute of Child Health and Human Development Revised Protocol (RP) help many  alleged victims describe abusive experiences. When children remain reluctant to  make allegations, the RP guides interviewers to (a) focus on rapport building  and nonsuggestive support in a first interview, and (b) plan a second interview  to allow continued rapport building before exploring for possible abuse. We  explored the dynamics of such two-session RP interviews. Of 204 children who  remained reluctant in an initial interview, we focused on 104 who made  allegations when re-interviewed a few days later. A structural equation model  revealed that interviewer support during the first session predicted children's  cooperation during the rapport-building phase of the second session, which, in  turn, predicted more spontaneous allegations, which were associated with the  interviewers' enhanced use of open-ended questions. Together, these factors  mediated the effects of support on children's free recall of forensically  important information. This highlighted the importance of emphasizing rapport  with reluctant children, confirming that some children may need more time to  build rapport even with supportive interviewers.

Adolescence effortful control as a mediator between family ecology and  problematic substance use in early adulthood: A 16-year prospective study.	Mun CJ(1), Dishion TJ(1), Tein JY(1), Otten R(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University REACH Institute.	This study examined the mediated effect of early adolescence familial context on  early adulthood problematic substance use through effortful control in late  adolescence. The sample consisted of a community sample of 311 adolescents and  their families comprising the control group within a randomized trial  intervention. Parental monitoring and parent-child relationship quality (P-C RQ)  were measured annually from ages 11 to 13. Effortful control was measured by  self-reports and parent and teacher reports at ages 16 to 17. Self-reports of  problematic tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use were measured at ages 18 to 19,  21 to 22, 23 to 24, and 26 to 27. Structural equation modeling was employed to  test hypothesized models. Only P-C RQ was found to be significantly associated  with adolescent effortful control. As expected, higher levels of adolescent  effortful control were associated with lower problematic substance use through  early adulthood, controlling for previous substance use levels. Mediation  analyses showed that effortful control significantly mediated the relationship  between P-C RQ and problematic substance use. Higher relationship quality  between youth and parents in early adolescence is associated with higher  effortful control, which in turn relates to a lower level of problematic  substance use in early adulthood.

Dynamic stress-related epigenetic regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene  promoter during early development: The role of child maltreatment.

Epigenetics processes may play a vital role in the biological embedding of early  environmental adversity and the development of psychopathology. Accumulating  evidence suggests that maltreatment is linked to methylation of the  glucocorticoid receptor gene, nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1  (NR3C1), which is a key regulator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis.  However, prior work has been exclusively cross-sectional, greatly constraining  our understanding of stress-related epigenetic processes over time. In the  current study, we examined the effect of maltreatment and other adversity on  change in NR3C1 methylation among at-risk preschoolers to begin to characterize  within-child epigenetic changes during this sensitive developmental period.  Participants were 260 preschoolers (3-5 years old, 53.8% female), including  51.5% with moderate to severe maltreatment in the past 6 months. Child  protection records, semistructured interviews, and parent reports were used to  assess child stress exposure. Methylation of exons 1D and 1F of NR3C1 via saliva  DNA were measured at two time points approximately 6 months apart. Results  indicate that maltreated children evidence higher baseline levels of NR3C1  methylation, significant decreases in methylation over time, and then at  follow-up, lower levels of methylation, relative to nonmaltreated preschoolers.  Findings from the current study highlight the complex nature of stress-related  epigenetic processes during early development.

Understanding the nature of associations between family instability,  unsupportive parenting, and children's externalizing symptoms.	Coe JL(1), Davies PT(1), Hentges RF(2), Sturge-Apple ML(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology, University of  Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA. (2)Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.	This study examined the mediating role of maternal unsupportive parenting in  explaining associations between family instability and children's externalizing  symptoms during the transition to formal schooling in early childhood.  Participants included 243 preschool children (M age = 4.60 years) and their  parents. Findings from cross-lagged autoregressive models conducted with  multimethod (survey and observations), multi-informant (parent, teacher, and  observer), longitudinal (three annual waves of data collection) data indicated  that experiences with heightened family instability predicted decreases in  supportive parenting, which in turn predicted increases in children's  externalizing symptoms. Analyses also revealed a bidirectional association  between parenting and family instability over time, such that higher levels of  instability predicted decreases in supportive parenting, which in turn predicted  increases in family instability.

We examined whether adolescents' loneliness and social withdrawal mediated the  association between maternal depressive symptoms and adolescent suicidality.  Secondary analyses on the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development data  were conducted (n = 1,623). Each mother completed the Centre for Epidemiologic  Studies Depression Scale (at child ages 5 months, 1.5, 3.5, 5, and 7 years).  Adolescent's social withdrawal (adolescent, father, and teacher reported at 10,  12, and 13 years) and loneliness (adolescent reported at 10, 12, and 13 years),  were assessed using items from the Social Behavior Questionnaire and the  Loneliness and Social Satisfaction Questionnaire, respectively. Adolescents  completed self-reports to assess suicidal thoughts and attempts at 13, 15, 17,  and 20 years. Children of mothers with higher levels of maternal depressive  symptoms had an increased risk for suicidality (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.28).  Loneliness explained 16% of the total effect of maternal depressive symptoms on  adolescent suicidality (indirect effect OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00-1.04). There was  no indirect effect of maternal depressive symptoms on adolescent suicidal  outcomes via social withdrawal (indirect effect OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99-1.02).  Interventions that target loneliness may be beneficial for decreasing the risk  for suicidality among adolescents of mothers with depressive symptoms.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001753 PMID: 33487191

The value added of attachment theory, research, and intervention for US child  care and early childhood education: Reflecting and carrying forward the legacy  of Edward Zigler.	Berlin LJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Maryland School of Social Work, Baltimore, MD, USA.	Edward Zigler pioneered and insisted upon the integration of science, practice,  and policy development to support vulnerable children and families, reduce  poverty, and improve US wellbeing, writ large. His far-reaching scholarship in  turn critically shaped developmental science and US policy in multiple areas.  This review reflects upon Zigler's influence on US child care, Head Start, Early  Head Start, and prekindergarten programs. It describes the integration of one  major area of developmental science, the field of attachment theory, research,  and intervention, with US child care and early childhood education programs and  policy. The integration of attachment into these systems not only epitomizes  Zigler's overarching canon but also has improved services and advanced  attachment theory and research. Throughout the review, I suggest next steps for  leveraging attachment theory, research, and intervention to improve US child  care and early childhood education systems in ways that both reflect and carry  forward the legacy of Edward Zigler.

A test in two longitudinal birth cohorts.

(2)King's College,London. (3)University of Otago.	Cognitive impairment has been identified as an important aspect of major  depressive disorder (MDD). We tested two theories regarding the association  between MDD and cognitive functioning using data from longitudinal cohort  studies. One theory, the cognitive reserve hypothesis, suggests that higher  cognitive ability in childhood decreases risk of later MDD. The second, the  scarring hypothesis, instead suggests that MDD leads to persistent cognitive  deficits following disorder onset. We tested both theories in the Dunedin Study,  a population-representative cohort followed from birth to midlife and assessed  repeatedly for both cognitive functioning and psychopathology. We also used data  from the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study to test whether childhood  cognitive functioning predicts future MDD risk independent of family-wide and  genetic risk using a discordant twin design. Contrary to both hypotheses, we  found that childhood cognitive functioning did not predict future risk of MDD,  nor did study members with a past history of MDD show evidence of greater  cognitive decline unless MDD was accompanied by other comorbid psychiatric  conditions. Our results thus suggest that low cognitive functioning is related  to comorbidity, but is neither an antecedent nor an enduring consequence of MDD.  Future research may benefit from considering cognitive deficits that occur  during depressive episodes from a transdiagnostic perspective.

Attachment state of mind and childhood experiences of maltreatment as predictors  of sensitive care from infancy through middle childhood: Results from a  longitudinal study of parents involved with Child Protective Services.	Zajac L(1), Raby KL(2), Dozier M(1).	Author information: (1)University of Delaware. (2)University of Utah.	The current longitudinal study examined whether attachment states of mind and  childhood maltreatment predict sensitive caregiving during infancy, early  childhood, and middle childhood among a sample of 178 parents who were involved  with Child Protective Services. Nearly all the parents had themselves  experienced childhood maltreatment based on their reports on the Childhood  Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (Bernstein et al., 2003) when their children  were infants. Adult Attachment Interviews (George, Kaplan, &amp; Main, 1985)  were administered to parents when their children were infants (M = 10.92 months,  SD = 8.66). Parental sensitivity was rated based on observations of parent-child  interactions at three time points: infancy, early childhood, and middle  childhood. During infancy, dismissing states of mind of parents predicted  marginally lower sensitivity scores than autonomous states of mind. In early and  middle childhood, dismissing states of mind of parents predicted significantly  lower sensitivity ratings than autonomous states of mind. Unresolved states of  mind of parents predicted significantly lower sensitivity scores than autonomous  states of mind only during early childhood. Childhood maltreatment was not  significantly associated with parents' sensitivity ratings at all three time  points. Findings suggest that among parents with Child Protective Services  involvement, most of whom had themselves experienced maltreatment, parents'  unresolved states of mind predict insensitive caregiving in early childhood, and  parents' dismissing states of mind predict insensitive caregiving from infancy  through middle childhood.

Research consistently demonstrates that common polymorphic variation in  monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) moderates the influence of childhood maltreatment on  later antisocial behavior, with growing evidence that the "risk" allele (high  vs. low activity) differs for females. However, little is known about how this  Gene × Environment interaction functions to increase risk, or if this risk  pathway is specific to antisocial behavior. Using a prospectively assessed,  longitudinal sample of females (n = 2,004), we examined whether changes in  emotional reactivity (ER) during adolescence mediated associations between this  Gene × Environment and antisocial personality disorder in early adulthood. In  addition, we assessed whether this putative risk pathway also conferred risk for  borderline personality disorder, a related disorder characterized by high ER.  While direct associations between early maltreatment and later personality  pathology did not vary by genotype, there was a significant difference in the  indirect path via ER during adolescence. Consistent with hypotheses, females  with high-activity MAOA genotype who experienced early maltreatment had greater  increases in ER during adolescence, and higher levels of ER predicted both  antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder symptom  severity. Taken together, findings suggest that the interaction between MAOA and  early maltreatment places women at risk for a broader range of personality  pathology via effects on ER.

An examination of the joint effects of adolescent interpersonal styles and  parenting styles on substance use.	Meisel SN(1), Colder CR(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University at Buffalo, State University of New York  Buffalo, NY, USA.	The current study examined how parenting and adolescent interpersonal styles  jointly influence youths' abilities to form close relationships - a central  developmental milestone - yet avoid substance use, which predominantly occurs in  the presence of peers. Nine annual waves from an adolescent sample (N = 387)  were used to assess (a) combinations of interpersonal and parenting styles from  early to middle adolescence using longitudinal latent profile analysis, (b) the  validity of these profiles on indicators of adjustment, and (c) the  relationships between the profiles and growth in substance use across  adolescence as well as substance-related consequences in late adolescence. The  results supported five distinct combinations of interpersonal and parenting  styles, and validity analyses identified both risk and protective profiles. The  protective profile submissive-communal interpersonal style +  high-warmth-authoritative parenting style was associated with indicators of  positive social adjustment (e.g., friendship quality, resistance to peer  influence) as well as lower levels of substance use. Significant differences  also emerged with respect to substance-related consequences. The findings of  this study highlight how combinations of adolescent interpersonal style and  parenting render adolescents more or less successful at navigating peer  relationships while avoiding substance use behaviors.

(3)University of Miami. (4)National Institute of Mental Health.	Behavioral inhibition (BI) is a temperament identified in early childhood that  is associated with risk for anxiety disorders, yet only about half of  behaviorally inhibited children manifest anxiety later in life. We compared  brain function and behavior during extinction recall in a sample of nonanxious  young adults characterized in childhood with BI (n = 22) or with no BI (n = 28).  Three weeks after undergoing fear conditioning and extinction, participants  completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging extinction recall task  assessing memory and threat differentiation for conditioned stimuli. While  self-report and psychophysiological measures of differential conditioning and  extinction were similar across groups, BI-related differences in brain function  emerged during extinction recall. Childhood BI was associated with greater  activation in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in response to cues signaling  safety. This pattern of results may reflect neural correlates that promote  resilience against anxiety in a temperamentally at-risk population.

Author information: (1)Harvard University.	This paper argues that investigators should consider replacing the popular  practice of comparing individuals varying in gender, social class, and/or  ethnicity on one or more continuous measures with a search for kinds of  individuals defined by patterns of properties that include not only their values  on outcome measures but also their gender, social class, and ethnicity.  Investigators who believe that a particular predictor contributes to an outcome  independent of the gender, class, or ethnicity of the participants often  implement statistical procedures that promise to remove the contributions of the  above categories. These analyses lead to misleading conclusions when the  controlled category is correlated with the dependent measures. The final  sections summarize the properties of genders, classes, and ethnic groups that  make distinctive contributions to many psychological outcomes. The paper ends by  noting that a society's ethical beliefs constitute a defensible basis for  ignoring the biological properties associated with these categories in order to  allow members of these groups access to whatever educational or occupational  goals they desire.

FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) alters stress response system functioning, and  childhood maltreatment is associated with methylation of the FKBP5 gene. Yet it  is unknown if maltreatment contributes to change in FKBP5 methylation over time.  The current study draws upon a sample of 231 preschoolers, including 123 with  child welfare documentation of moderate to severe maltreatment in the past 6  months, to understand if maltreatment contributes to change in FKBP5 methylation  over a 6-month period. Review of child protection records and semistructured  interviews in the home were used to assess maltreatment and exposure to other  contextual stressors, as well as service utilization. Methylation of FKBP5 at  two CpG sites in intron 7 was measured from saliva DNA at the time of initial  study enrollment, and 6 months following enrollment. Child maltreatment was  associated with change in FKBP5 methylation over time, but only when children  were exposed to high levels of other contextual stressors. Service utilization  was associated with increases in methylation over time, but only among children  with the FKPB5 rs1360780 protective CC genotype. Methylation of FKBP5 is  sensitive to stress exposure and may be a mechanism linking early adversity to  long-term health and developmental outcomes.

The quality of prenatal maternal mental health, from psychological stress and  depressive symptoms to anxiety and other nonpsychotic mental disorders,  profoundly affects fetal neurodevelopment. Despite the evidence for the  influence of positive mental well-being on health, there is, to our knowledge,  no research examining the possible effects of positive antenatal mental health  on the development of the offspring. Using exploratory bifactor analysis, this  prospective study (n = 1,066) demonstrated the feasibility of using common  psychiatric screening tools to examine the effect of positive maternal mental  health. Antenatal mental health was assessed during 26th week of pregnancy. The  effects on offspring were assessed when the child was 12, 18, and 24 months old.  Results showed that positive antenatal mental health was uniquely associated  with the offspring's cognitive, language and parentally rated competences. This  study shows that the effects of positive maternal mental health are likely to be  specific and distinct from the sheer absence of symptoms of depression or  anxiety.

Normative development of the Child Behavior Checklist Dysregulation Profile from  early childhood to adolescence: Associations with personality pathology.	Deutz MHF(1), Vossen HGM(1), De Haan AD(2), Deković M(1), Van Baar AL(1),  Prinzie P(2).	Author information: (1)Utrecht University. (2)Erasmus University Rotterdam.	The Dysregulation Profile (DP) is a broad indicator of concurrent affective,  behavioral, and cognitive dysregulation, often measured with the  anxious/depressed, aggressive behavior, and attention problems syndrome scales  of the Child Behavior Checklist. Despite an expanding body of research on the  DP, knowledge of the normative developmental course of the DP from early  childhood to adolescence is lacking. Furthermore, although we know that the DP  longitudinally predicts personality pathology, no research yet has examined  whether next to the DP in early childhood, the rate of change of the DP across  development predicts personality pathology. Therefore, using cohort-sequential  latent growth modeling in a population-based sample (N = 668), we examined the  normative developmental course of mother-reported DP from ages 4 to 17 years and  its associations with a wide range of adolescent-reported personality pathology  dimensions 3 years later. The results showed that the DP follows a nonlinear  developmental course with a peak in early adolescence. The initial level of the  DP at age 4 and, to a lesser extent, the rate of change in the DP predicted a  range of personality pathology dimensions in late adolescence. The findings  suggest that the DP is a broad developmental precursor of personality pathology  in late adolescence.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417000955 PMID: 28633688 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

(4)University of Ottawa. (5)King's College London.	Studies 1 and 2 investigated how maternal severe mental illness (SMI) related to  mothers' mind-mindedness (appropriate and nonattuned mind-related comments).  Study 1 showed that mothers with SMI (n = 50) scored lower than psychologically  well mothers for both appropriate and nonattuned comments, whereas mothers with  SMI in Study 2 (n = 22) had elevated levels of nonattuned comments. Study 2 also  tested the efficacy of a single-session video-feedback intervention to  facilitate mind-mindedness in mothers with SMI. The intervention was associated  with a decrease in nonattuned comments, such that on discharge, mothers did not  differ from psychologically well controls. Study 3 assessed infant-mother  attachment security in a small subset of intervention-group mothers from Study 2  (n = 9) and a separate group of standard care mothers (n = 30) at infant mean  age 17.1 months (SD = 2.1). Infants whose mothers completed the intervention  were more likely to be securely attached and less likely to be classified as  insecure-disorganized than those of mothers who received standard care. We  conclude that a single session of video-feedback to facilitate mind-mindedness  in mothers with SMI may have benefits for mother-infant interaction into the  second year of life.

Despite broad evidence suggesting that adversity-exposed youth experience an  impaired ability to recognize emotion in others, the underlying biological  mechanisms remains elusive. This study uses a multimethod approach to target the  neurological substrates of this phenomenon in a well-phenotyped sample of youth  meeting diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Twenty-one  PTSD-afflicted youth and 23 typically developing (TD) controls completed  clinical interview schedules, an emotion recognition task with eye-tracking, and  an implicit emotion processing task during functional magnetic resonance imaging  )fMRI). PTSD was associated with decreased accuracy in identification of angry,  disgust, and neutral faces as compared to TD youth. Of note, these impairments  occurred despite the normal deployment of visual attention in youth with PTSD  relative to TD youth. Correlation with a related fMRI task revealed a group by  accuracy interaction for amygdala-hippocampus functional connectivity (FC) for  angry expressions, where TD youth showed a positive relationship between anger  accuracy and amygdala-hippocampus FC; this relationship was reversed in youth  with PTSD. These findings are a novel characterization of impaired threat  recognition within a well-phenotyped population of severe pediatric PTSD.  Further, the differential amygdala-hippocampus FC identified in youth with PTSD  may imply aberrant efficiency of emotional contextualization circuits.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001704 PMID: 33487187

A recent suicidal drive hypothesis posits that psychotic experiences (PEs) may  serve to externalize internally generated and self-directed threat (i.e.,  self-injurious/suicidal behavior [SIB]) in order to optimize survival; however,  it must first be demonstrated that such internal threat can both precede and  inform PEs. The current study conducted the first known bidirectional analysis  of SIB and PEs to test whether SIB could be considered as a plausible antecedent  for PEs. Prospective data were utilized from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk)  Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative birth cohort of 2232 twins,  that captured SIB (any self-harm or suicidal attempt) and PEs at ages 12 and 18  years. Cross-lagged panel models demonstrated that the association between SIB  at age 12 and PEs at age 18 was as strong as the association between PEs at age  12 and SIB at age 18. Indeed, the best representation of the data was a model  where these paths were constrained to be equal (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.63-3.79).  Clinical interview case notes for those who reported both SIB and PEs at age 18,  revealed that PEs were explicitly characterized by SIB/threat/death-related  content for 39% of cases. These findings justify further investigation of the  suicidal drive hypothesis.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001728 PMID: 33402232

Individual differences in sensitivity to the early environment as a function of  amygdala and hippocampus volumes: An exploratory analysis in 12-year-old boys.

Children differ in their response to environmental exposures, with some being  more sensitive to contextual factors than others. According to theory, such  variability is the result of individual differences in neurobiological  sensitivity to environmental features, with some individuals generally more  affected by both negative and/or positive experiences. In this exploratory study  we tested whether left and right amygdala and hippocampus volumes (corrected for  total brain size) account for individual differences in response to  environmental influences in a sample of 62 boys. Cumulative general  environmental quality, ranging from low to high, was measured across the first 9  years and child behavior was reported by teachers when boys were 12-13 years  old. According to analyses, only the left amygdala volume - not any of the other  brain volumes - emerged as an important brain region for sensitivity to positive  environmental aspects. Boys with a larger left amygdala benefited significantly  more from higher environmental quality than boys with a smaller left amygdala  whilst not being more vulnerable to lower quality. Besides providing preliminary  evidence for differences in environmental sensitivity due to brain structure,  the results also point to the left amygdala as having a specific role regarding  the response to environmental influences.

Differential susceptibility effects of oxytocin gene (OXT) polymorphisms and  perceived parenting on social anxiety among adolescents.	Olofsdotter S(1), Åslund C(1), Furmark T(1), Comasco E(1), Nilsson KW(1).	Author information: (1)Uppsala University.	Social anxiety is one of the most commonly reported mental health problems among  adolescents, and it has been suggested that parenting style influences an  adolescent's level of anxiety. A context-dependent effect of oxytocin on human  social behavior has been proposed; however, research on the oxytocin gene (OXT)  has mostly been reported without considering contextual factors. This study  investigated the interactions between parenting style and polymorphic variations  in the OXT gene in association with social anxiety symptoms in a community  sample of adolescents (n = 1,359). Two single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to  OXT, rs4813625 and rs2770378, were genotyped. Social anxiety and perceived  parenting style were assessed by behavioral questionnaires. In interaction  models adjusted for sex, significant interaction effects with parenting style  were observed for both variants in relation to social anxiety. The nature of the  interactions was in line with the differential susceptibility framework for  rs4813625, whereas for rs2770378 the results indicated a diathesis-stress type  of interaction. The findings may be interpreted from the perspective of the  social salience hypothesis of oxytocin, with rs4813625 affecting social anxiety  levels along a perceived unsafe-safe social context dimension.

A latent class analysis of parent-child discrepancies in reports of peer  victimization: Associations to child sexual abuse status and psychological  adjustment.

(2)Département de sexologie, Université du Québec à Montréal, Montréal, Québec,  Canada.	Researchers face an important challenge when assessing peer victimization in  children, since self-reports are often discrepant with parent-reports. A latent  class analysis identified patterns of response to items assessing peer  victimization, which were either divergent or convergent between the parent and  the child. Classes were then compared on the child sexual abuse status and on  various behavioral and social outcomes. Participants were 720 school-aged child  victims of sexual abuse and a comparison group of 173 nonvictims and their  caregivers. We identified two discordant subgroups (self-identified and  parent-identified) and two concordant groups (nonvictims and concordant victims  of peer victimization). Compared to children of the comparison group, sexually  abused children were five times more likely to be identified as targets of peer  victimization solely by their parent than the contrary. Sexually abused children  with concordant reports of peer victimization showed the poorest adjustment on  all studied outcomes assessed 6 months later. Children who discounted  experiencing peer victimization while their parent reported it were also at risk  of maladjustment. Results underscore the importance of supplementing  self-reports with other available sources of information, especially in young  and vulnerable populations who may be inclined to discount their victimization  experiences.

How do childhood intelligence and early psychosocial adversity influence income  attainment among adult extremely low birth weight survivors? A test of the  cognitive reserve hypothesis.	Dobson KG(1), Ferro MA(2), Boyle MH(1), Schmidt LA(1), Saigal S(1), Van Lieshout  RJ(1).	Author information: (1)McMaster University. (2)University of Waterloo.	Perinatal and later postnatal adversities have been shown to adversely affect  socioeconomic trajectories, while enhanced early cognitive abilities improve  them. However, little is known about the combined influence of these exposures  on social mobility. In this study, we examined if childhood IQ moderated the  association between four different types of postnatal adversity (childhood  socioeconomic disadvantage, childhood sexual abuse, lifetime psychiatric  disorder, and trait neuroticism) and annual earnings at 30-35 years of age in a  sample of 88 extremely low birth weight survivors. Our results suggested that  higher childhood IQ was associated with greater personal income at age 30-35.  Extremely low birth weight survivors who did not face psychological adversities  and who had higher childhood IQ reported higher income in adulthood. However,  those who faced psychological adversity and had higher childhood IQ generally  reported lower income in adulthood. Our findings suggest that cognitive reserve  may not protect preterm survivors against the complex web of risk factors  affecting their later socioeconomic attainment.

Individual differences in anxiety trajectories from Grades 2 to 8: Impact of the  middle school transition.	Nelemans SA(1), Hale WW(1), Branje SJT(1), Meeus WHJ(1), Rudolph KD(2).	Author information: (1)Utrecht University. (2)University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.	This study examined the impact of the middle school transition on general  anxiety trajectories from middle childhood to middle adolescence, as well as how  youths' individual vulnerability and exposure to contextual stressors were  associated with anxiety trajectories. Participants were 631 youth (47% boys, M  age = 7.96 years at Time 1), followed for 7 successive years from second to  eighth grade. Teachers reported on youths' individual vulnerability to anxiety  (anxious solitude) in second grade; youth reported on their anxiety in second to  eighth grade and aspects of their social contexts particularly relevant to the  school transition (school hassles, peer victimization, parent-child relationship  quality, and friendship quality) in sixth to eighth grade. The results revealed  two subgroups that showed either strongly increasing (5%) or decreasing (14%)  levels of anxiety across the transition and two subgroups with fairly stable  levels of either high (11%) or low (70%) anxiety over time. Youth in the latter  two subgroups could be distinguished based on their individual vulnerability to  anxiety, whereas youth with increasing anxiety reported more contextual  stressors and less contextual support than youth with decreasing anxiety. In  sum, findings suggest that the middle school transition has the potential to  alter developmental trajectories of anxiety for some youth, for better or for  worse.

Adverse childhood experiences are significant risk factors in the development of  adolescent borderline personality disorder symptoms (BPDs). Theorists have  posited that two personality vulnerabilities factors, self-criticism and  dependency, may inform our understanding of this relationship. However, no  research has examined the associations between early negative experiences,  personality vulnerabilities, and adolescent BPDs. The current study aimed to  identify profiles of dependency and self-criticism to examine the associations  of these profiles with cumulative forms of childhood maltreatment (CM) and BPDs  as well as to explore the mediating and moderating role of vulnerable  personality profiles in the relationship between cumulative CM and BPDs. Two  hundred and forty-one nonclinical and clinical adolescents participated in the  study (Mage = 16.37, SD = 1.84). The findings indicated three different  profiles: average dependent profile, dependent and self-critical profile, and  self-critical profile. Individuals in the average dependent profile presented  lower levels of CM and BPDs. Mediation analyses showed that relative to the  average dependent profile, a higher cumulative CM history predicted a higher  probability of belonging in the dependent and self-critical profile or the  self-critical profile and, in turn, this was associated with higher levels of  BPDs. No moderating effects of profiles of dependency and self-criticism were  found.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420002151 PMID: 33494855

Contexts of war and displacement increase the  likelihood of early marriage and childbearing. Given the developmentally  sensitive periods of early childhood and adolescence, adolescent motherhood in  conflict-affected contexts may put a family at risk intergenerationally. We  propose that the specifics of normative neuroendocrine development during  adolescence, including increased sensitivity to stress, pose additional risks to  adolescent girls and their young children in the face of war and displacement,  with potential lifelong consequences for health and development. This paper  proposes a developmental, dual-generational framework for research and policies  to better understand and address the needs of adolescent mothers and their small  children. We draw from the literature on developmental stress physiology,  adolescent parenthood in contexts of war and displacement internationally, and  developmental cultural neurobiology. We also identify culturally meaningful  sources of resilience and provide a review of the existing literature on  interventions supporting adolescent mothers and their offspring. We aim to honor  Edward Zigler's groundbreaking life and career by integrating basic  developmental science with applied intervention and policy.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457942000156X PMID: 33517930

Affective reactivity to daily racial discrimination as a prospective predictor  of depressive symptoms in African American graduate and postgraduate students.	Ong AD(1), Burrow AL(1).	Author information: (1)Cornell University.	This study examined whether individual differences in affective reactivity,  defined as changes in positive or negative affect in response to daily racial  discrimination, predicted subsequent depressive symptoms. Participants were  African American graduate and postgraduate students (N = 174; M age = 30 years)  recruited for a measurement-burst study. Data on depressive symptoms were  gathered at two assessment points 1 year apart. Affective reactivity data was  obtained from participants via a 14-day diary study of daily racial  discrimination and affect. Participants who experienced pronounced increases in  negative affect on days when racial discrimination occurred had elevated  depressive symptoms 1 year later. Heightened positive affect reactivity was also  associated with more depressive symptoms at follow-up. The results suggest that  affective reactivity (either greater increases in negative affect or greater  decreases in positive affect in the context of racial discrimination) may be an  underlying psychological mechanism that confers vulnerability to future  depressive symptoms.

(2)Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.	The present study examined the developmental value of parsing different forms of  children's risky involvement in interparental conflict as predictors of  children's subsequent psychological adjustment. Participants included a diverse  sample of 243 preschool children (Mage = 4.6 years) and their mothers across two  measurement occasions spaced 2 years apart. Three forms of risky involvement  (i.e., cautious, caregiving, and coercive) were identified using maternal  narratives describing children's emotional and behavioral reactivity during and  immediately following interparental conflict. Utilizing a multimethod,  multi-informant design, findings revealed that each form of involvement  prospectively predicted unique configurations of children's developmental  outcomes. Greater coercive involvement was associated with higher levels of  externalizing problems, callous and unemotional traits, and extraversion. Higher  levels of caregiving involvement were linked with greater separation anxiety.  Finally, cautious involvement predicted more separation anxiety and social  withdrawal.

Identifying the potential pathways linking childhood abuse to depression and  suicidal ideation is critical for developing effective interventions. This study  investigated implicit self-esteem-unconscious valenced self-evaluation-as a  potential pathway linking childhood abuse with depression and suicidal ideation.  A sample of youth aged 8-16 years (N = 240) completed a self-esteem Implicit  Association Test (IAT) and assessments of abuse exposure, and psychopathology  symptoms, including depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, and externalizing  symptoms. Psychopathology symptoms were re-assessed 1-3 years later. Childhood  abuse was positively associated with baseline and follow-up depression symptoms  and suicidal ideation severity, and negatively associated with implicit  self-esteem. Lower implicit self-esteem was associated with both depression and  suicidal ideation assessed concurrently and predicted significant increases in  depression and suicidal ideation over the longitudinal follow-up period. Lower  implicit self-esteem was also associated with baseline anxiety, externalizing  symptoms, and a general psychopathology factor (i.e. p-factor). We found an  indirect effect of childhood abuse on baseline and follow-up depression symptoms  and baseline suicidal ideation through implicit self-esteem. These findings  point to implicit self-esteem as a potential mechanism linking childhood abuse  to depression and suicidal ideation.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420002217 PMID: 33594963

A person-centered approach to the assessment of early life stress: Associations  with the volume of stress-sensitive brain regions in early adolescence.	King LS(1), Humphreys KL(1), Camacho MC(2), Gotlib IH(1).	Author information: (1)Stanford University. (2)University of Pittsburgh.	Researchers are becoming increasingly interested in linking specific forms of  early life stress (ELS) to specific neurobiological markers, including  alterations in the morphology of stress-sensitive brain regions. We used a  person-centered, multi-informant approach to investigate the associations of  specific constellations of ELS with hippocampal and amygdala volume in a  community sample of 211 9- to 13-year-old early adolescents. Further, we  compared this approach to a cumulative risk model of ELS, in which ELS was  quantified by the total number of stressors reported. Using latent class  analysis, we identified three classes of ELS (labeled typical/low, family  instability, and direct victimization) that were distinguished by experiences of  family instability and victimization. Adolescents in the direct victimization  class had significantly smaller hippocampal volume than did adolescents in the  typical/low class; ELS classes were not significantly associated with amygdala  volume. The cumulative risk model of ELS had a poorer fit than did the  person-centered model; moreover, cumulative ELS was not significantly associated  with hippocampal or amygdala volume. Our results underscore the utility of  taking a person-centered approach to identify alterations in stress-sensitive  brain regions based on constellations of ELS, and suggest victimization is  specifically associated with hippocampal hypotrophy observed in early  adolescence.

Temperamental behavioral inhibition (BI) is a robust endophenotype for anxiety  characterized by increased sensitivity to novelty. Controlling parenting can  reinforce children's wariness by rewarding signs of distress. Fine-grained,  dynamic measures are needed to better understand both how children perceive  their parent's behaviors and the mechanisms supporting evident relations between  parenting and socioemotional functioning. The current study examined dyadic  attractor patterns (average mean durations) with state space grids, using  children's attention patterns (captured via mobile eye tracking) and parental  behavior (positive reinforcement, teaching, directives, intrusion), as functions  of child BI and parent anxiety. Forty 5- to 7-year-old children and their  primary caregivers completed a set of challenging puzzles, during which the  child wore a head-mounted eye tracker. Child BI was positively correlated with  proportion of parent's time spent teaching. Child age was negatively related,  and parent anxiety level was positively related, to parent-focused/controlling  parenting attractor strength. There was a significant interaction between parent  anxiety level and child age predicting parent-focused/controlling parenting  attractor strength. This study is a first step to examining the co-occurrence of  parenting behavior and child attention in the context of child BI and parental  anxiety levels.

An impairment in recognizing distress is implicated in the development and  severity of antisocial behavior. It has been hypothesized that a lack of  attention to the eyes plays a role, but supporting evidence is limited. We  developed a computerized training to improve emotion recognition in children and  examined the role of eye gaze before and after training. Children referred into  an intervention program to prevent antisocial outcomes completed an emotion  recognition task with concurrent eye tracking. Those with emotion recognition  impairments (n = 54, mean age: 8.72 years, 78% male) completed the training,  while others (n = 38, mean age: 8.95 years, 84% male) continued with their usual  interventions. Emotion recognition and eye gaze were reassessed in all children  8 weeks later. Impaired negative emotion recognition was significantly related  to severity of behavioral problems at pretest. Children who completed the  training significantly improved in emotion recognition; eye gaze did not  contribute to impairment or improvement in emotion recognition. This study  confirms the role of emotion recognition in severity of disruptive behavior and  shows that a targeted intervention can quickly improve emotion impairments. The  training works by improving children's ability to appraise emotional stimuli  rather than by influencing their visual attention.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001091 PMID: 33432899

Childhood maltreatment (CM) is a known risk factor for adolescent pregnancy.  Sleep disturbances and psychological distress, both common negative sequelae of  CM, often co-occur during pregnancy, although directionality remains unclear.  Furthermore, little is known about how CM affects sleep-distress associations  during pregnancy. In pregnant adolescents, we examined: (a) whether there are  significant predictive associations from CM to sleep quality and distress and  (b) bidirectional influences of distress and sleep quality. Healthy pregnant  adolescents (n = 204) were recruited before or during the 2nd trimester. CM was  assessed at enrollment; sleep quality and distress were assessed in the 2nd and  3rd trimesters. Hypotheses were tested using path analysis. Findings revealed  that CM was associated with worse 2nd trimester sleep quality and distress (β =  .19, p < .05 for sleep; β = .30, p < .001 for distress). Higher levels of 2nd  trimester distress were associated with lower 3rd trimester sleep quality (β =  .19, p < .05). Findings provide novel information about (a) associations from CM  to prenatal mood and sleep in pregnant adolescents, and (b) sleep-distress  directionality over the course of pregnancy. These results have implications for  better understanding the ways in which CM potentially exerts influences later in  life, and for targeting interventions to address physical and mental health  during pregnancy.

(2)Department of Psychology, New York University - Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, UAE. (3)Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of  Delaware,Newark, USA.	This study evaluated whether Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC), a  parenting intervention, altered the attachment representations of parents  (average age of 34.2 years) who had been referred to Child Protective Services  (CPS) due to risk for child maltreatment when their children were infants.  Approximately 7 years after completing the intervention, parents who had been  randomized to receive ABC (n = 43) exhibited greater secure base script  knowledge than parents who had been randomized to receive a control intervention  (n = 51). Low-risk parents (n = 79) exhibited greater secure base script  knowledge than CPS-referred parents who had received a control intervention.  However, levels of secure base script knowledge did not differ between low-risk  parents and CPS-referred parents who had received the ABC intervention. In  addition, secure base script knowledge was positively associated with parental  sensitivity during interactions with their 8-year-old children among low-risk  and CPS-referred parents. Mediational analyses supported the idea that the ABC  intervention enhanced parents' sensitivity 7 years later indirectly via  increases in parents' secure base script knowledge.

From child maltreatment to emerging adult problem drinking: Identification of a  multilevel internalizing pathway among African American youth.	Handley ED(1), Rogosch FA(1), Cicchetti D(1).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	The present study tested the role of FKBP5 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) genetic  variation in an internalizing pathway from child maltreatment to emerging adult  problem drinking among a sample of African American youth (N = 280) followed  prospectively from ages 11 to 20. Specifically, whether childhood internalizing  symptoms and emerging adult tension reduction alcohol expectancies sequentially  mediate the effect of child maltreatment on emerging adult problem drinking and  whether FKBP5 moderates these associations were investigated. The results  indicate that individuals with at least one copy of the FKBP5 CATT haplotype  (minor alleles) are more vulnerable to traversing the hypothesized internalizing  pathway of risk than individuals without this genotypic profile. Taken together  our findings highlight the importance of FKBP5 genetic variation in the context  of early adversity; support the role of two prospective sequential mediators of  an internalizing pathway to problematic drinking, namely, childhood  internalizing symptoms and emerging adult tension reduction alcohol  expectancies; and identify a subgroup of maltreated children most susceptible to  progressing along this less common pathway of risk.

(2)Child Development, Erikson Institute, Chicago, Illinois, USA. (3)Child Development, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.	The United States is entering a pivotal period in history, led by extraordinary  shifts in the demographic makeup of children who are in need of medical,  educational, and developmental services. For the first time in this country's  history, the majority of children are being born to non-white populations.  Simultaneously, racism (personal, institutional, and systemic) is now being  recognized as a powerful social determinant of children's mental and physical  health by the time they enter kindergarten. It is crucial to evaluate how early  childhood development (ECD) settings are prepared to authentically engage  racially diverse children. In this paper, we critically analyze the narratives  of the architect of Head Start, Dr. Edward Zigler, and investigate his evolving  contributions to early childhood programming. We propose that Zigler's  conceptualization of culture and its impact on children's development, although  advanced for his time, had historical limitations that have perpetuated the  personal, institutional, and systemic racism that children of color experience  in early childhood settings. This paper concludes with suggestions to include  topics covering implicit bias, white privilege, and the impact of slavery,  colonization, and oppression as core principles in professional training. Only  then will we be able to eliminate racism across early childhood settings in the  United States.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001960 PMID: 33551017

The triarchic model was advanced as an integrative, trait-based framework for  investigating psychopathy using different assessment methods and across  developmental periods. Recent research has shown that the triarchic traits of  boldness, meanness, and disinhibition can be operationalized effectively in  youth, but longitudinal research is needed to realize the model's potential to  advance developmental understanding of psychopathy. We report on the creation  and validation of scale measures of the triarchic traits using questionnaire  items available in the University of Southern California Risk Factors for  Antisocial Behavior (RFAB) project, a large-scale longitudinal study of the  development of antisocial behavior that includes measures from multiple  modalities (self-report, informant rating, clinical-diagnostic, task-behavioral,  physiological). Using a construct-rating and psychometric refinement approach,  we developed triarchic scales that showed acceptable reliability, expected  intercorrelations, and good temporal stability. The scales showed  theory-consistent relations with external criteria including measures of  psychopathy, internalizing/externalizing psychopathology, antisocial behavior,  and substance use. Findings demonstrate the viability of measuring triarchic  traits in the RFAB sample, extend the known nomological network of these traits  into the developmental realm, and provide a foundation for follow-up studies  examining the etiology of psychopathic traits and their relations with  multimodal measures of cognitive-affective function and proneness to clinical  problems.

Millions of children worldwide are raised in institutionalized settings.  Unfortunately, institutionalized rearing is often characterized by psychosocial  deprivation, leading to difficulties in numerous social, emotional, physical,  and cognitive skills. One such skill is the ability to recognize emotional  facial expressions. Children with a history of institutional rearing tend to be  worse at recognizing emotions in facial expressions than their peers, and this  deficit likely affects social interactions. However, emotional information is  also conveyed vocally, and neither prosodic information processing nor the  cross-modal integration of facial and prosodic emotional expressions have been  investigated in these children to date. We recorded electroencephalograms (EEG)  while 47 children under institutionalized care (IC) (n = 24) or biological  family care (BFC) (n = 23) viewed angry, happy, or neutral facial expressions  while listening to pseudowords with angry, happy, or neutral prosody. The  results indicate that 20- to 40-month-olds living in IC have event-related  potentials (ERPs) over midfrontal brain regions that are less sensitive to  incongruent facial and prosodic emotions relative to children under BFC, and  that their brain responses to prosody are less lateralized. Children under IC  also showed midfrontal ERP differences in processing of angry prosody,  indicating that institutionalized rearing may specifically affect the processing  of anger.

It really does take a village: The role of neighbors in the etiology of  nonaggressive rule-breaking behavior.	Burt SA(1), Pearson AL(1), Rzotkiewicz A(1), Klump KL(1), Neiderhiser JM(2).	Author information: (1)Michigan State University. (2)The Pennsylvania State University.	Although there is growing recognition that disadvantaged contexts attenuate  genetic influences on youth misbehavior, it is not yet clear how this dampening  occurs. The current study made use of a "geographic contagion" model to isolate  specific contexts contributing to this effect, with a focus on nonaggressive  rule-breaking behaviors (RB) in the families' neighbors. Our sample included 847  families residing in or near modestly-to-severely disadvantaged neighborhoods  who participated in the Michigan State University Twin Registry. Neighborhood  sampling techniques were used to recruit neighbors residing within 5km of a  given family (the mean number of neighbors assessed per family was 13.09; range,  1-47). Analyses revealed clear evidence of genotype-environment interactions by  neighbor RB, such that sibling-level shared environmental influences on child RB  increased with increasing neighbor self-reports of their own RB, whereas genetic  influences decreased. Moreover, this moderation appeared to be driven by  geographic proximity to neighbors. Sensitivity analyses further indicated that  this effect was specifically accounted for by higher levels of neighbor  joblessness, rather than elements of neighbor RB that would contribute to  neighborhood blight or crime. Such findings provocatively suggest that future  genotype-environment interactions studies should integrate the dynamic networks  of social contagion theory.

While previous studies suggest that both genetic and environmental factors play  an important role in the development of autism-related traits, little is known  about potential biological mechanisms underlying these associations. Using data  from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), we examined  prospective associations between DNA methylation (DNAm: nbirth = 804, nage 7 =  877) and trajectories of social communication deficits at age 8-17 years.  Methylomic variation at three loci across the genome (false discovery rate =  0.048) differentiated children following high (n = 80) versus low (n = 724)  trajectories of social communication deficits. This differential DNAm was  specific to the neonatal period and not observed at 7 years of age. Associations  between DNAm and trajectory membership remained robust after controlling for  co-occurring mental health problems (i.e., hyperactivity/inattention, conduct  problems). The three loci identified at birth were not replicated in the  Generation R Study. However, to the best of our knowledge, ALSPAC is the only  study to date that is prospective enough to examine DNAm in relation to  longitudinal trajectories of social communication deficits from childhood to  adolescence. Although the present findings might point to potentially novel  sites that differentiate between a high versus low trajectory of social  communication deficits, the results should be considered tentative until further  replicated.

(2)Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences & Department of Medicine,  Division of Hematology-Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.	This study evaluated whether children with higher adverse childhood experiences  (ACE) scores had alterations in immune cell gene expression profiles. RNA  sequencing was conducted on dried blood spot samples from 37 generally healthy  English-speaking children (age 5-11) who were recruited from well-child visits  at a university-affiliated pediatric practice. The Whole Child Assessment was  used to assess ACE exposure. Primary analyses examined an a priori-specified  composite of 19 pro-inflammatory gene transcripts. Secondary analyses examined a  34-gene composite assessing Type I interferon response, and used Transcript  Origin Analyses to identify cellular mechanisms. After controlling for age, body  mass index percentile, sex, race/ethnicity, current insurance status, and  household smoking exposure, pro-inflammatory gene expression was elevated by  0.094 log2 RNA expression units with each Child-ACE total score point (p =  .019). Type I interferon gene expression was similarly upregulated (0.103; p =  .008). Transcript origin analyses implicated CD8+ T cell as the primary sources  of gene transcripts upregulated, and nonclassical (CD16+) monocytes as sources  of downregulated transcripts. These preliminary analyses suggest that  parent-reported ACE exposures are associated with increased expression of both  inflammatory and interferon gene transcripts in children's circulating blood  cells.

Explaining the accumulation of victimization in vulnerable children:  Interpersonal violence among children traumatized by war and disaster in a  children's home in Sri Lanka.	Rajan V(1), Neuner F(1), Catani C(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany.	Research in postconflict settings indicated that children's exposure to war and  natural disaster is a significant predictor of experiencing violence within  their families. However, it is unclear if this effect is driven by  characteristics of traumatized children or their parents. To disentangle these  different factors we conducted a survey in a children's home in Sri Lanka. A  total of 146 institutionalized children (aged 8 to 17) were interviewed using  standardized questionnaires administered by local senior counselors in order to  assess children's exposure to mass trauma, family violence, and violence in the  institution as well as their mental health. Linear regression analyses revealed  that, controlling for potential confounds, previous exposure to civil war was a  significant predictor of violence by guardians in the children's home. In  addition, previous exposure to family violence was a significant predictor of  violence by peers in the institutions. A mediation analysis showed that  children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems partly mediated the  relationship between violence prior to the admission to the children's home and  violence in the children's home. The findings of our study provide evidence for  the assumption that the transmission of mass trauma into interpersonal violence  can occur independently from parents through children's psychopathology.

Family Minds: A randomized controlled trial of a group intervention to improve  foster parents' reflective functioning.	Adkins T(1), Reisz S(2), Hasdemir D(1), Fonagy P(3).

(3)Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology,  University College London, London, UK.	Family Minds is a brief group psychoeducational parenting intervention designed  to increase the reflective functioning (RF) and mentalization skills of foster  parents. RF is important for foster parents who have to build relationships with  children whose adverse experiences increase their risk for psychosocial  challenges. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) for Family Minds was conducted  in Texas with 89 foster parents. The main aims of this study were to examine  whether the intervention could significantly increase the RF/mentalization  skills of the foster parents and decrease their parenting stress. After 6 weeks,  compared with the control group, intervention foster parents improved their RF  via a lowering of pre-mentalizing and also significantly decreased parenting  stress related to parent-child dysfunctional interactions. Other measures of RF  and parenting stress showed no significant differences between groups. Foster  child behavior was not significantly different between groups, although data at  6 months showed a possible lowering of internalizing symptoms for children of  intervention parents. This RCT provides some encouraging evidence that Family  Minds may increase RF in foster parents, improve parental sensitivity and their  ability to emotionally regulate, decrease parenting stress related to  challenging interactions with their foster children, and possibly decrease  children's internalizing behavior.

Institutional caregiving is associated with significant deviations from  species-expected caregiving, altering the normative sequence of attachment  formation and placing children at risk for long-term emotional difficulties.  However, little is known about factors that can promote resilience following  early institutional caregiving. In the current study, we investigated how  adaptations in affective processing (i.e., positive valence bias) and  family-level protective factors (i.e., secure parent-child relationships)  moderate risk for internalizing symptoms in previously institutionalized (PI)  youth. Children and adolescents with and without a history of institutional care  performed a laboratory-based affective processing task and self-reported  measures of parent-child relationship security. PI youth were more likely than  comparison youth to show positive valence biases when interpreting ambiguous  facial expressions. Both positive valence bias and parent-child relationship  security moderated the association between institutional care and  parent-reported internalizing symptoms, such that greater positive valence bias  and more secure parent-child relationships predicted fewer symptoms in PI youth.  However, when both factors were tested concurrently, parent-child relationship  security more strongly moderated the link between PI status and internalizing  symptoms. These findings suggest that both individual-level adaptations in  affective processing and family-level factors of secure parent-child  relationships may ameliorate risk for internalizing psychopathology following  early institutional caregiving.

(2)Erasmus University Medical CenterRotterdam.	The parent-child attachment relationship plays an important role in the  development of the infant's stress regulation system. However, genetic and  epigenetic factors such as FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) genotype and DNA  methylation have also been associated with hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis  functioning. In the current study, we examined how parent-child dyadic  regulation works in concert with genetic and epigenetic aspects of stress  regulation. We study the associations of attachment, extreme maternal  insensitivity, FKBP5 single nucleotide polymorphism 1360780, and FKBP5  methylation, with cortisol reactivity to the Strange Situation Procedure in 298  14-month-old infants. The results indicate that FKBP5 methylation moderates the  associations of FKBP5 genotype and resistant attachment with cortisol  reactivity. We conclude that the inclusion of epigenetics in the field of  developmental psychopathology may lead to a more precise picture of the  interplay between genetic makeup and parenting in shaping stress reactivity.

A considerable body of evidence suggests that early caregiving may affect the  short-term functioning and longer term development of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Despite this, most research to date  has been cross-sectional in nature or restricted to relatively short-term  longitudinal follow-ups. More important, there is a paucity of research on the  role of caregiving in low- and middle-income countries, where the protective  effects of high-quality care in buffering the child's developing stress  regulation systems may be crucial. In this paper, we report findings from a  longitudinal study (N = 232) conducted in an impoverished periurban settlement  in Cape Town, South Africa. We measured caregiving sensitivity and security of  attachment in infancy and followed children up at age 13 years, when we  conducted assessments of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical axis reactivity,  as indexed by salivary cortisol during the Trier Social Stress Test. The  findings indicated that insecure attachment was predictive of reduced cortisol  responses to social stress, particularly in boys, and that attachment status  moderated the impact of contextual adversity on stress responses: secure  children in highly adverse circumstances did not show the blunted cortisol  response shown by their insecure counterparts. Some evidence was found that  sensitivity of care in infancy was also associated with cortisol reactivity, but  in this case, insensitivity was associated with heightened cortisol reactivity,  and only for girls. The discussion focuses on the potentially important role of  caregiving in the long-term calibration of the stress system and the need to  better understand the social and biological mechanisms shaping the stress  response across development in low- and middle-income countries.

Bailey HN(1), Tarabulsy GM(2), Moran G(3), Pederson DR(3), Bento S(3).	Author information: (1)University of Guelph. (2)Laval University. (3)Western University.	Research on attachment transmission has focused on variable-centered analyses,  where hypotheses are tested by examining linear associations between variables.  The purpose of this study was to apply a relationship-centered approach to data  analysis, where adult states of mind, maternal sensitivity, and infant  attachment were conceived as being three components of a single,  intergenerational relationship. These variables were assessed in 90 adolescent  and 99 adult mother-infant dyads when infants were 12 months old. Initial  variable-centered analyses replicated the frequently observed associations  between these three core attachment variables. Relationship-based, latent class  analyses then revealed that the most common pattern among young mother dyads  featured maternal unresolved trauma, insensitive interactive behavior, and  disorganized infant attachment (61%), whereas the most prevalent adult mother  dyad relationship pattern involved maternal autonomy, sensitive maternal  behavior, and secure infant attachment (59%). Three less prevalent relationship  patterns were also observed. Moderation analyses revealed that the  adolescent-adult mother distinction differentiated between secure and  disorganized intergenerational relationship patterns, whereas experience of  traumatic events distinguished between disorganized and avoidant patterns.  Finally, socioeconomic status distinguished between avoidant and secure  patterns. Results emphasize the value of a relationship-based approach, adding  an angle of understanding to the study of attachment transmission.

(4)University of North Carolina at Greensboro.	The first aim of the current study was to examine the latent structure of  attachment states of mind as assessed by the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)  among three groups of parents of children at risk for insecure attachments:  parents who adopted internationally (N = 147), foster parents (N = 300), and  parents living in poverty and involved with Child Protective Services (CPS; N =  284). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated the state of mind rating scales  loaded on two factors reflecting adults' preoccupied and dismissing states of  mind. Taxometric analyses indicated the variation in adults' preoccupied states  of mind was more consistent with a dimensional than a categorical model, whereas  results for dismissing states of mind were indeterminate. The second aim was to  examine the degree to which the attachment states of mind of internationally  adoptive and foster parents differ from those of poverty/CPS-referred parents  and low-risk parents. After controlling for parental age, sex, ethnicity, and  socioeconomic status, (a) internationally adoptive parents had lower scores on  the dismissing dimension than the sample of community parents described by  Haltigan, Leerkes, Supple, and Calkins (2014); (b) foster parents did not differ  from community parents on either the dismissing or the preoccupied AAI  dimension; and (c) both internationally adoptive and foster parents had lower  scores on the preoccupied dimension than poverty/CPS-referred parents. Analyses  using the traditional AAI categories provided convergent evidence that (a)  internationally adoptive parents were more likely to be classified as having an  autonomous state of mind than low-risk North American mothers based on  Bakermans-Kranenburg and van IJzendoorn's (2009) meta-analytic estimates, (b)  the rates of autonomous states of mind did not differ between foster and  low-risk parents, and	(c) both internationally adoptive and foster parents were less likely to be  classified as having a preoccupied state of mind than poverty/CPS-referred  parents.

Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2018 Feb;30(1):367-370.	The present report used data from the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and  Adaptation to investigate the factor structure and childhood abuse and/or  neglect related antecedents of adults' attachment states of mind in a high-risk  sample. Adult Attachment Interviews (AAIs) were collected when participants were  age 26 years (N = 164) and Current Relationship Interviews (CRIs) were collected  from participants (N = 116) and their romantic partners when target participants  were between ages 20 and 28 years (M = 25.3 years). For both the AAI and the  CRI, exploratory factor analyses revealed that (a) attachment state of mind  scales loaded on two weakly correlated dimensions reflecting dismissing and  preoccupied states of mind and (b) ratings of unresolved discourse loaded on the  same factor as indicators of preoccupied states of mind. Experiencing any  subtype of abuse and/or neglect, especially during multiple developmental  periods, and experiencing multiple subtypes of abuse and/or neglect during  childhood were associated with risk for preoccupied (but not dismissing) AAI  states of mind regarding childhood relationships with caregivers. Analyses  focused on the particular subtypes, and perpetrators indicated that the  predictive significance of childhood abuse/neglect for adult's AAI preoccupied  states of mind was specific to experiences of abuse (but not neglect)  perpetrated by primary caregivers. In addition, experiencing chronic or multiple  subtypes of childhood abuse and/or neglect increased risk for dismissing (but  not preoccupied) CRI states of mind regarding adult romantic partners.

Associations between early internalizing symptoms and speed of transition  through stages of alcohol involvement.	Menary KR(1), Corbin WR(1), Chassin L(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University.	Alcohol use disorders and internalizing disorders are highly comorbid, but how  this comorbidity unfolds over development is not well understood. The present  study investigated effects of internalizing symptoms in late childhood on speed  of transition between three alcohol involvement milestones: first drink, first  binge, and onset of first alcohol dependence symptom. Greater early  internalizing symptoms were expected to predict a later age of first drink, a  slower transition from first drink to first binge, and a faster transition from  first binge to first dependence symptom. The effects of age and moderating  effects of gender were also examined. Data were from a longitudinal study of  children of alcoholics and matched controls (N = 454) followed from late  childhood to midlife. Generally, stage-specific hypotheses were not supported;  rather, greater internalizing symptoms predicted an earlier age of first drink  and a faster transition through the full interval from first drink to first  dependence symptom. Regarding gender moderation, internalizing significantly  predicted a faster transition between each milestone as well as through the full  interval among women but not men.

Telzer EH(1), Miernicki ME(2), Rudolph KD(2).	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. (2)University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.	Although behavioral and experimental studies have shown links between  victimization and antisocial behavior, the neural correlates explaining this  link are relatively unknown. In the current study, we recruited adolescent girls  from a longitudinal study that tracked youths' reports of peer victimization  experiences annually from the second through eighth grades. Based on these  reports, 46 adolescents were recruited: 25 chronically victimized and 21  nonvictimized. During a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, participants  completed a risk-taking task. Chronic peer victimization was associated with  greater risk-taking behavior during the task and higher levels of self-reported  antisocial behavior in everyday life. At the neural level, chronically  victimized girls showed greater activation in regions involved in affective  sensitivity, social cognition, and cognitive control, which significantly  mediated victimization group differences in self-reported antisocial behavior.

Adolescent cannabis use, change in neurocognitive function, and high-school  graduation: A longitudinal study from early adolescence to young adulthood.

(3)Centre de recherche du CHU Ste.-Justine.	The main objective of this prospective longitudinal study was to investigate  bidirectional associations between adolescent cannabis use (CU) and  neurocognitive performance in a community sample of 294 young men from ages 13  to 20 years. The results showed that in early adolescence, and prior to  initiation to CU, poor short-term and working memory, but high verbal IQ, were  associated with earlier age of onset of CU. In turn, age of CU onset and CU  frequency across adolescence were associated with (a) specific neurocognitive  decline in verbal IQ and executive function tasks tapping trial and error  learning and reward processing by early adulthood and (b) lower rates of  high-school graduation. The association between CU onset and change in  neurocognitive function, however, was found to be accounted for by CU frequency.  Whereas the link between CU frequency across adolescence and change in verbal IQ  was explained (mediated) by high school graduation, the link between CU  frequency and tasks tapping trial and error learning were independent from high  school graduation, concurrent cannabis and other substance use, adolescent  alcohol use, and externalizing behaviors. Findings support prevention efforts  aimed at delaying onset and reducing frequency of CU.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416001280 PMCID: PMC5403347 PMID: 28031069 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Schofield TJ(1), Conger RD(2), Conger KJ(2).	Author information: (1)Iowa State University. (2)University of California-Davis.	Harsh, abusive, and rejecting behavior by parents toward their children is  associated with increased risk for many developmental problems for youth.  Children raised by harsh parents are also more likely to treat their own  children harshly. The present study addresses conditions that would break this  intergenerational cycle of harsh parenting. Data come from a three-generation  study of a cohort of 290 adolescents (Generation 2 [G2], 52% female) grown to  adulthood and their parents (Generation 1 [G1]). During adolescence, observers  rated G1 harsh parenting to G2. Several years later observers rated G2 harsh  parenting toward their oldest child (Generation 3 [G3]). Several adaptive  systems fundamental to human resilience attenuate intergenerational continuity  in harshness. G2 parents were relatively less harsh to G3 children  (notwithstanding a history of harshness from G1) when G2's romantic partner (a)  communicated positively with G2 and (b) had a good relationship with G3, and (c)  when G2 was high on self-control. Interventions that target all of these  protective factors may not only break but also reverse the intergenerational  cycle of child maltreatment.

Children's exposure to violent political conflict stimulates aggression at peers  by increasing emotional distress, aggressive script rehearsal, and normative  beliefs favoring aggression.

We examine the hypothesis that children's exposure to ethnic-political conflict  and violence over the course of a year stimulates their increased aggression  toward their own in-group peers in subsequent years. In addition, we examine  what social cognitive and emotional processes mediate these effects and how  these effects are moderated by gender, age, and ethnic group. To accomplish  these aims, we collected three waves of data from 901 Israeli and 600  Palestinian youths (three age cohorts: 8, 11, and 14 years old) and their  parents at 1-year intervals. Exposure to ethnic-political violence was  correlated with aggression at in-group peers among all age cohorts. Using a  cross-lagged structural equation model from Year 1 to Year 3, we found that the  relation between exposure and aggression is more plausibly due to exposure to  ethnic-political violence stimulating later aggression at peers than vice versa,  and this effect was not moderated significantly by gender, age cohort, or ethnic  group. Using three-wave structural equation models, we then showed that this  effect was significantly mediated by changes in normative beliefs about  aggression, aggressive script rehearsal, and emotional distress produced by the  exposure. Again the best fitting model did not allow for moderation by gender,  age cohort, or ethnic group. The findings are consistent with recent theorizing  that exposure to violence leads to changes both in emotional processes promoting  aggression and in the acquisition through observational learning of social  cognitions promoting aggression.

Exploring genetic moderators and epigenetic mediators of contextual and family  effects: From Gene × Environment to epigenetics.	Beach SR(1), Brody GH(1), Barton AW(1), Philibert RA(2).	Author information: (1)University of Georgia. (2)University of Iowa.	In the current manuscript, we provide an overview of a research program at the  University of Georgia's Center for Family Research designed to expand upon rapid  and ongoing developments in the fields of genetics and epigenetics. By placing  those developments in the context of translational research on family and  community determinants of health and well-being among rural African Americans,  we hope to identify novel, modifiable environments and biological processes. In  the first section of the article, we review our earlier work on genotypic  variation effects on the association between family context and mental and  physical health outcomes as well as differential responses to family-based  intervention. We then transition to discuss our more recent research on the  association of family and community environments with epigenetic processes. In  this second section of the article, we begin by briefly reviewing terminology  and basic considerations before describing evidence that early environments may  influence epigenetic motifs that potentially serve as mediators of long-term  effects of early family and community environments on longer term health  outcomes. We also provide evidence that genotype may sometimes influence  epigenetic outcomes. Finally, we describe our recent efforts to use genome-wide  characterization of epigenetic patterns to better understand the biological  impact of protective parenting on long-term shifts in inflammatory processes and  its potential implications for young adult health. As will be clear, research on  epigenetics as a mediator of the connections between family/community processes  and a range of health outcomes is still in its infancy, but the potential to  develop important insights regarding mechanisms linking modifiable environments  to biological processes and long-term health outcomes already is coming into  view.

Author information: (1)University of Georgia.	For the past quarter century, scientists at the Center for Family Research at  the University of Georgia have conducted research designed to promote  understanding of normative developmental trajectories among low socioeconomic  status African American children, youths, and young adults. In this paper, we  describe a recent expansion of this research program using longitudinal,  epidemiological studies and randomized prevention trials to test hypotheses  about the origins of disease among rural African American youths. The  contributions of economic hardship, downward mobility, neighborhood poverty, and  racial discrimination to allostatic load and epigenetic aging are illustrated.  The health benefits of supportive family relationships in protecting youths from  these challenges are also illustrated. A cautionary set of studies is presented  showing that some psychosocially resilient youths demonstrate high allostatic  loads and accelerated epigenetic aging, suggesting that, for some, "resilience  is just skin deep." Finally, we end on an optimistic note by demonstrating that  family-centered prevention programs can have health benefits by reducing  inflammation, helping to preserve telomere length, and inhibiting epigenetic  aging.

Studies in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans suggest that epigenetic  processes mediate between early life experiences and adult phenotype. However,  the normal evolution of epigenetic programs during child development, the effect  of sex, and the impact of early life adversity on these trajectories are not  well understood. This study mapped the genome-wide DNA methylation changes in  CD3+ T lymphocytes from rhesus monkeys from postnatal day 14 through 2 years of  age in both males and females and determined the impact of maternal deprivation  on the DNA methylation profile. We show here that DNA methylation profiles  evolve from birth to adolescence and are sex dependent. DNA methylation changes  accompany imposed weaning, attenuating the difference between males and females.  Maternal separation at birth alters the normal evolution of DNA methylation  profiles and targets genes that are also affected by a later stage maternal  separation, that is, weaning. Our results suggest that early life events  dynamically interfere with the normal developmental evolution of the DNA  methylation profile and that these changes are highly effected by sex.

Few studies have investigated developmental strengths and weaknesses within the  cognitive profile of children and adolescents with fragile X syndrome (FXS), a  single-gene cause of inherited intellectual impairment. With a prospective  longitudinal design and using normalized raw scores (Z scores) to circumvent  floor effects, we measured cognitive functioning of 184 children and adolescents  with FXS (ages 6 to 16) using the Wechsler Scale of Intelligence for Children on  one to three occasions for each participant. Participants with FXS received  lower raw scores relative to the Wechsler Scale of Intelligence for Children  normative sample across the developmental period. Verbal comprehension,  perceptual organization, and processing speed Z scores were marked by a widening  gap from the normative sample, while freedom from distractibility Z scores  showed a narrowing gap. Key findings include a relative strength for verbal  skills in comparison with visuospatial-constructive skills arising in  adolescence and a discrepancy between working memory (weakness) and processing  speed (strength) in childhood that diminishes in adolescence. Results suggest  that the cognitive profile associated with FXS develops dynamically from  childhood to adolescence. Findings are discussed within the context of aberrant  brain morphology in childhood and maturation in adolescence. We argue that  assessing disorder-specific cognitive developmental profiles will benefit future  disorder-specific treatment research.

Role of temperament in early adolescent pure and co-occurring internalizing and  externalizing problems using a bifactor model: Moderation by parenting and  gender.	Wang FL(1), Eisenberg N(1), Valiente C(1), Spinrad TL(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University.	We contribute to the literature on the relations of temperament to externalizing  and internalizing problems by considering parental emotional expressivity and  child gender as moderators of such relations and examining prediction of pure  and co-occurring problem behaviors during early to middle adolescence using  bifactor models (which provide unique and continuous factors for pure and  co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems). Parents and teachers  reported on children's (4.5- to 8-year-olds; N = 214) and early adolescents' (6  years later; N = 168) effortful control, impulsivity, anger, sadness, and  problem behaviors. Parental emotional expressivity was measured observationally  and with parents' self-reports. Early-adolescents' pure externalizing and  co-occurring problems shared childhood and/or early-adolescent risk factors of  low effortful control, high impulsivity, and high anger. Lower childhood and  early-adolescent impulsivity and higher early-adolescent sadness predicted  early-adolescents' pure internalizing. Childhood positive parental emotional  expressivity more consistently related to early-adolescents' lower pure  externalizing compared to co-occurring problems and pure internalizing. Lower  effortful control predicted changes in externalizing (pure and co-occurring)  over 6 years, but only when parental positive expressivity was low. Higher  impulsivity predicted co-occurring problems only for boys. Findings highlight  the probable complex developmental pathways to adolescent pure and co-occurring  externalizing and internalizing problems.

Risk and protective factors for comorbid internalizing and externalizing  problems among economically disadvantaged African American youth.	Liu J(1), Mustanski B(2), Dick D(3), Bolland J(4), Kertes DA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Florida. (2)Northwestern University. (3)Virginia Commonwealth University. (4)University of Alabama.	Comorbidity of internalizing and externalizing problems and its risk and  protective factors have not been well incorporated into developmental research,  especially among racial minority youth from high-poverty neighborhoods. The  present study identified a latent comorbid factor as well as specific factors  underlying internalizing and externalizing problems among 592 African American  adolescents living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods (291 male; M age  = 15.9 years, SD = 1.43 years). Stressful life events and racial discrimination  were associated with higher comorbid problems, whereas stressful life events and  exposure to violence were associated with higher specific externalizing  problems. Collective efficacy was associated with both lower specific  externalizing problems and lower comorbid problems. Moreover, high collective  efficacy buffered the risk effects of stressful life events and racial  discrimination on comorbid problems. Our results demonstrated the advantages of  latent variable modeling to understanding comorbidity by articulating impacts of  risk factors on comorbid and specific components underlying internalizing and  externalizing problems. They also highlighted the protective effect of  collective efficacy in mitigating risks for these problems. These findings  broadly call for more studies on comorbidities in developmental psychopathology  among youth from diverse sociocultural backgrounds.

Neural substrates of trait impulsivity, anhedonia, and irritability: Mechanisms  of heterotypic comorbidity between externalizing disorders and unipolar  depression.	Zisner A(1), Beauchaine TP(1).	Author information: (1)The Ohio State University.	Trait impulsivity, which is often defined as a strong preference for immediate  over delayed rewards and results in behaviors that are socially inappropriate,  maladaptive, and short-sighted, is a predisposing vulnerability to all  externalizing spectrum disorders. In contrast, anhedonia is characterized by  chronically low motivation and reduced capacity to experience pleasure, and is  common to depressive disorders. Although externalizing and depressive disorders  have virtually nonoverlapping diagnostic criteria in the fifth edition of the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, heterotypic comorbidity  between them is common. Here, we review common neural substrates of trait  impulsivity, anhedonia, and irritability, which include both low tonic  mesolimbic dopamine activity and low phasic mesolimbic dopamine responding to  incentives during reward anticipation and associative learning. We also consider  how other neural networks, including bottom-up emotion generation systems and  top-down emotion regulation systems, interact with mesolimbic dysfunction to  result in alternative manifestations of psychiatric illness. Finally, we present  a model that emphasizes a translational, transdiagnostic approach to  understanding externalizing/depression comorbidity. This model should refine  ways in which internalizing and externalizing disorders are studied, classified,  and treated.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416000754 PMID: 27739396 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism moderates the continuity of  behavioral inhibition in early childhood.	Johnson VC(1), Kryski KR(1), Sheikh HI(1), Smith HJ(1), Singh SM(1), Hayden  EP(1).	Author information: (1)University of Western Ontario.	Persistently elevated behavioral inhibition (BI) in children is a marker of  vulnerability to psychopathology. However, little research has considered the  joint influences of caregiver and child factors that may moderate the continuity  of BI in early childhood, particularly genetic variants that may serve as  markers of biological plasticity, such as the serotonin transporter linked  polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). We explored this issue in 371 preschoolers and  their caregivers, examining whether parent characteristics (i.e.,  overinvolvement or anxiety disorder) and child 5-HTTLPR influenced the  continuity of BI between ages 3 and 5. Measures were observational ratings of  child BI, observational and questionnaire measures of parenting, and parent  interviews for anxiety disorder history, and children were genotyped for the  5-HTTLPR. Parent factors did not moderate the association between age 3 and age  5 BI; however, child BI at age 3 interacted with children's 5-HTTLPR variants to  predict age 5 BI, such that children with at least one copy of the short allele  exhibited less continuity of BI over time relative to children without this  putative plasticity variant. Findings are consistent with previous work  indicating the 5-HTTLPR short variant increases plasticity to contextual  influences, thereby serving to decrease the continuity of BI in early childhood.

McNaughton N(1), Corr PJ(2).	Author information: (1)University of Otago. (2)City University London.	We discuss comorbidity, continuity, and discontinuity of anxiety-related  disorders from the perspective of a two-dimensional neuropsychology of fear  (threat avoidance) and anxiety (threat approach). Pharmacological dissection of  the "neurotic" disorders justifies both a categorical division between fear and  anxiety and a subdivision of each mapped to a hierarchy of neural modules that  process different immediacies of threat. It is critical that each module can  generate normal responses, symptoms of another syndrome, or syndromal responses.  We discuss the resultant possibilities for comorbid dysfunction of these modules  both with each other and with some disorders not usually classified as anxiety  related. The simplest case is symptomatic fear/anxiety comorbidity, where  dysfunction in one module results in excess activity in a second, otherwise  normal, module to generate symptoms and apparent comorbidity. More complex is  syndromal fear/anxiety comorbidity, where more than one module is concurrently  dysfunctional. Yet more complex are syndromal comorbidities of anxiety that go  beyond the two dimensional fear/anxiety systems: depression, substance use  disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Our account of  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-anxiety comorbidity entails discussion  of the neuropsychology of externalizing disorders to account for the lack of  anxiety comorbidity in some of these. Finally, we link the neuropsychology of  disorder to personality variation, and to the development of a biomarker of  variation in the anxiety system among individuals that, if extreme, may provide  a means of unambiguously identifying the first of a range of anxiety syndromes.

Pathways from neurocognitive vulnerability to co-occurring internalizing and  externalizing problems among women with and without  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder followed prospectively for 16 years.	Owens EB(1), Hinshaw SP(1).	Author information: (1)University of California,Berkeley.	Using a sample of 228 females with and without childhood  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder followed prospectively across 16 years,  we measured childhood neurocognitive vulnerability via executive dysfunction  using teacher-reported cognitive and learning problems. We then ascertained  relations between dimensionally measured internalizing and externalizing  psychopathology during adulthood and showed that childhood neurocognitive  vulnerability reliably predicted such associated psychopathology. We identified  six serial mediation pathways from childhood neurocognitive vulnerability to  adult psychopathology through three early- and late-adolescent domains:  individual (self-control and delay of gratification), peer (rejection/conflict  and acceptance/friendship), and school (academic performance and school  failure). The serial indirect effects occurred for the pathways from childhood  neurocognitive vulnerability through early-adolescent academic performance, to  late-adolescent school failure, to adult associated psychopathology, and from  neurocognitive vulnerability through adolescent self-control and then the  ability to delay gratification, to adult psychopathology. Furthermore, these  indirect effects, plus two others, were moderated by parental distress during  childhood and early adolescence, such that under conditions of high distress,  the serial indirect effects were weaker than when parental distress was low. We  discuss the potential importance of behavioral self-regulation and educational  success for later psychological functioning, especially among girls, as well as  implications for ontogenic process models of psychopathology.

Emotion regulation as a transdiagnostic factor in the development of  internalizing and externalizing psychopathology: Current and future directions.	Aldao A(1), Gee DG(2), De Los Reyes A(3), Seager I(1).	Author information: (1)Ohio State University. (2)Yale University. (3)University of Maryland at College Park.	In response to rapidly growing rates of comorbidity among psychiatric disorders,  clinical scientists have become interested in identifying transdiagnostic  processes that can help explain dysfunction across diagnostic categories (e.g.,  Kring & Sloan, 2009). One factor that has received a great deal of attention is  that of emotion regulation, namely, the ability to modulate the intensity and/or  duration of emotional states (e.g., Cicchetti, Ackerman, & Izard, 1995; Gross,  1998). Recent theoretical and empirical work has begun to emphasize the role  that emotion regulation plays in the temporal comorbidity between internalizing  and externalizing conditions (e.g., Aldao & De Los Reyes, 2015; De Los Reyes &  Aldao, 2015; Drabick & Kendall, 2010; Jarrett & Ollendick, 2008; Patrick &  Hajcak, 2016). However, close inspection of this work reveals two very pertinent  areas of growth: (a) this literature is characterized by mixed findings that are  likely explained, in part, by methodological heterogeneity; and (b) emotion  regulation tends to be studied in relatively narrow terms. To address these  issues, we provide a series of recommendations for facilitating cross-study  comparisons and leveraging multifaceted approaches to studying emotion  regulation processes within a developmental psychopathology framework. We hope  that our perspective can enhance the organization and growth of this very  important area of inquiry, and ultimately result in more effective prevention  and treatment programs.

Beyond comorbidity: Toward a dimensional and hierarchical approach to  understanding psychopathology across the life span.	Forbes MK(1), Tackett JL(2), Markon KE(3), Krueger RF(1).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota. (2)Northwestern University. (3)University of Iowa City.	We propose a novel developmentally informed framework to push research beyond a  focus on comorbidity between discrete diagnostic categories and to move toward  research based on the well-validated dimensional and hierarchical structure of  psychopathology. For example, a large body of research speaks to the validity  and utility of the internalizing and externalizing spectra as organizing  constructs for research on common forms of psychopathology. The internalizing  and externalizing spectra act as powerful explanatory variables that channel the  psychopathological effects of genetic and environmental risk factors, predict  adaptive functioning, and account for the likelihood of disorder-level  manifestations of psychopathology. As such, our proposed theoretical framework  uses the internalizing and externalizing spectra as central constructs to guide  future psychopathology research across the life span. The framework is  particularly flexible, because any of the facets or factors from the dimensional  and hierarchical structure of psychopathology can form the focus of research. We  describe the utility and strengths of this framework for developmental  psychopathology in particular and explore avenues for future research.

Infant autonomic nervous system response and recovery: Associations with  maternal risk status and infant emotion regulation.	Suurland J(1), van der Heijden KB(1), Smaling HJA(1), Huijbregts SCJ(1), van  Goozen SHM(1), Swaab H(1).	Author information: (1)Leiden University.	This study examined whether risk status and cumulative risk were associated with  autonomic nervous system reactivity and recovery, and emotion regulation in  infants. The sample included 121 6-month-old infants. Classification of risk  status was based on World Health Organization criteria (e.g., presence of  maternal psychopathology, substance use, and social adversity). Heart rate,  parasympathetic respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and sympathetic preejection period  were examined at baseline and across the still face paradigm. Infant emotion  regulation was coded during the still face paradigm. Infants in the high-risk  group showed increased heart rate, parasympathetic withdrawal, and sympathetic  activation during recovery from the still face episode. Higher levels of  cumulative risk were associated with increased sympathetic nervous system  activation. Moreover, increased heart rate during recovery in the high-risk  group was mediated by both parasympathetic and sympathetic activity, indicating  mobilization of sympathetic resources when confronted with socioemotional  challenge. Distinct indirect pathways were observed from maternal risk to infant  emotion regulation during the still face paradigm through parasympathetic and  sympathetic regulation. These findings underline the importance of specific  measures of parasympathetic and sympathetic response and recovery, and indicate  that maternal risk is associated with maladaptive regulation of stress early in  life reflecting increased risk for later psychopathology.

Family instability and children's effortful control in the context of poverty:  Sometimes a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.	Sturge-Apple ML(1), Davies PT(1), Cicchetti D(2), Hentges RF(1), Coe JL(1).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester. (2)Mt. Hope Family Center.	Effortful control has been demonstrated to have important ramifications for  children's self-regulation and social-emotional adjustment. However, there are  wide socioeconomic disparities in children's effortful control, with  impoverished children displaying heightened difficulties. The current study was  designed to demonstrate how instability within the proximal rearing context of  young children may serve as a key operant on the development of children's  effortful control in the context of poverty. Two separate studies were conducted  that included samples of children living within homes characterized by  heightened economic risk. In Study 1, we tested the differential prediction of  family instability on two domains of children's effortful control: cool  effortful control and delay control. Consistent with hypotheses, elevated  instability was associated with decreased hot effortful control but not cool  effortful control over the span of 2 years. In Study 2, we examined how  children's basal cortisol activity may account for associations between  heightened instability and effortful control in reward tasks. The results were  consistent with sensitization models, suggesting that elevated cortisol activity  arising from increased uncertainty and unpredictability in rearing contexts may  influence children's hot effortful control. The findings are interpreted within  emerging evolutionary-developmental frameworks of child development.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416000407 PMID: 27580955 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Transactional effects among maternal depression, neighborhood deprivation, and  child conduct problems from early childhood through adolescence: A tale of two  low-income samples.	Shaw DS(1), Sitnick SL(1), Reuben J(1), Dishion TJ(2), Wilson MN(3).	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh. (2)Arizona State University. (3)University of Virginia.	The current study sought to advance our understanding of transactional processes  among maternal depression, neighborhood deprivation, and child conduct problems  (CP) using two samples of low-income families assessed repeatedly from early  childhood to early adolescence. After accounting for initial levels of negative  parenting, independent and reciprocal effects between maternal depressive  symptoms and child CP were evident across both samples, beginning in early  childhood and continuing through middle childhood and adolescence. In addition,  neighborhood effects were consistently found in both samples after children  reached age 5, with earlier neighborhood effects on child CP and maternal  depression found in the one exclusively urban sample of families with male  children. The results confirm prior research on the independent contribution of  maternal depression and child CP to the maintenance of both problem behaviors.  The findings also have implications for designing preventative and clinical  interventions to address child CP for families living in high-risk  neighborhoods.

Author information: (1)University of Minnesota.	The development of adult personality disorder symptoms, including transactional  processes of relationship representational and behavioral experience from  infancy to early adolescence, was examined using longitudinal data from a risk  sample (N = 162). Significant preliminary correlations were found between early  caregiving experience and adult personality disorder symptoms and between  representational and behavioral indices across time and adult symptomatology.  Significant correlations were also found among diverse representational  assessments (e.g., interview, drawing, and projective narrative) and between  concurrent representational and observational measures of relationship  functioning. Path models were analyzed to investigate the combined relations of  caregiving experience in infancy; relationship representation and experience in  early childhood, middle childhood, and early adolescence; and personality  disorder symptoms in adulthood. The hypothesized model representing interactive  contributions of representational and behavioral experience represented the data  significantly better than competing models representing noninteractive  contributions. Representational and behavioral indicators mediated the link  between early caregiving quality and personality disorder symptoms. The findings  extend previous studies of normative development and support an organizational  developmental view that early relationship experiences contribute to  socioemotional maladaptation as well as adaptation through the progressive  transaction of mutually informing expectations and experience.

Kretschmer T(1), Veenstra R(1), Deković M(2), Oldehinkel AJ(3).	Author information: (1)University of Groningen. (2)Utrecht University. (3)University Medical Centre Groningen.	In contrast to victimization, prior research on the antecedents and outcomes of  bullying perpetration has provided little conclusive knowledge. Some adolescent  bullies may be well adjusted and popular among peers, while other bullies are  rejected and lack self-control. There is also great variation in the outcomes,  with a number of studies (but not all) showing increased risk for externalizing  and internalizing problems. We used a developmental framework and data from  2,230 participants of the Dutch Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey  (TRAILS) to examine bullying perpetration across adolescence, to test the links  with various antecedents in preadolescence, and to elucidate the outcomes in  early adulthood. Latent growth models indicated significant variance in initial  bullying perpetration levels and an overall decrease between pre- and late  adolescence. Individual, family, and peer factors were associated with initial  levels and partially associated with bullying development over time. Bullying  perpetration was linked to later maladjustment and substance use, although only  in girls. Finally, bullying perpetration appears to function as an intermediate  variable between preadolescent individual, family, and peer risk and substance  use more than 10 years later. These results have important implications for  understanding the gender-specific nature of bullying perpetration and its  outcomes and for demonstrating that bullying carries early risk into adulthood.

Extremely low birth weight babies grown up: Gene-environment interaction  predicts internalizing problems in the third and fourth decades of life.	Lahat A(1), van Lieshout RJ(1), Mathewson KJ(1), Mackillop J(1), Saigal S(1),  Morrison KM(1), Boyle MH(1), Schmidt LA(1).	Author information: (1)McMaster University.	Extremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1000 g) infants have been exposed to  stressful intrauterine and early postnatal environments. Even greater early  adversity has been experienced by ELBW survivors who were also born small for  gestational age (SGA; <10th percentile for GA) compared to those born  appropriate for GA (AGA). ELBW survivors, particularly those born SGA, face  increased risk for internalizing problems compared to normal BW (NBW; ≥2500 g)  controls. Internalizing problems are related to allelic variations in the  promoter region of the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region gene  (5-HTTLPR). We followed the oldest longitudinal cohort of ELBW survivors to  adulthood. Participants provided buccal cells and reported on internalizing  problems, using the Young Adult Self-Report when they were in their mid-20s  (ELBW/SGA, N = 28; ELBW/AGA, N = 60; NBW, N = 81) and mid-30s (ELBW/SGA, N = 27;  ELBW/AGA, N = 58; NBW, N = 76). The findings indicate that ELBW/SGAs carrying  the 5-HTTLPR short allele reported increased internalizing problems,  particularly depression, during the third and fourth decades of life. This is  the first known report on gene-environment interactions predicting  psychopathology among ELBW survivors. Our findings elucidate putative  neurobiological pathways that underlie risk for psychopathology.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416000511 PMID: 27416920 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Parsing apart the persisters: Etiological mechanisms and criminal offense  patterns of moderate- and high-level persistent offenders.	Amemiya J(1), Vanderhei S(1), Monahan KC(1).	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh.	Longitudinal investigations that have applied Moffitt's dual taxonomic framework  to criminal offending have provided support for the existence of  adolescent-limited and life-course persistent antisocial individuals, but have  also identified additional trajectories. For instance, rather than a single  persistent trajectory, studies have found both high-level and moderate-level  persistent offenders. To inform theory and progress our understanding of chronic  antisocial behavior, the present study used a sample of serious adolescent  offenders (N =1,088) followed from middle adolescence to early adulthood (14-25  years), and examined how moderate-level persistent offenders differed from  low-rate, desisting, and high-level persistent offenders. Results indicated that  moderate-level persisters' etiology and criminal offense patterns were most  similar to high-level persisters, but there were notable differences.  Specifically, increasing levels of contextual adversity characterized both  moderate-level and high-level persisting trajectories, but moderate-level  persisters reported consistently lower levels of environmental risk. While both  high- and moderate-level persisters committed more drug-related offenses in  early adulthood compared to adolescence, moderate-level persisters engaged in  lower levels of antisocial behavior across all types of criminal offenses. Taken  cumulatively, the findings of this study suggest that sociocontextual  interventions may be powerful in reducing both moderate- and high-level  persistence in crime.

Trajectories of marijuana use from late childhood to late adolescence: Can  Temperament × Experience interactions discriminate different trajectories of  marijuana use?	Scalco MD(1), Colder CR(1).	Author information: (1)State University of New York at Buffalo.	Informed by developmental ecological and epigenetic theory, the current study  examined three aims concerning adolescent marijuana use with a large community  sample (N = 755; gender = 53% female) and six annual assessments that spanned  11-18 years of age. First, the natural history of adolescent marijuana use was  modeled using a two-part latent growth curve analysis. Second, the validity of  the mixtures was examined with a broad array of known correlates of adolescent  marijuana use. Third, temperament (e.g., surgency, effortful control, and  negative affect) was tested as individual differences that would enter into  statistical interactions with peer substance use and prior alcohol and cigarette  use to distinguish trajectories of marijuana use. The results suggested that  escalations in marijuana use were observed for some youth who initiated  marijuana use early in adolescence. Youth whose marijuana use did escalate  substantially (10%) were distinguished on temperament, conduct disorder, peer  delinquency, and pubertal development at baseline. Furthermore, hypothesized  interactions between surgency and both peer substance use and prior substance  use discriminated different patterns of marijuana use. The findings are  discussed with respect to strategies for timing and content of preventive  interventions.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416000468 PMCID: PMC5299053 PMID: 27322037 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)University of Vermont College of Medicine. (2)McGill University. (3)Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine.	There are multiple recent reports of an association between anxious/depressed  (A/D) symptomatology and the rate of cerebral cortical thickness maturation in  typically developing youths. We investigated the degree to which  anxious/depressed symptoms are tied to age-related microstructural changes in  cerebral fiber pathways. The participants were part of the NIH MRI Study of  Normal Brain Development. Child Behavior Checklist A/D scores and diffusion  imaging were available for 175 youths (84 males, 91 females; 241 magnetic  resonance imagings) at up to three visits. The participants ranged from 5.7 to  18.4 years of age at the time of the scan. Alignment of fractional anisotropy  data was implemented using FSL/Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, and linear mixed  model regression was carried out using SPSS. Child Behavior Checklist A/D was  associated with the rate of microstructural development in several white matter  pathways, including the bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral  inferior longitudinal fasciculus, left superior longitudinal fasciculus, and  right cingulum. Across these pathways, greater age-related fractional anisotropy  increases were observed at lower levels of A/D. The results suggest that  subclinical A/D symptoms are associated with the rate of microstructural  development within several white matter pathways that have been implicated in  affect regulation, as well as mood and anxiety psychopathology.

Longitudinal prediction of language emergence in infants at high and low risk  for autism spectrum disorder.	Edmunds SR(1), Ibañez LV(1), Warren Z(2), Messinger DS(3), Stone WL(1).	Author information: (1)University of Washington. (2)Vanderbilt University. (3)University of Miami.	This study used a prospective longitudinal design to examine the early  developmental pathways that underlie language growth in infants at high risk (n  = 50) and low risk (n = 34) for autism spectrum disorder in the first 18 months  of life. While motor imitation and responding to joint attention (RJA) have both  been found to predict expressive language in children with autism spectrum  disorder and those with typical development, the longitudinal relation between  these capacities has not yet been identified. As hypothesized, results revealed  that 15-month RJA mediated the association between 12-month motor imitation and  18-month expressive vocabulary, even after controlling for earlier levels of RJA  and vocabulary. These results provide new information about the developmental  sequencing of skills relevant to language growth that may inform future  intervention efforts for children at risk for language delay or other  developmental challenges.

Maternal physiological dysregulation while parenting poses risk for infant  attachment disorganization and behavior problems.	Leerkes EM(1), Su J(1), Calkins SD(1), O'Brien M(1), Supple AJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Greensboro.	The extent to which indices of maternal physiological arousal (skin conductance  augmentation) and regulation (vagal withdrawal) while parenting predict infant  attachment disorganization and behavior problems directly or indirectly via  maternal sensitivity was examined in a sample of 259 mothers and their infants.  Two covariates, maternal self-reported emotional risk and Adult Attachment  Interview attachment coherence were assessed prenatally. Mothers' physiological  arousal and regulation were measured during parenting tasks when infants were 6  months old. Maternal sensitivity was observed during distress-eliciting tasks  when infants were 6 and 14 months old, and an average sensitivity score was  calculated. Attachment disorganization was observed during the Strange Situation  when infants were 14 months old, and mothers reported on infants' behavior  problems when infants were 27 months old. Over and above covariates, mothers'  arousal and regulation while parenting interacted to predict infant attachment  disorganization and behavior problems such that maternal arousal was associated  with higher attachment disorganization and behavior problems when maternal  regulation was low but not when maternal regulation was high. This effect was  direct and not explained by maternal sensitivity. The results suggest that  maternal physiological dysregulation while parenting places infants at risk for  psychopathology.

The co-occurring development of internalizing and externalizing problems were  examined in an inception cohort of 392 children diagnosed with autism spectrum  disorder at age 3 who were assessed on four occasions. Results indicated that  internalizing and externalizing problems were stable over time and highly  comorbid. Joint trajectory analysis suggested that 13% of the sample followed a  dual high-risk trajectory. High risk was not found to be associated with  intellectual ability or autism spectrum disorder symptom severity but was linked  to lower income and gender: more girls than boys were found in the high/stable  internalizing problems trajectory. The results suggest that 1 in 4 preschoolers  followed a trajectory of internalizing or externalizing problems (or a  combination of the two) that could be characterized as clinically elevated.

A total of 149 children, who spent an average of 13.8 months in Russian  institutions, were transferred to Russian families of relatives and nonrelatives  at an average age of 24.7 months. After residing in these families for at least  1 year (average = 43.2 months), parents reported on their attachment,  indiscriminately friendly behavior, social-emotional competencies, problem  behaviors, and effortful control when they were 1.5-10.7 years of age. They were  compared to a sample of 83 Russian parents of noninstitutionalized children,  whom they had reared from birth. Generally, institutionalized children were  rated similarly to parent-reared children on most measures, consistent with  substantial catch-up growth typically displayed by children after transitioning  to families. However, institutionalized children were rated more poorly than  parent-reared children on certain competencies in early childhood and some  attentional skills. There were relatively few systematic differences associated  with age at family placement or whether the families were relatives or  nonrelatives. Russian parent-reared children were rated as having more problem  behaviors than the US standardization sample, which raises cautions about using  standards cross-culturally.

Peng CZ(1), Grant JD(1), Heath AC(1), Reiersen AM(1), Mulligan RC(1), Anokhin  AP(1).	Author information: (1)Washington University School of Medicine.	To investigate familial influences on the full range of variability in attention  and activity across adolescence, we collected maternal ratings of 339 twin pairs  at ages 12, 14, and 16, and estimated the transmitted and new familial  influences on attention and activity as measured by the Strengths and Weaknesses  of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms and Normal Behavior Scale.  Familial influences were substantial for both traits across adolescence: genetic  influences accounted for 54%-73% (attention) and 31%-73% (activity) of the total  variance, and shared environmental influences accounted for 0%-22% of the  attention variance and 13%-57% of the activity variance. The longitudinal  stability of individual differences in attention and activity was largely  accounted for by familial influences transmitted from previous ages. Innovations  over adolescence were also partially attributable to familial influences.  Studying the full range of variability in attention and activity may facilitate  our understanding of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder's etiology and  intervention.

Author information: (1)Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.	Longitudinal research on mental health development beyond adolescence among  nonclinical populations is lacking. This study reports on psychiatric disorder  trajectories from late adolescence to young adulthood in relation to childhood  and adolescent risk factors. Participants were recruited for a prospective  longitudinal study tracing a community sample of 5-year-old children with  communication disorders and a matched control cohort to age 31. Psychiatric  disorders were measured at ages 19, 25, and 31. Known predictors of  psychopathology and two school-related factors specifically associated with  language disorder (LD) were measured by self-reports and semistructured  interviews. The LD cohort was uniquely characterized by a significantly  decreasing disorder trajectory in early adulthood. Special education was  associated with differential disorder trajectories between LD and control  cohorts, whereas maltreatment history, specific learning disorder, family  structure, and maternal psychological distress were associated with consistent  trajectories between cohorts. From late adolescence to young adulthood,  childhood LD was characterized by a developmentally limited course of  psychiatric disorder; maltreatment was consistently characterized by an elevated  risk of psychiatric disorder regardless of LD history, whereas special education  was associated with significantly decreasing risk of psychiatric disorder only  in the presence of LD.

Victor EC(1), Hariri AR(1).	Author information: (1)Duke University.	Late adolescence and emerging adulthood (specifically ages 15-24) represent a  period of heightened sexual risk taking resulting in the greatest annual rates  of sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies in the US  population. Ongoing efforts to prevent such negative consequences are likely to  benefit from a deepening of our understanding of biological mechanisms through  which sexual risk taking emerges and biases decision making during this critical  window. Here we present a neuroscience framework from which a mechanistic  examination of sexual risk taking can be advanced. Specifically, we adapt the  neurodevelopmental triadic model, which outlines how motivated behavior is  governed by three systems: approach, avoidance, and regulation, to sexual  decision making and subsequent risk behavior. We further propose a testable  hypothesis of the triadic model, wherein relatively decreased threat-related  amygdala reactivity and increased reward-related ventral striatum reactivity  leads to sexual risk taking, which is particularly exaggerated during  adolescence and young adulthood when there is an overexpression of dopaminergic  neurons coupled with immature top-down prefrontal cortex regulation. We conclude  by discussing how future research based on our adapted triadic model can inform  ongoing efforts to improve intervention and prevention efforts.

Mechanisms of change: Testing how preventative interventions impact  psychological and physiological stress functioning in mothers in neglectful  families.	Toth SL(1), Sturge-Apple ML(1), Rogosch FA(1), Cicchetti D(1).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	The present study applies a multilevel approach to an examination of the effect  of two randomized preventive interventions with mothers in neglectful families  who are also contending with elevated levels of impoverishment and ecological  risk. Specifically, we examined how participation in either child-parent  psychotherapy (CPP) or psychoeducational parenting intervention (PPI) was  associated with reductions in maternal psychological parenting stress and in  turn physiological stress system functioning when compared to mothers involved  in standard community services as well as a demographic comparison group of  nonmaltreating mothers. The resulting group sizes in the current investigation  were 44 for CPP, 34 for PPI, 27 for community services, and 52 for  nonmaltreating mothers. Mothers and their 13-month-old infants were randomly  assigned to intervention group at baseline. Mothers completed assessments on  stress within the parenting role at baseline and postintervention. Basal  cortisol was sampled at postintervention and 1-year follow-up. Latent difference  score analyses examined change in these constructs over time. Results suggested  that mothers within the CPP intervention experienced significant declines in  child-related parenting stress, while mothers in the PPI intervention reported  declines in parent-related parenting stress. In turn, significant decreases in  stress within the CPP mothers were further associated with adaptive basal  cortisol functioning at 1-year postintervention. The results highlight the value  of delineating how participation in preventive interventions aimed at  ameliorating child maltreatment in neglectful families within the context of  poverty may operate through improvements in psychological and physiological  stress functioning. Findings are discussed with respect to the importance of  multilevel assessments of intervention process and outcome.

Dishion TJ(1), Mun CJ(1), Drake EC(1), Tein JY(1), Shaw DS(2), Wilson M(3).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University. (2)University of Pittsburgh. (3)University of Virginia.	This study examined the hypothesis that a brief, strengths-based home visiting  strategy can promote positive engagement between caregiver and child and thereby  reduce various forms of early childhood neglect. A total of 731 low-income  families receiving services through the Women, Infants, and Children nutritional  supplement program were randomized to the Women, Infants, and Children as usual  or the Family Check-Up intervention. Assessments and intervention services were  delivered in the home environment at ages 2, 3, 4, and 5. During the  assessments, staff videotaped caregiver-child interactions and rated various  features of the home environment, including the physical appropriateness of the  home setting for children. Trained observers later coded the videotapes, unaware  of the family's intervention condition. Specific caregiver-child interaction  patterns were coded and macroratings were made of the caregiver's affection,  monitoring, and involvement with the child. An intention to treat design  revealed that randomization to the Family Check-Up increased duration of  positive engagement between caregivers and children by age 3, which in turn was  prognostic of less neglect of the child at age 4, controlling for family  adversity. It was also found that family adversity moderated the impact of the  intervention, such that the families with the most adverse circumstances were  highly responsive to the intervention. Families with the highest levels of  adversity exhibited the strongest mediation between positive engagement and  reduction of neglect. Findings are discussed with respect to developmental  theory and their potential implications for a public health approach to the  prevention of early childhood maltreatment.

Sex differences in socioemotional functioning, attentional bias, and gray matter  volume in maltreated children: A multilevel investigation.

While maltreatment is known to impact social and emotional functioning, threat  processing, and neural structure, the potentially dimorphic influence of sex on  these outcomes remains relatively understudied. We investigated sex differences  across these domains in a large community sample of children aged 10 to 14 years  (n = 122) comprising 62 children with verified maltreatment experience and 60  well-matched nonmaltreated peers. The maltreated group relative to the  nonmaltreated comparison group exhibited poorer social and emotional functioning  (more peer problems and heightened emotional reactivity). Cognitively, they  displayed a pattern of attentional avoidance of threat in a visual dot-probe  task. Similar patterns were observed in males and females in these domains.  Reduced gray matter volume was found to characterize the maltreated group in the  medial orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal lobes, and bilateral  supramarginal gyrus; sex differences were observed only in the supramarginal  gyrus. In addition, a disordinal interaction between maltreatment exposure and  sex was found in the postcentral gyrus. Finally, attentional avoidance to threat  mediated the relationship between maltreatment and emotional reactivity, and  medial orbitofrontal cortex gray matter volume mediated the relationship between  maltreatment and peer functioning. Similar mediation patterns were observed  across sexes. This study highlights the utility of combining multiple levels of  analysis when studying the "latent vulnerability" engendered by childhood  maltreatment and yields tentative findings regarding a neural basis of sex  differences in long-term outcomes for maltreated children.

Childhood maltreatment is a serious individual, familial, and societal threat  that compromises healthy development and is associated with lasting alterations  to emotion perception, processing, and regulation (Cicchetti & Curtis, 2005;  Pollak, Cicchetti, Hornung, & Reed, 2000; Pollak & Tolley-Schell, 2003).  Individuals with a history of maltreatment show altered structural and  functional brain development in both frontal and limbic structures (Hart &  Rubia, 2012). In particular, previous research has identified hyperactive  amygdala responsivity associated with childhood maltreatment (e.g., Dannlowski  et al., 2012). However, less is known about the impact of maltreatment on the  relationship between the amygdala and other brain regions. The present study  employed an emotion processing functional magnetic resonance imaging task to  examine task-based activation and functional connectivity in adults who  experienced maltreatment as children. The sample included adults with a history  of substantiated childhood maltreatment (n = 33) and comparison adults (n = 38)  who were well matched on demographic variables, all of whom have been studied  prospectively since childhood. The maltreated group exhibited greater activation  than comparison participants in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. In  addition, maltreated adults showed increased amygdala connectivity with the  hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The results suggest that the intense early  stress of childhood maltreatment is associated with lasting alterations to  frontolimbic circuitry.

Author information: (1)Duke University School of Medicine.	Magnetic resonance imaging studies of maltreated children with posttraumatic  stress disorder (PTSD) suggest that maltreatment-related PTSD is associated with  adverse brain development. Maltreated youth resilient to chronic PTSD were not  previously investigated and may elucidate neuromechanisms of the stress  diathesis that leads to resilience to chronic PTSD. In this cross-sectional  study, anatomical volumetric and corpus callosum diffusion tensor imaging  measures were examined using magnetic resonance imaging in maltreated youth with  chronic PTSD (N = 38), without PTSD (N = 35), and nonmaltreated participants (n  = 59). Groups were sociodemographically similar. Participants underwent  assessments for strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and psychopathology.  Maltreated youth with PTSD were psychobiologically different from maltreated  youth without PTSD and nonmaltreated controls. Maltreated youth with PTSD had  smaller posterior cerebral and cerebellar gray matter volumes than did  maltreated youth without PTSD and nonmaltreated participants. Cerebral and  cerebellar gray matter volumes inversely correlated with PTSD symptoms.  Posterior corpus callosum microstructure in pediatric maltreatment-related PTSD  differed compared to maltreated youth without PTSD and controls. The group  differences remained significant when controlling for psychopathology, numbers  of Axis I disorders, and trauma load. Alterations of these posterior brain  structures may result from a shared trauma-related mechanism or an inherent  vulnerability that mediates the pathway from chronic PTSD to comorbidity.

Symptoms of major depressive disorder subsequent to child maltreatment:  Examining change across multiple levels of analysis to identify transdiagnostic  risk pathways.	Shenk CE(1), Griffin AM(1), O'Donnell KJ(2).	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University. (2)McGill University.	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition in the  child maltreatment population. However, not all children who have been  maltreated will develop MDD or MDD symptoms, suggesting the presence of unique  risk pathways that explain how certain children develop MDD symptoms when others  do not. The current study tested several candidate risk pathways to MDD symptoms  following child maltreatment: neuroendocrine, autonomic, affective, and emotion  regulation. Female adolescents (N = 110; age range = 14-19) were recruited into  a substantiated child maltreatment or comparison condition and completed a  laboratory stressor, saliva samples, and measures of emotion regulation,  negative affect, and MDD symptoms. MDD symptoms were reassessed 18 months later.  Mediational modeling revealed that emotion regulation was the only significant  indirect effect of the relationship between child maltreatment and subsequent  MDD symptoms, demonstrating that children exposed to maltreatment had greater  difficulties managing affective states that in turn led to more severe MDD  symptoms. These results highlight the importance of emotion dysregulation as a  central risk pathway to MDD following child maltreatment. Areas of future  research and implications for optimizing prevention and clinical intervention  through the direct targeting of transdiagnostic risk pathways are discussed.

Several neurological variables have been investigated as premorbid biomarkers of  vulnerability for schizophrenia and other related disorders. The current study  examined whether childhood dyspraxia predicted later adult  nonaffective-psychosis-spectrum disorders. From a standardized neurological  examination performed with children (aged 10-13) at genetic high risk of  schizophrenia and controls, several measures of dyspraxia were used to create a  scale composed of face/head dyspraxia, oral articulation, ideomotor dyspraxia  (clumsiness), and dressing dyspraxia (n = 244). Multinomial logistic regression  showed higher scores on the dyspraxia scale predict  nonaffective-psychosis-spectrum disorders relative to other psychiatric  disorders and no mental illness outcomes, even after controlling for genetic  risk, χ2 (4, 244) = 18.61, p < .001. Findings that symptoms of dyspraxia in  childhood (reflecting abnormalities spanning functionally distinct brain  networks) specifically predict adult nonaffective-psychosis-spectrum disorders  are consistent with a theory of abnormal connectivity, and they highlight a  marked early-stage vulnerability in the pathophysiology of  nonaffective-psychosis-spectrum disorders.

Identifying early pathways of risk and resilience: The codevelopment of  internalizing and externalizing symptoms and the role of harsh parenting.	Wiggins JL(1), Mitchell C(1), Hyde LW(1), Monk CS(1).	Author information: (1)University of Michigan.	Psychological disorders co-occur often in children, but little has been done to  document the types of conjoint pathways internalizing and externalizing symptoms  may take from the crucial early period of toddlerhood or how harsh parenting may  overlap with early symptom codevelopment. To examine symptom codevelopment  trajectories, we identified latent classes of individuals based on internalizing  and externalizing symptoms across ages 3-9 and found three symptom codevelopment  classes: normative symptoms (low), severe-decreasing symptoms (initially high  but rapidly declining), and severe symptoms (high) trajectories. Next, joint  models examined how parenting trajectories overlapped with internalizing and  externalizing symptom trajectories. These trajectory classes demonstrated that,  normatively, harsh parenting increased after toddlerhood, but the severe  symptoms class was characterized by a higher level and a steeper increase in  harsh parenting and the severe-decreasing class by high, stable harsh parenting.  In addition, a transactional model examined the bidirectional relationships  among internalizing and externalizing symptoms and harsh parenting because they  may cascade over time in this early period. Harsh parenting uniquely contributed  to externalizing symptoms, controlling for internalizing symptoms, but not vice  versa. In addition, internalizing symptoms appeared to be a mechanism by which  externalizing symptoms increase. Results highlight the importance of accounting  for both internalizing and externalizing symptoms from an early age to  understand risk for developing psychopathology and the role harsh parenting  plays in influencing these trajectories.

Barnett MA(1), Scaramella LV(2).	Author information: (1)University of Arizona. (2)University of New Orleans.	Reduced supportive parenting and elevated negative parenting behaviors increase  risks for maladaptive social adjustment during early childhood (e.g., Campbell,  Shaw, & Gilliom, 2000). However, the magnitude of these risks may vary according  to children's individual characteristics, such as sex and temperament. The  current study examines whether children's sex and fear reactivity moderate the  associations between mothers' observed parenting and children's behavior  problems 1 year later. The sample consists of 151 predominantly African  American, low-income families with one sibling who is approximately 2 years old  and the closest aged older sibling who is approximately 4 years old. Results  from fixed-effects within-family models indicate that fear distress (i.e.,  fearfulness) moderated associations between mothers' observed negative parenting  and children's increased behavior problems, such that only those children with  mean or higher observed fear distress scores showed increased behavior problems  when exposed to mother's negative parenting. Child sex moderated associations  between fear approach reactivity (i.e., fearlessness) and mothers' observed  supportive parenting. Specifically, low fear approach combined with supportive  parenting was associated with fewer behavior problems for boys only.  Implications of these findings for preventive intervention are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415000759 PMID: 26439069 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Munster University.	Evidence for the risks of psychopathic personality traits for adolescent  antisocial behavior are well documented in the literature. Little is known,  however, about who the peers of adolescents with these traits are and to what  extent they influence one another. In the current study, three dimensions of  psychopathic traits were distinguished: grandiose-manipulative traits,  callous-unemotional traits, and impulsive-irresponsible traits. A dynamic social  network approach was used with three waves of longitudinal data from 1,772  adolescents (51.1% girls, M age = 13.03 at first measurement). Results showed  that adolescents with grandiose-manipulative and callous-unemotional traits  formed peer relationships with adolescents who had low self-esteem. Furthermore,  peers' violence predicted stronger increases in violence for adolescents with  low self-esteem than for other adolescents, and peers' violence predicted  stronger increases in adolescent violence for peers with high psychopathic  traits than for other peers. Thus, findings indicate that adolescents with low  self-esteem are vulnerable to deviant peer influence from peers with  psychopathic traits.

The contribution of change over time in parent and child characteristics to  parents' resolution of child's diagnosis was examined among 78 mothers and  fathers of children with autism spectrum disorder. Children's characteristics  (e.g., mental age and severity of symptoms), parental characteristics (e.g.,  attachment-related anxiety and stress level), and parents' resolution of their  child's diagnosis (resolved vs. unresolved) were examined at Time 1, and  reassessed 3 years later at Time 2. Results indicated a deferential contribution  of change in parent and child characteristics among mothers and fathers. An  increase in child symptom severity and in maternal attachment-related anxiety,  as well as longer durations of time since receiving the diagnosis, significantly  predicted maternal resolved status at Time 2. Conversely, none of the changes in  children's or paternal characteristics predicted paternal resolved status at  Time 2. Results are discussed in relation to child and parental contributions to  resolution, the differences in the adjustment and well-being of mothers and  fathers of children with autism spectrum disorder, parental growth following  receiving the diagnosis, and the need for intervention components specific to  parental resolution and attachment-related anxiety.

Parent and youth dopamine D4 receptor genotypes moderate multilevel contextual  effects on rural African American youth's risk behavior.	Cho J(1), Kogan SM(1).	Author information: (1)University of Georgia.	The present investigation extends research on Gene × Environment interactions  and youth risk behavior by linking multilevel contextual factors, such as  community disadvantage and protective parenting practices, to both parental and  youth dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) genotypes. We expected community disadvantage  to influence youth risk behavior via a series of indirect effects involving  protective parenting and youth's planful future orientation when both parents'  and youth's DRD4 status was considered. Genetic moderation processes also were  tested to determine whether they conformed to a diathesis-stress or a  differential susceptibility model. Hypotheses were investigated with data from  361 rural African American youth and their parents assessed 3 times when youth  were ages 16 to 19. Community disadvantage interacted with parental DRD4 status  to predict low levels of protective parenting. Protective parenting, in turn,  interacted with youth DRD4 status to forecast increases in youth's planful  future orientations, a proximal influence on changes in risk behavior. The  Parental DRD4 × Community Disadvantage interaction, but not youth DRD4 ×  Protective Parenting, conformed to a differential susceptibility model. Indirect  effect analyses revealed a significant indirect path linking community  disadvantage to youth risk behavior through a series of multilevel Gene ×  Environment interaction processes.

Neighborhood × Serotonin Transporter Linked Polymorphic Region (5-HTTLPR)  interactions for substance use from ages 10 to 24 years using a harmonized data  set of African American children.

This study investigated the influences of neighborhood factors (residential  stability and neighborhood disadvantage) and variants of the serotonin  transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genotype on the development of  substance use among African American children aged 10-24 years. To accomplish  this, a harmonized data set of five longitudinal studies was created via pooling  overlapping age cohorts to establish a database with 2,689 children and 12,474  data points to span ages 10-24 years. A description of steps used in the  development of the harmonized data set is provided, including how issues such as  the measurement equivalence of constructs were addressed. A sequence of  multilevel models was specified to evaluate Gene × Environment effects on growth  of substance use across time. Findings indicated that residential instability  was associated with higher levels and a steeper gradient of growth in substance  use across time. The inclusion of the 5-HTTLPR genotype provided greater  precision to the relationships in that higher residential instability, in  conjunction with the risk variant of 5-HTTLPR (i.e., the short allele), was  associated with the highest level and steepest gradient of growth in substance  use across ages 10-24 years. The findings demonstrated how the creation of a  harmonized data set increased statistical power to test Gene × Environment  interactions for an under studied sample.

Lotzin A(1), Schiborr J(1), Barkmann C(1), Romer G(1), Ramsauer B(1).	Author information: (1)University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf.	A heightened synchrony between the mother's and infant's facial affect predicts  adverse infant development. We know that maternal psychopathology is related to  mother-infant facial affect synchrony, but it is unclear how maternal  psychopathology is transmitted to mother-infant synchrony. One pathway might be  maternal emotion dysregulation. We examined (a) whether maternal emotion  dysregulation is positively related to facial affect synchrony and (b) whether  maternal emotion dysregulation mediates the effect of maternal psychopathology  on mother-infant facial affect synchrony. We observed 68 mothers with mood  disorders and their 4- to 9-month-old infants in the Still-Face paradigm during  two play interactions. The mother's and infant's facial affect were rated from  high negative to high positive, and the degree of synchrony between the mother's  and infant's facial affect was computed with a time-series analysis. Emotion  dysregulation was measured with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale,  and psychopathology was assessed with the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. Higher  maternal emotion dysregulation was significantly associated with higher facial  affect synchrony; emotion dysregulation fully mediated the effect of maternal  psychopathology on facial affect synchrony. Our findings demonstrate that  maternal emotion dysregulation rather than maternal psychopathology per se  places mothers and infants at risk for heightened facial affect synchrony.

Genetic moderation of the association between adolescent romantic involvement  and depression: Contributions of serotonin transporter gene polymorphism,  chronic stress, and family discord.	Starr LR(1), Hammen C(2).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester. (2)University of California,Los Angeles.	Studies support a link between adolescent romantic involvement and depression.  Adolescent romantic relationships may increase depression risk by introducing  chronic stress, and genetic vulnerability to stress reactivity/emotion  dysregulation may moderate these associations. We tested genetic moderation of  longitudinal associations between adolescent romantic involvement and later  depressive symptoms by a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter linked  polymorphic region gene (5-HTTLPR) and examined contributory roles of chronic  stress and family discord. Three hundred eighty-one youth participated at ages  15 and 20. The results indicated that 5-HTTLPR moderated the association between  age 15 romantic involvement and age 20 depressive symptoms, with strongest  effects for short homozygotes. Conditional process analysis revealed that  chronic stress functioned as a moderated mediator of this association, fully  accounting for the romantic involvement-depression link among short/short  genotypes. Also, romantic involvement predicted later depressive symptoms most  strongly among short-allele carriers with high family discord. The results have  important implications for understanding the romantic involvement-depression  link and the behavioral and emotional correlates of the 5-HTTLPR genotype.

Differential susceptibility to environmental influences: Interactions between  child temperament and parenting in adolescent alcohol use.	Rioux C(1), Castellanos-Ryan N(1), Parent S(1), Vitaro F(1), Tremblay RE(1),  Séguin JR(1).	Author information: (1)Université de Montréal.	Temperament and parental practices (PP) are important predictors of adolescent  alcohol use (AU); however, less is known about how they combine to increase or  decrease risk of AU. This study examined whether age 6 temperament (i.e.,  impulsivity and inhibitory control) interacted with age 6 coercive PP and/or age  14 parental monitoring to predict AU at 15 years among 209 adolescents. Results  showed that low parental monitoring was associated with more frequent AU and  that coercive PP interacted with impulsivity to predict AU. This interaction was  examined as a function of two models that were not studied before in the  prediction of AU: the diathesis-stress model (i.e., impulsive children are more  "vulnerable" to adverse PP than those with an easy temperament); and the  differential susceptibility model (i.e., impulsive children are also more likely  to benefit from good PP). Results supported the differential susceptibility  model by showing that impulsive children were not only at higher risk for AU  when combined with high coercive PP but also benefit from the absence of  coercive PP. This supports the suggestion that the conception of certain  temperament characteristics, or in this case impulsivity, as a "vulnerability"  for adolescent AU, may need revision because it misrepresents the malleability  it may imply.

(4)University of Cambridge.	Much research has examined Moffitt's developmental taxonomy, focusing almost  exclusively on the distinction between life-course persistent and  adolescence-limited offenders. Of interest, a handful of studies have identified  a group of individuals whose early childhood years were marked by extensive  antisocial behavior but who seemed to recover and desist (at least from severe  offending) in adolescence and early adulthood. We use data from the Cambridge  Study in Delinquent Development to examine the adult adjustment outcomes of  different groups of offenders, including a recoveries group, in late middle  adulthood, offering the most comprehensive investigation of this particular  group to date. Findings indicate that abstainers comprise the largest group of  males followed by adolescence-limited offenders, recoveries, and life-course  persistent offenders. Furthermore, the results reveal that a host of adult  adjustment problems measured at ages 32 and 48 in a number of life-course  domains are differentially distributed across these four offender groups. In  addition, the recoveries and life-course persistent offenders often show the  greatest number of adult adjustment problems relative to the adolescence-limited  offenders and abstainers.

Keshavan MS(1), Mehta UM(1), Padmanabhan JL(1), Shah JL(2).	Author information: (1)Harvard Medical School. (2)McGill University.	In this paper, we review the history of the concept of neuroplasticity as it  relates to the understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders, using schizophrenia  as a case in point. We briefly review the myriad meanings of the term  neuroplasticity, and its neuroscientific basis. We then review the evidence for  aberrant neuroplasticity and metaplasticity associated with schizophrenia as  well as the risk for developing this illness, and discuss the implications of  such understanding for prevention and therapeutic interventions. We argue that  the failure and/or altered timing of plasticity of critical brain circuits might  underlie cognitive and deficit symptoms, and may also lead to aberrant plastic  reorganization in other circuits, leading to affective dysregulation and  eventually psychosis. This "dysplastic" model of schizophrenia can suggest  testable etiology and treatment-relevant questions for the future.

Animal studies and a growing body of  literature in humans have shown that early adversity is linked to methylation of  the gene for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is a key regulator of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as well as a broad range of physiological  systems including metabolic and immune function. One hundred eighty-four  families participated, including n = 74 with child welfare documentation of  moderate-severe maltreatment in the past 6 months. Children ranged in age from 3  to 5 years, and were racially and ethnically diverse. Structured record review  and interviews in the home were used to assess a history of maltreatment, other  traumas, and contextual life stressors, and a composite variable assessed the  number exposures to these adversities. Methylation of regions 1(D), 1(F), and  1(H) of the GR gene was measured via sodium bisulfite pyrosequencing. The  composite measure of adversity was positively correlated with methylation at  exons 1(D) and 1(F) in the promoter of the GR gene. Individual stress measures  were significantly associated with a several CpG sites in these regions. GR gene  methylation may be a mechanism of the biobehavioral effects of adverse exposures  in young children.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415000176 PMCID: PMC5014375 PMID: 25997773 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Childhood maltreatment has lasting negative effects throughout the life span.  Early intervention research has demonstrated that these effects can be  remediated through skill-based, family-centered interventions. However, less is  known about plasticity during adolescence, and whether interventions are  effective many years after children experience maltreatment. This study  investigated this question by examining adolescent girls' ability to make  advantageous decisions in the face of risk using a validated decision-making  task; performance on this task has been associated with key neural regions  involved in affective processing and executive functioning. Maltreated foster  girls (n = 92), randomly assigned at age 11 to either an intervention designed  to prevent risk-taking behaviors or services as usual (SAU), and nonmaltreated  age and socioeconomic status matched girls living with their biological  parent(s) (n = 80) completed a decision-making task (at age 15-17) that assessed  risk taking and sensitivity to expected value, an index of advantageous decision  making. Girls in the SAU condition demonstrated the greatest decision-making  difficulties, primarily for risks to avoid losses. In the SAU group, frequency  of neglect was related to greater difficulties in this area. Girls in the  intervention condition with less neglect performed similarly to nonmaltreated  peers. This research suggests that early maltreatment may impact decision-making  abilities into adolescence and that enriched environments during early  adolescence provide a window of plasticity that may ameliorate these negative  effects.

Swingler MM(1), Perry NB(1), Calkins SD(1).	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Greensboro.	The development of attention has been strongly linked to the regulation of  emotion and behavior and has therefore been of particular interest to  researchers aiming to better understand precursors to behavioral maladjustment.  In the current paper, we utilize a developmental psychopathology and neural  plasticity framework to highlight the importance of both intrinsic (i.e., infant  neural functioning) and extrinsic (i.e., caregiver behavior) factors for the  development of attentional control across the first year. We begin by  highlighting the importance of attention for children's emotion regulation  abilities and mental health. We then review the development of attention  behavior and underscore the importance of neural development and caregiver  behavior for shaping attentional control. Finally, we posit that neural  activation associated with the development of the executive attention network  may be one mechanism through which maternal caregiving behavior influences the  development of infants' attentional control and subsequent emotion regulation  abilities known to be influential to childhood psychopathology.

Building upon the transactional model of brain development, we explore the  impact of early maternal deprivation on neural development and plasticity in  three neural systems: hyperactivity/impulsivity, executive function, and  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning across rodent, nonhuman primate,  and human studies. Recognizing the complexity of early maternal-infant  interactions, we limit our cross-species comparisons to data from rodent models  of artificial rearing, nonhuman primate studies of peer rearing, and the  relations between these two experimental approaches and human studies of  children exposed to the early severe psychosocial deprivation associated with  institutional care. In addition to discussing the strengths and limitations of  these paradigms, we present the current state of research on the neurobiological  impact of early maternal deprivation and the evidence of sensitive periods,  noting methodological challenges. Integrating data across preclinical animal  models and human studies, we speculate about the underlying biological  mechanisms; the differential impact of deprivation due to temporal factors  including onset, offset, and duration of the exposure; and the possibility and  consequences of reopening of sensitive periods during adolescence.

Cognitive impulsivity and the development of delinquency from late childhood to  early adulthood: Moderating effects of parenting behavior and peer  relationships.	Menting B(1), Van Lier PA(1), Koot HM(1), Pardini D(2), Loeber R(2).	Author information: (1)VU University Amsterdam. (2)University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.	Cognitive impulsivity may increase children's risk of developing delinquent  behavior. However, the influence of cognitive impulsivity may depend on social  environmental risk factors. This study examined the moderating effect of late  childhood parenting behaviors and peer relations on the influence of children's  cognitive impulsivity on delinquency development across adolescence and early  adulthood, while taking possible interactions with intelligence also into  account. Delinquent behavior of 412 boys from the Pittsburgh Youth Study was  measured annually from ages 13 to 29 years with official arrest records.  Cognitive impulsivity (neurocognitive test scores) and intelligence were  assessed at age 12-13. Parenting behaviors (persistence of discipline, positive  reinforcement, and parental knowledge), peer delinquency, and peer conventional  activities were assessed between ages 10 and 13 years. Results showed that,  while controlling for intelligence, the influence of youths' cognitive  impulsivity on delinquency depended on their parents' behaviors. An interaction  was found among cognitive impulsivity, intelligence, and peer delinquency, but  instead of cognitive impulsivity, the effect of intelligence on delinquency was  particularly moderated. Overall, findings suggest that when there was  moderation, high cognitive impulsivity and low intelligence were associated with  an increased probability for engaging in delinquency predominantly among boys in  a good social environment, but not in a poor social environment.

Variation in serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR)  short/long genotype modulates resting frontal electroencephalography asymmetries  in children.

(4)Maastricht University.	Previous studies have documented the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic  region (5-HTTLPR) as a genetic susceptibility variant that contributes to  variability in outcomes related to affective psychopathology, with the short  allele associated with negative affectivity and the long allele associated with  positive affectivity. In a separate but related line of research, extensive  evidence suggests that frontal electroencephalography (EEG) hemispheric  asymmetry in the alpha band is also associated with risk for affective  psychopathologies, with leftward asymmetry associated with approach-related  behavior patterns and rightward frontal EEG asymmetry associated with withdrawn  behavioral tendencies. We examined frontal EEG hemispheric asymmetries in  relation to 5-HTTLPR genotyping in 70 children between 4 and 6 years of age.  Analyses revealed that frontal EEG lateralization interacted with genotype such  that children homozygous for the short allele exhibited rightward frontal EEG  asymmetries, children who were homozygous for the long allele consistently  exhibited a positive pattern of leftward asymmetry, and heterozygotes exhibited  equivalent left and right frontal activity. These findings suggest that the  5-HTTLPR short allele may provide a degree of susceptibility for later affective  psychopathology in adolescence and adulthood, through mediation of frontal brain  activity that is associated with cognitive-behavioral withdrawal tendencies and  negative affectivity.

Predicting childhood effortful control from interactions between early parenting  quality and children's dopamine transporter gene haplotypes.	Li Y(1), Sulik MJ(1), Eisenberg N(1), Spinrad TL(1), Lemery-Chalfant K(1),  Stover DA(1), Verrelli BC(2).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University. (2)Virginia Commonwealth University.	Children's observed effortful control (EC) at 30, 42, and 54 months (n = 145)  was predicted from the interaction between mothers' observed parenting with  their 30-month-olds and three variants of the solute carrier family C6, member 3  (SLC6A3) dopamine transporter gene (single nucleotide polymorphisms in intron8  and intron13, and a 40 base pair variable number tandem repeat [VNTR] in the  3'-untranslated region [UTR]), as well as haplotypes of these variants.  Significant moderating effects were found. Children without the  intron8-A/intron13-G, intron8-A/3'-UTR VNTR-10, or intron13-G/3'-UTR VNTR-10  haplotypes (i.e., haplotypes associated with the reduced SLC6A3 gene expression  and thus lower dopamine functioning) appeared to demonstrate altered levels of  EC as a function of maternal parenting quality, whereas children with these  haplotypes demonstrated a similar EC level regardless of the parenting quality.  Children with these haplotypes demonstrated a trade-off, such that they showed  higher EC, relative to their counterparts without these haplotypes, when exposed  to less supportive maternal parenting. The findings revealed a diathesis-stress  pattern and suggested that different SLC6A3 haplotypes, but not single variants,  might represent different levels of young children's sensitivity/responsivity to  early parenting.

We examined whether maltreatment experienced in childhood and/or adolescence  prospectively predicts young adult functioning in a diverse and  well-characterized sample of females with childhood-diagnosed  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (N = 140). Participants were part of a  longitudinal study and carefully evaluated in childhood, adolescence, and young  adulthood (M age = 9.6, 14.3, and 19.7 years, respectively), with high retention  rates across time. A thorough review of multisource data reliably established  maltreatment status for each participant (M κ = 0.78). Thirty-two (22.9%)  participants experienced at least one maltreatment type (physical abuse, sexual  abuse, or neglect). Criterion variables included a broad array of young adult  measures of functioning gleaned from multiple-source, multiple-informant  instruments. With stringent statistical control of demographic, prenatal, and  family status characteristics as well as baseline levels of the criterion  variable in question, maltreated participants were significantly more impaired  than nonmaltreated participants with respect to self-harm (suicide attempts),  internalizing symptomatology (anxiety and depression), eating disorder  symptomatology, and well-being (lower overall self-worth). Effect sizes were  medium. Comprising the first longitudinal evidence linking maltreatment with key  young adult life impairments among a carefully diagnosed and followed sample of  females with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, these findings underscore  the clinical importance of trauma experiences within this population.

Brody GH(1), Yu T(1), Beach SR(1).	Author information: (1)University of Georgia.	This study was designed to investigate a genetic moderation effect of dopamine  receptor 4 gene (DRD4) alleles that have seven or more repeats (long alleles) on  an intervention to deter drug use among rural African American adolescents in  high-risk families. Adolescents (N = 291, M age = 17) were assigned randomly to  the Adults in the Making (AIM) program or to a control condition and were  followed for 27.5 months. Adolescents provided data on drug use and  vulnerability cognitions three times after pretest. Pretest assessments of  caregiver depressive symptoms, disruption in the home, and support toward the  adolescent were used to construct a family risk index. Adolescents living in  high-risk families who carried at least one DRD4 long allele and were assigned  to the control condition evinced greater escalations in drug use than did (a)  adolescents who lived in high-risk families, carried the DRD4 long allele, and  were assigned to AIM, or (b) adolescents assigned to either condition who  carried no DRD4 long alleles. AIM-induced reductions in vulnerability cognitions  were responsible for the Family Risk × AIM × DRD4 status drug use prevention  effects. These findings support differential susceptibility predictions and  imply that prevention effects on genetically susceptible individuals may be  underestimated.

Cicchetti D(1), Toth SL(2), Handley ED(2).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development. (2)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	Genetic moderation of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) efficacy for  economically disadvantaged women with major depressive disorder was examined.  Specifically, we investigated whether genotypic variation in corticotropin  releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) and the linked polymorphic region of the  serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) moderated effects of IPT on depressive  symptoms over time. We also tested genotype moderation of IPT mechanisms on  social adjustment and perceived stress. Non-treatment-seeking urban women at or  below the poverty level with infants were recruited from the community (N = 126;  M age = 25.33 years, SD = 4.99; 54.0% African American, 22.2% Caucasian, and  23.8% Hispanic/biracial) and randomized to individual IPT or Enhanced Community  Standard groups. The results revealed that changes in depressive symptoms over  time depended on both intervention group and genotypes (5-HTTLPR and CRHR1).  Moreover, multiple-group path analysis indicated that IPT improved depressive  symptoms, increased social adjustment, and decreased perceived stress at  posttreatment among women with the 0 copies of the CRHR1 TAT haplotype only.  Finally, improved social adjustment at postintervention significantly mediated  the effect of IPT on reduced depressive symptoms at 8 months postintervention  for women with 0 copies of the TAT haplotype only. Post hoc analyses of 5-HTTLPR  were indicative of differential susceptibility, albeit among African American  women only.

(3)PUCRS University. (4)University of Southampton.	Anxious mothers' parenting, particularly transfer of threat information, has  been considered important in their children's risk for social anxiety disorder  (SAnxD), and maternal narratives concerning potential social threat could  elucidate this contribution. Maternal narratives to their preschool 4- to  5-year-old children, via a picture book about starting school, were assessed in  socially anxious (N = 73), and nonanxious (N = 63) mothers. Child  representations of school were assessed via doll play (DP). After one school  term, mothers (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]) and teachers (Teacher Report  Form) reported on child internalizing problems, and child SAnxD was assessed via  maternal interview. Relations between these variables, infant behavioral  inhibition, and attachment, were examined. Socially anxious mothers showed more  negative (higher threat attribution) and less supportive (lower encouragement)  narratives than controls, and their children's DP representations SAnxD and CBCL  scores were more adverse. High narrative threat predicted child SAnxD; lower  encouragement predicted negative child CBCL scores and, particularly for  behaviorally inhibited children, Teacher Report Form scores and DP  representations. In securely attached children, CBCL scores and risk for SAnxD  were affected by maternal anxiety and threat attributions, respectively. Low  encouragement mediated the effects of maternal anxiety on child DP  representations and CBCL scores. Maternal narratives are affected by social  anxiety and contribute to adverse child outcome.

Author information: (1)University of Illinois,Urbana-Champaign. (2)North Dakota State University. (3)George Washington University. (4)University of California,Riverside.	This research explored sex differences in the pathways linking pubertal timing  to depression across 4 years. A sample of 167 youth (M age = 12.41 years, SD =  1.19) and their caregivers completed measures of puberty and semistructured  interviews of interpersonal stress and youth depression. Youth reported on  psychological (negative self-focus, anxious arousal) and social-behavioral  (coping) characteristics; parents reported on youths' social-behavioral  characteristics (withdrawal/social problems) and deviant peer affiliations.  Early maturation predicted stable high trajectories of depression in girls;  although early maturing boys showed low initial levels of depression, they did  not differ from girls by the final wave of the study. Latent growth curve  analyses identified several psychological, social-behavioral, and interpersonal  pathways accounting for the contribution of pubertal timing to initial and  enduring risk for depression in girls as well as emerging risk for depression in  boys. These findings provide novel insight into multilevel processes accounting  for sex differences in depression across the adolescent transition.

(3)American Institutes of Research. (4)University of Wisconsin,Stout. (5)University of Wisconsin,Madison.	Multilevel models of developmental psychopathology implicate both  characteristics of the individual and their rearing environment in the etiology  of internalizing problems and disorders. Maladaptive regulation of fear and  sadness, the core of anxiety and depression, arises from the conjoint influences  of ineffective parasympathetic regulation of emotion and ineffective emotion  socialization experiences. In 171 youths (84 female, M = 13.69 years, SD =  1.84), we measured changes of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in response to  sadness- and fear-inducing film clips and maternal supportive and punitive  responses to youths' internalizing emotions. Youths and mothers reported on  youths' internalizing problems and anxiety and depression symptoms concurrently  and 2 years later at Time 2. Maternal supportive emotion socialization predicted  fewer, and punitive socialization predicted more, mother-reported internalizing  problems at Time 2 only for youths who showed RSA suppression to fear-inducing  films. More RSA suppression to sadness-inducing films predicted more  youth-reported internalizing problems at Time 2 in girls only. In addition, less  supportive emotion socialization predicted more youth-reported depression  symptoms at Time 2 only for girls who showed more RSA suppression to sadness.  RSA suppression to sadness versus fear might reflect different patterns of  atypical parasympathetic regulation of emotional arousal, both of which increase  the risk for internalizing difficulties in youths, and especially girls, who  lack maternal support for regulating emotions.

Whether internalizing symptoms increase or remain at similar levels throughout  childhood is currently not well understood. Moreover, the association between  vagal regulation of cardiac activity and internalizing symptoms across childhood  needs to be clarified. We used a multilevel conceptual framework to examine how  children's vagal regulation of cardiac activity and mothers' internalizing  symptoms were jointly associated with children's developmental trajectories of  internalizing symptoms from ages 4 to 10 years old. Data came from 384 children  who participated in an ongoing longitudinal study. Children and their mothers  came to the research laboratory at ages 4, 5, 7, and 10. Mothers reported their  children's and their own internalizing symptoms. Children's vagal regulation of  cardiac activity was assessed during quiet baseline tasks and during challenge  tasks. Multilevel models revealed that child internalizing symptoms increased  from ages 4 to 10 years old, but only in females, and especially between ages 7  and 10. More vagal withdrawal in response to challenge was associated with more  internalizing symptoms, particularly with more somatic symptoms. Associations  between children's physiological regulation and internalizing symptoms differed  by children's age, sex, and presence of maternal internalizing symptoms.  Understanding associations between vagal regulation of cardiac activity and  internalizing symptoms during childhood calls for fine-grained developmental  analyses that take into account the heterogeneity of internalizing symptoms, as  well as developmental phase, context, and gender.

Dynamic changes in amygdala activation and functional connectivity in children  and adolescents with anxiety disorders.	Swartz JR(1), Phan KL(1), Angstadt M(1), Fitzgerald KD(1), Monk CS(1).	Author information: (1)University of Michigan,Ann Arbor.	Anxiety disorders are associated with abnormalities in amygdala function and  prefrontal cortex-amygdala connectivity. The majority of functional magnetic  resonance imaging studies have examined mean group differences in amygdala  activation or connectivity in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders  relative to controls, but emerging evidence suggests that abnormalities in  amygdala function are dependent on the timing of the task and may vary across  the course of a scanning session. The goal of the present study was to extend  our knowledge of the dynamics of amygdala dysfunction by examining whether  changes in amygdala activation and connectivity over scanning differ in  pediatric anxiety disorder patients relative to typically developing controls  during an emotion processing task. Examining changes in activation over time  allows for a comparison of how brain function differs during initial exposure to  novel stimuli versus more prolonged exposure. Participants included 34 anxiety  disorder patients and 19 controls 7 to 19 years old. Participants performed an  emotional face-matching task during functional magnetic resonance imaging  scanning, and the task was divided into thirds in order to examine change in  activation over time. Results demonstrated that patients exhibited an abnormal  pattern of amygdala activation characterized by an initially heightened amygdala  response relative to controls at the beginning of scanning, followed by  significant decreases in activation over time. In addition, controls evidenced  greater context-modulated prefrontal cortex-amygdala connectivity during the  beginning of scanning relative to patients. These results indicate that  differences in emotion processing between the groups vary from initial exposure  to novel stimuli relative to more prolonged exposure. Implications are discussed  regarding how this pattern of neural activation may relate to altered  early-occurring or anticipatory emotion-regulation strategies and maladaptive  later-occurring strategies in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders.

Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2016 Nov;28(4pt2):1569-1570.	Here we tested whether there was genetic moderation of effects of early maternal  sensitivity on social-emotional and cognitive-linguistic development from early  childhood onward and whether any detected Gene × Environment interaction effects  proved consistent with differential-susceptibility or diathesis-stress models of  Person × Environment interaction (N = 695). Two new approaches for evaluating  models were employed with 12 candidate genes. Whereas maternal sensitivity  proved to be a consistent predictor of child functioning across the  primary-school years, candidate genes did not show many main effects, nor did  they tend to interact with maternal sensitivity/insensitivity. These findings  suggest that the developmental benefits of early sensitive mothering and the  costs of insensitive mothering look more similar than different across  genetically different children in the current sample. Although acknowledgement  of this result is important, it is equally important that the generally null  Gene × Environment results reported here not be overgeneralized to other  samples, other predictors, other outcomes, and other candidate genes.

The  present study examined pathways to resilience across multiple domains (e.g.,  social activities, peer relations, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  symptomology, externalizing and internalizing behavior, and sleep quality) as  children born preterm reached school age. The study also examined early child  and family predictors of resilience. Using a prospective longitudinal design,  173 infants born preterm and without significant neurological complications were  assessed at five time points: neonatal intensive care unit discharge, 9 months,  16 months, 24 months, and 6 years. Three pathways of adaptation emerged at 6  years: children who were resilient, those who remained at-risk, and children who  exhibited significant difficulties. Resilient children were less likely to have  experienced negative parenting at 9 and 16 months, more likely to delay  gratification at 24 months, and more likely to experience neonatal health  complications than nonresilient children.

Genetic moderation of effects of maternal sensitivity on girl's age of menarche:  Replication of the Manuck et al. study.	Hartman S(1), Widaman KF(1), Belsky J(1).	Author information: (1)University of California,Davis.	Manuck, Craig, Flory, Halder, and Ferrell (2011) reported that a theoretically  anticipated effect of family rearing on girls' menarcheal age was genetically  moderated by two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the estrogen  receptor-α gene. We sought to replicate and extend these findings, studying 210  White females followed from birth. The replication was general because a  different measure of the rearing environment was used in this inquiry (i.e.,  maternal sensitivity) than in the prior one (i.e., family cohesion). Extensions  of the work included prospective rather than retrospective measurements of the  rearing environment, reports of first menstruation within a year of its  occurrence rather than decades later, accounting for some heritability of  menarcheal age by controlling for maternal age of menarche, and using a new  model-fitting approach to competitively compare diathesis-stress versus  differential-susceptibility models of Gene × Environment interaction. The  replication/extension effort proved successful in the case of both estrogen  receptor-α SNPs, with the Gene × Environment interactions principally reflecting  diathesis-stress: lower levels of maternal sensitivity predicted earlier age of  menarche for girls homozygous for the minor alleles of either SNP but not for  girls carrying other genotypes. Results are discussed in light of the new  analytic methods adopted.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414000856 PMID: 25195863 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Carleton University.	This study examined the role of child temperament as moderator of the effect of  parenting style on children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors. A  series of structural equation models were fit to a representative sample of  2,631 Canadian children from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and  Youth. In addition to testing for the presence of Temperament × Parenting  interactions, these models also examined the direct and indirect effects of a  number of additional contextual factors such as neighborhood problems,  neighborhood cohesion, social support, and maternal depression. The results  indicate that exposure to more positive parenting reduces behavior problems in  children with difficult/unadaptable temperaments. No moderating effects of  temperament on hostile parenting were found. Such results serve to highlight the  pivotal role of positive features of the rearing environment as catalysts for  the successful adaptation of children with difficult/unadaptable temperaments.  The results of this modeling work also serve to emphasize the importance of  considering the ways in which more distal factors can affect children's  behavioral adaptation by contributing to changes in proximal family processes.

Developmental interplay between children's biobehavioral risk and the parenting  environment from toddler to early school age: Prediction of socialization  outcomes in preadolescence.	Kochanska G(1), Boldt LJ(1), Kim S(2), Yoon JE(1), Philibert RA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Iowa. (2)Hanyang University.	We followed 100 community families from toddler age to preadolescence. Each  mother- and father-child dyad was observed at 25, 38, 52, 67, and 80 months (10  hr/child) to assess positive and power-assertive parenting. At age 10 (N = 82),  we obtained parent- and child-reported outcome measures of children's acceptance  of parental socialization: cooperation with parental monitoring, negative  attitude toward substance use, internalization of adult values, and  callous-unemotional tendencies. Children who carried a short serotonin  transporter linked polymorphic region gene (5-HTTLPR) allele and were highly  anger prone, based on anger observed in laboratory from 25 to 80 months, were  classified as high in biobehavioral risk. The remaining children were classified  as low in biobehavioral risk. Biobehavioral risk moderated links between  parenting history and outcomes. For low-risk children, parenting measures were  unrelated to outcomes. For children high in biobehavioral risk, variations in  positive parenting predicted cooperation with monitoring and negative attitude  toward substance use, and variations in power-assertive parenting predicted  internalization of adult values and callous-unemotional tendencies. Suboptimal  parenting combined with high biobehavioral risk resulted in the poorest  outcomes. The effect for attitude toward substance use supported differential  susceptibility: children high in biobehavioral risk who received optimal  parenting had a more adaptive outcome than their low-risk peers. The remaining  effects were consistent with diathesis-stress.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414000777 PMCID: PMC4342335 PMID: 25154427 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Borderline personality features as a predictor of forms and functions of  aggression during middle childhood: examining the roles of gender and  physiological reactivity.	Banny AM(1), Tseng WL(2), Murray-Close D(3), Pitula CE(1), Crick NR(1).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota. (2)National Institute of Mental Health. (3)University of Vermont.	The present longitudinal investigation examined borderline personality features  as a predictor of aggression 1 year later. Moderation by physiological  reactivity and gender was also explored. One hundred ninety-six children (M =  10.11 years, SD = 0.64) participated in a laboratory stress protocol in which  their systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and skin conductance  reactivity to recounting a relational stressor (e.g., threats to relationships  or exclusion) were assessed. Teachers provided reports on subtypes of aggressive  behavior (i.e., reactive relational, proactive relational, reactive physical,  and proactive physical), and children completed a self-report measure of  borderline personality features. Path analyses indicated that borderline  personality features predicted increases in reactive relational aggression and  proactive relational aggression among girls who evinced heightened physiological  reactivity to interpersonal stress. In contrast, borderline personality features  predicted decreases in proactive physical aggression in girls. Findings suggest  that borderline personality features promote engagement in relationally  aggressive behaviors among girls, particularly in the context of emotional  dysregulation.

Rudolph KD(1), Troop-Gordon W(2), Monti JD(1), Miernicki ME(1).	Author information: (1)University of Illinois,Urbana-Champaign. (2)North Dakota State University.	Nicki Crick initiated a generative line of theory and research aimed at  exploring the implications of exposure to overt and relational aggression for  youth development. The present study aimed to continue and expand this research  by examining whether early (second grade) and increasing (second-sixth grade)  levels of victimization during elementary school contributed to youths'  tendencies to move against, away from, or toward the world of peers following  the transition to middle school. Youth (M age in second grade = 7.96 years, SD =  0.35; 338 girls, 298 boys) reported on their exposure to victimization and their  social goals (performance-approach, performance-avoidance, or mastery). Teachers  reported on youths' exposure to victimization and their engagement in  antisocial, socially helpless, and prosocial behavior. Latent growth curve  analyses revealed that early and increasing levels of both overt and relational  victimization uniquely contributed to multifinality in adverse developmental  outcomes, predicting all three social orientations (high conflictual engagement,  high disengagement, and low positive engagement). The pattern of effects was  robust across sex and after adjusting for youths' early social motivation. These  findings confirm that both forms of victimization leave an enduring legacy on  youths' social health in adolescence. Given that profiles of moving against and  away from the world can contribute to subsequent psychopathology, understanding  and preventing this legacy is pivotal for developing effective intervention  programs aimed at minimizing the effects of peer adversity.

Cascading effects of interparental conflict in adolescence: Linking threat  appraisals, self-efficacy, and adjustment.	Fosco GM(1), Feinberg ME(1).	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University.	This study examined the longitudinal implications of adolescents' exposure to  interparental conflict for their developmental success. In the proposed  developmental cascade model, adolescents' perceptions of parental conflict as  threatening is a risk factor for diminished self-efficacy, which would account  for diminished adjustment. This study presents longitudinal data for 768  sixth-grade students and their families over four time points, ending in eighth  grade. Analyses were conducted in three steps. First, replication of  longitudinal support for threat as a mediator of the link between interparental  conflict and emotional distress was found; however, findings did not support  threat as a mediator of behavior problems or subjective well-being. Second,  threat was found to mediate the longitudinal association between interparental  conflict and self-efficacy. Third, a developmental cascade model supported a  risk process in which interparental conflict was related to adolescents' threat  appraisals, which undermined self-efficacy beliefs, and was then linked with  emotional distress, behavior problems, and subjective well-being.

Small for gestational age and poor fluid intelligence in childhood predict  externalizing behaviors among young adults born at extremely low birth weight.	Lahat A(1), Van Lieshout RJ(1), Saigal S(1), Boyle MH(1), Schmidt LA(1).	Author information: (1)McMaster University.	Although infants born at extremely low birth weight (ELBW; birth weight < 1000  g) are at increased risk for developing later psychopathology, the mechanisms  contributing to this association are largely unknown. In the present study, we  examined a putative cognitive link to psychopathology in a cohort of ELBW  survivors. These individuals were followed up prospectively at age 8 and again  at ages 22-26. At 8 years, participants completed measures of fluid and general  intelligence. As young adults, a subset of ELBW survivors free of major  neurosensory impairments provided self-reports of personality characteristics  related to psychopathology. Data from 66 participants indicated that, as  predicted, the association between ELBW and externalizing behaviors was  moderated by fluid intelligence. Specifically, ELBW individuals with poor fluid  intelligence who were born small for gestational age (birth weight < 10th  percentile for gestational age) showed the highest level of externalizing  behaviors. These findings provide support for a cumulative risk model and  suggest that fluid intelligence might be a cognitive mechanism contributing to  the development of psychopathology among nonimpaired individuals who were born  at ELBW and small for gestational age.

Social stress and the oxytocin receptor gene interact to predict antisocial  behavior in an at-risk cohort.	Smearman EL(1), Winiarski DA(2), Brennan PA(2), Najman J(3), Johnson KC(4).	Author information: (1)Emory University Rollins School of Public Health. (2)Emory University. (3)University of Queensland. (4)Emory University School of Medicine.	Polymorphisms in the oxytocin receptor gene are commonly associated with  prosocial behaviors in the extant literature, yet their role in antisocial  behaviors has rarely been explored, particularly during the transition from  adolescence to early adulthood. We examined a prospective cohort (N = 404),  collecting youth, mother, and clinician reports of conduct-disordered and  antisocial behavior at ages 15 and 20. The oxytocin receptor gene rs53576  polymorphism was hypothesized to interact with social stress to predict  antisocial outcomes. Structural equation modeling results revealed a significant  main effect at age 15 (p = .025); those with the G allele exhibited higher  levels of conduct problems. Structural equation modeling revealed a significant  Gene × Environment interaction at age 20 (p = .029); those with the G allele who  experienced high social stress exhibited higher levels of antisocial behavior.  Heterozygous (AG) grouping models were compared, and parameter estimations  supported G dominant groupings. These novel findings suggest that rs53576  polymorphisms may influence social salience and contribute to risk for  antisocial outcomes, particularly under conditions of high social stress.

Sensitive periods for the effect of peer victimization on self-cognition:  moderation by age and gender.	Roeder KM(1), Cole DA(1), Sinclair KR(1), Dukewich TL(1), Preacher KJ(1), Felton  JW(1), Jacky A(1), Tilghman-Osborne C(1).	Author information: (1)Vanderbilt University.	The link between the experience of peer victimization (PV) and future  psychological maladjustment has been consistently documented; however, little is  known about intermediary cognitive processes that underlie this relation or how  these processes vary across childhood. The present study examined the  prospective relations between physical and relational PV and the development of  negative and positive automatic thoughts and self-cognitions. Self-reports of  cognitions and peer nomination measures of victimization were obtained from  1,242 children and young adolescents (Grades 3 through 6) in a two-wave  longitudinal study. The results revealed that PV predicted significant increases  in negative views of the self, world, and future and decreases in self-perceived  competence for girls under 11 years of age, with the effect being stronger for  younger girls. PV was not significantly associated with changes in positive or  negative self-cognitions for older girls or for boys of any age. These findings  support the hypothesis that PV may be linked to future psychopathology through  its influence on self-cognitions, but only for girls.

Maternal depression is an established risk factor for child conduct problems,  but relatively few studies have tested whether children's behavioral problems  exacerbate mothers' depression or whether other child behavioral characteristics  (e.g., self-regulation) may mediate bidirectional effects between maternal  depression and child disruptive behavior. This longitudinal study examined the  parallel growth of maternal depressive symptoms and child oppositional behavior  from ages 2 to 5; the magnitude and timing of their bidirectional effects; and  whether child inhibitory control, a temperament-based self-regulatory mechanism,  mediated effects between maternal depression and child oppositionality. A  randomized control trial of 731 at-risk families assessed children annually from  ages 2 to 5. Transactional models demonstrated positive and bidirectional  associations between mothers' depressive symptoms and children's oppositional  behavior from ages 2 to 3, with a less consistent pattern of reciprocal  relations up to age 5. Mediation of indirect mother-child effects and child  evocative effects depended on the rater of children's inhibitory control.  Findings are discussed in regard to how child evocative effects and  self-regulatory mechanisms may clarify the transmission of psychopathology  within families.

Shackman JE(1), Pollak SD(1).	Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin-Madison.	Physically maltreated children are at risk for developing externalizing  behavioral problems characterized by reactive aggression. The current experiment  tested the relationships between individual differences in a neural index of  social information processing, histories of child maltreatment, child negative  affect, and aggressive behavior. Fifty boys (17 maltreated) performed an emotion  recognition task while the P3b component of the event-related potential was  recorded to index attention allocation to angry faces. Children then  participated in a peer-directed aggression task. Negative affect was measured by  recording facial electromyography, and aggression was indexed by the feedback  that children provided to a putative peer. Physically maltreated children  exhibited greater negative affect and more aggressive behavior, compared to  nonmaltreated children, and this relationship was mediated by children's  allocation of attention to angry faces. These data suggest that physical  maltreatment leads to inappropriate regulation of both negative affect and  aggression, which likely place maltreated children at increased risk for the  development and maintenance of externalizing behavior disorders.

A typology of interpartner conflict and maternal parenting practices in  high-risk families: examining spillover and compensatory models and implications  for child adjustment.	Sturge-Apple ML(1), Davies PT(1), Cicchetti D(2), Fittoria MG(2).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester. (2)Mt. Hope Family Center.	The present study incorporates a person-based approach to identify spillover and  compartmentalization patterns of interpartner conflict and maternal parenting  practices in an ethnically diverse sample of 192 2-year-old children and their  mothers who had experienced higher levels of socioeconomic risk. In addition, we  tested whether sociocontextual variables were differentially predictive of  theses profiles and examined how interpartner-parenting profiles were associated  with children's physiological and psychological adjustment over time. As  expected, latent class analyses extracted three primary profiles of functioning:  adequate functioning, spillover, and compartmentalizing families. Furthermore,  interpartner-parenting profiles were differentially associated with both  sociocontextual predictors and children's adjustment trajectories. The findings  highlight the developmental utility of incorporating person-based approaches to  models of interpartner conflict and maternal parenting practices.

Catechol-O-methyltransferase Val158Met genotype moderates the effect of  disorganized attachment on social development in young children.	Hygen BW(1), Guzey IC(1), Belsky J(2), Berg-Nielsen TS(1), Wichstrøm L(1).	Author information: (1)Norwegian University of Science and Technology. (2)University of California-Davis.	Children with histories of disorganized attachment exhibit diverse problems,  possibly because disorganization takes at least two distinctive forms as  children age: controlling-punitive and controlling-caregiving. This variation in  the developmental legacy of disorganization has been attributed primarily to  variations in children's rearing experiences. Here an alternative explanation of  these divergent sequelae of disorganization is evaluated: one focused on  genotype. Structural equation modeling was applied to data on 704 Norwegian  children to test whether the catechol-O-methyltransferase Val158Met genotype  moderates the effect of disorganized attachment, which was measured  dimensionally at 4 years of age using the Manchester Child Attachment Story  Task, on changes in aggressive behavior and social competence from ages 4 to 6.  Children who scored high on disorganization and were homozygous for the valine  allele displayed significantly greater increases in aggression and decreases in  self-oriented social skills (e.g., self-regulation and assertiveness) over time  than did their disorganized counterparts carrying the methionine allele, whereas  disorganized children carrying the methionine allele increased their  other-oriented social skill (e.g., cooperation and responsibility) scores more  than did valine-homozygous children. These results are consistent with the  controlling-punitive and controlling-caregiving behaviors observed in  disorganized children, suggesting that the children's genotype contributed to  variations in the social development of disorganized children.

Williamson KE(1), Jakobson LS(1).	Author information: (1)University of Manitoba.	Children born prematurely at very low birth weight (<1500 g) are at increased  risk for impairments affecting social functioning, including autism spectrum  disorders (e.g., Johnson et al., 2010). In the current study, we used the  Happé-Frith animated triangles task (Abell, Happé, & Frith, 2000) to study  social attribution skills in this population. In this task, typical viewers  attribute intentionality and mental states to shapes, based on characteristics  of their movements. Participants included 34 preterm children and 36 full-term  controls, aged 8-11 years. Groups were comparable in terms of age at test,  gender, handedness, and socioeconomic status; they also performed similarly on  tests of selective attention/processing speed and verbal intelligence. Relative  to full-term peers, preterm children's descriptions of the animations were less  appropriate overall; they also overattributed intentionality/mental states to  randomly moving shapes and underattributed intentionality/mental states to  shapes that seemed to be interacting socially. Impairments in the ability to  infer the putative mental states of triangles from movement cues alone were most  evident in children displaying more "autistic-like" traits, and this may reflect  atypical development of and/or functioning in, or atypical connections between,  parts of the social brain.

Impulsivity, risk taking, and cortisol reactivity as a function of psychosocial  stress and personality in adolescents.	Finy MS(1), Bresin K(1), Korol DL(2), Verona E(1).	Author information: (1)University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. (2)Syracuse University.	Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2014 Nov;26(4 Pt 1):1183.	Although adolescence is characterized by hormonal changes and increased  disinhibited behaviors, explanations for these developmental changes that  include personality and environmental factors have not been fully elucidated. We  examined the interactions between psychosocial stress and the traits of negative  emotionality and constraint on impulsive and risk-taking behaviors as well as  salivary cortisol reactivity in 88 adolescents. In terms of behavioral outcomes,  analyses revealed that negative emotionality and constraint were protective of  impulsivity and risk taking, respectively, for adolescents in the no-stress  condition; personality did not relate to either behavior in the stress  condition. Low-constraint adolescents in the stress condition engaged in less  risk taking than low-constraint adolescents in the no-stress condition, whereas  there was no effect of stress group for high-constraint adolescents. In terms of  cortisol reactivity, analyses revealed that low-constraint adolescents in the  stress condition exhibited greater cortisol reactivity compared to  high-constraint adolescents, which suggests that low-constraint adolescents  mobilize greater resources (e.g., increased cognitive control, heightened  attention to threat) in stressful situations relative to nonstressful ones.  These results demonstrate that two facets of disinhibition and cortisol  reactivity are differentially affected by psychosocial stress and personality  (and their interactions) in adolescents.

This study examined whether a family-based preventive intervention for  inner-city children entering the first grade could alter the developmental  course of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Participants  were 424 families randomly selected and randomly assigned to a control condition  (n = 192) or Schools and Families Educating Children (SAFE) Children (n = 232).  SAFE Children combined family-focused prevention with academic tutoring to  address multiple developmental-ecological needs. A booster intervention provided  in the 4th grade to randomly assigned children in the initial intervention (n  =101) evaluated the potential of increasing preventive effects. Follow-up  occurred over 5 years with parents and teachers reporting on attention problems.  Growth mixture models identified multiple developmental trajectories of ADHD  symptoms. The initial phase of intervention placed children on more positive  developmental trajectories for impulsivity and hyperactivity, demonstrating the  potential for ADHD prevention in at-risk youth, but the SAFE Children booster  had no additional effect on trajectory or change in ADHD indicators.

Furman W(1), Collibee C(1).	Author information: (1)University of Denver.	The present study compared two theories of the association between romantic  involvement and adjustment: a social timetable theory and a developmental task  theory. We examined seven waves of longitudinal data on a community based sample  of 200 participants (Wave 1 mean age = 15 years, 10 months). In each wave,  multiple measures of substance use, externalizing symptoms, and internalizing  symptoms were gathered, typically from multiple reporters. Multilevel modeling  revealed that greater levels of romantic involvement in adolescence were  associated with higher levels of substance use and externalizing symptoms but  became associated with lower levels in adulthood. Having a romantic partner was  associated with greater levels of substance use, externalizing symptoms, and  internalizing symptoms in adolescence but was associated with lower levels in  young adulthood. The findings were not consistent with a social timetable  theory, which predicts that nonnormative involvement is associated with poor  adjustment. Instead, the findings are consistent with a developmental task  theory, which predicts that precocious romantic involvement undermines  development and adaptation, but when romantic involvement becomes a salient  developmental task in adulthood, it is associated with positive adjustment.

Carlson EA(1), Hostinar CE(1), Mliner SB(1), Gunnar MR(1).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development.	This study examined the formation and quality of attachment of 65  postinstitutionalized (PI) toddlers with their parents at 1-3 and 7-9 months  postadoption compared to 52 nonadopted (NA) children. The formation of  attachment relationships of PI children with adoptive parents occurred  relatively quickly. Children exposed to greater preadoption adversity took  longer to form an attachment to their adoptive parents, although by 7-9 months  postadoption, nearly all (90%) of the children achieved the highest level on an  attachment formation rating scale. PI children did not differ from NA children  in attachment security, based either on the Attachment Q-Sort or Strange  Situation categorical scoring. However, the PI children were more likely to be  disorganized in their attachment patterns. Preadoption adversity was related to  lower Q-sort security scores especially at the initial assessment 1-3 months  postadoption. The results indicated that attachment formation and attachment  quality in PI children are differentiable constructs with different precursors.

Behavioral inhibition, a temperament identifiable in infancy, is associated with  heightened withdrawal from social encounters. Prior studies raise particular  interest in the striatum, which responds uniquely to monetary gains in  behaviorally inhibited children followed into adolescence. Although behavioral  manifestations of inhibition are expressed primarily in the social domain, it  remains unclear whether observed striatal alterations to monetary incentives  also extend to social contexts. In the current study, imaging data were acquired  from 39 participants (17 males, 22 females; ages 16-18 years) characterized  since infancy on measures of behavioral inhibition. A social evaluation task was  used to assess neural response to anticipation and receipt of positive and  negative feedback from novel peers, classified by participants as being of high  or low interest. As with monetary rewards, striatal response patterns differed  during both anticipation and receipt of social reward between behaviorally  inhibited and noninhibited adolescents. The current results, when combined with  prior findings, suggest that early-life temperament predicts altered striatal  response in both social and nonsocial contexts and provide support for  continuity between temperament measured in early childhood and neural response  to social signals measured in late adolescence and early adulthood.

Allen JP(1), Chango J(1), Szwedo D(1), Schad M(1).	Author information: (1)University of Virginia.	The long-term sequelae of adolescent depressive symptoms were examined in a  multimethod, multireporter study of a diverse community sample of 179  adolescents followed from age 14 to 24. Mild to moderate levels of early  adolescent depressive symptoms were found to predict lower maternal relationship  quality, less positive interactions with romantic partners, and greater  loneliness in adulthood even after accounting for prior levels of social  functioning and for concurrent levels of adult depressive symptoms. Predictions  were partially mediated via late adolescent avoidance of social interactions and  poor maternal relationship quality. Results are interpreted as suggesting the  potential impact of depressive symptoms on adolescent social development and the  need to consider treatment for even mild symptoms and their social concomitants.

Shenk CE(1), Putnam FW(2), Rausch JR(3), Peugh JL(3), Noll JG(1).	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University. (2)University of North Carolina School of Medicine. (3)University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.	Child maltreatment is a reliable predictor of posttraumatic stress disorder  (PTSD) symptoms. However, not all maltreated children develop PTSD symptoms,  suggesting that additional mediating variables explain how certain maltreated  children develop PTSD symptoms and others do not. The current study tested three  potential mediators of the relationship between child maltreatment and  subsequent PTSD symptoms: (a) respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity, (b)  cortisol reactivity, and (c) experiential avoidance, or the unwillingness to  experience painful private events, such as thoughts and memories. Maltreated (n  = 51) and nonmaltreated groups (n = 59) completed a stressor paradigm, a measure  of experiential avoidance, and a semistructured interview of PTSD symptoms. One  year later, participants were readministered the PTSD symptoms interview.  Results of a multiple mediator model showed the set of potential mediators  mediated the relationship between child maltreatment and subsequent PTSD  symptoms. However, experiential avoidance was the only significant, specific  indirect effect, demonstrating that maltreated children avoiding painful private  events after the abuse were more likely to develop a range of PTSD symptoms 1  year later. These results highlight the importance of experiential avoidance in  the development of PTSD symptoms for maltreated children, and implications for  secondary prevention and clinical intervention models are discussed.

Examination of the impact of socioeconomic status risk on African  American youth.	Beach SR(1), Brody GH(1), Lei MK(1), Kim S(1), Cui J(1), Philibert RA(2).	Author information: (1)University of Georgia. (2)University of Iowa.	We hypothesized that presence of the short allele in the promoter region of the  serotonin transporter would moderate the effect of early cumulative  socioeconomic status (SES) risk on epigenetic change among African American  youth. Contrasting hypotheses regarding the shape of the interaction effect were  generated using vulnerability and susceptibility frameworks and applied to data  from a sample of 388 African American youth. Early cumulative SES risk assessed  at 11-13 years based on parent report interacted with presence of the short  allele to predict differential methylation assessed at age 19. Across multiple  tests, a differential susceptibility perspective rather than a diathesis-stress  framework best fit the data for genes associated with depression, consistently  demonstrating greater epigenetic response to early cumulative SES risk among  short allele carriers. A pattern consistent with greater impact among short  allele carriers also was observed using all cytosine  nucleotide-phosphate-guanine nucleotide sites across the genome that were  differentially affected by early cumulative SES risk. We conclude that the short  allele is associated with increased responsiveness to early cumulative SES risk  among African American youth, leading to epigenetic divergence for  depression-related genes in response to exposure to heightened SES risk among  short allele carriers in a "for better" or "for worse" pattern.

Shonkoff JP(1), Fisher PA(2).	Author information: (1)Harvard University. (2)University of Oregon.	Half a century of research and program evaluation has fueled a diverse landscape  of early childhood policies and practices that produce a range of positive  effects on the life prospects of children who face the burdens of significant  adversity. Drawing on advances in neurobiology, developmental psychology,  developmental psychopathology, and prevention science, this paper presents a  framework for elucidating underlying causal mechanisms that explain differences  in outcomes, formulating enhanced theories of change about how to shift  developmental trajectories, designing creative interventions and rethinking the  concept of a two-generation strategy to produce breakthrough impacts, and  launching a new era of investment in young children and their families that will  achieve greater reductions in intergenerational disparities in learning,  behavior, and health than those produced by current best practices. Particular  attention is focused on the hypothesis that substantially better outcomes for  vulnerable, young children could be achieved by greater attention to  strengthening the resources and capabilities of the adults who care for them  rather than by continuing to focus primarily on the provision of child-focused  enrichment, parenting education, and informal support. Central to achieving this  goal is the need to establish an innovation-friendly environment that embraces  fast-cycle sharing, supports risk taking, and celebrates learning from failure.

Childhood exposure to violence and lifelong health: clinical intervention  science and stress-biology research join forces.	Moffitt TE(1); Klaus-Grawe 2012 Think Tank.	Author information: (1)Duke University.	Many young people who are mistreated by an adult, victimized by bullies,  criminally assaulted, or who witness domestic violence react to this violence  exposure by developing behavioral, emotional, or learning problems. What is less  well known is that adverse experiences like violence exposure can lead to hidden  physical alterations inside a child's body, alterations that may have adverse  effects on life-long health. We discuss why this is important for the field of  developmental psychopathology and for society, and we recommend that  stress-biology research and intervention science join forces to tackle the  problem. We examine the evidence base in relation to stress-sensitive measures  for the body (inflammatory reactions, telomere erosion, epigenetic methylation,  and gene expression) and brain (mental disorders, neuroimaging, and  neuropsychological testing). We also review promising interventions for  families, couples, and children that have been designed to reduce the effects of  childhood violence exposure. We invite intervention scientists and  stress-biology researchers to collaborate in adding stress-biology measures to  randomized clinical trials of interventions intended to reduce effects of  violence exposure and other traumas on young people.

Author information: (1)Arizona State University. (2)University of Missouri. (3)University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.	The last 25 years have seen significant advances in our conceptualization of  alcohol use and alcohol use disorders within a developmental framework, along  with advances in our empirical understanding that have been potentiated by  advances in quantitative methods. These include advances in understanding the  heterogeneity of trajectories of alcohol outcomes; new insights about early  childhood antecedents, and adolescence and emerging adulthood as important  developmental periods for alcohol outcomes; a more nuanced understanding of the  influences of developmental transitions, and their timing and contexts; a  greater appreciation for the importance of considering multiple levels of  analysis (including an increasing number of genetically informative studies); a  continuing focus on studying multiple pathways underlying alcohol outcomes; and  an increasing focus on studying the effects of alcohol exposure on future  development. The current paper reviews these advances and suggests directions  for future study.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579413000771 PMCID: PMC4080810 PMID: 24342856 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The reformulation of emotional security theory: the role of children's social  defense in developmental psychopathology.	Davies PT(1), Martin MJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester.	Although children's security in the context of the interparental relationship  has been identified as a key explanatory mechanism in pathways between family  discord and child psychopathology, little is known about the inner workings of  emotional security as a goal system. Thus, the objective of this paper is to  describe how our reformulation of emotional security theory within an  ethological and evolutionary framework may advance the characterization of the  architecture and operation of emotional security and, in the process, cultivate  sustainable growing points in developmental psychopathology. The first section  of the paper describes how children's security in the interparental relationship  is organized around a distinctive behavioral system designed to defend against  interpersonal threat. Building on this evolutionary foundation for emotional  security, the paper offers an innovative taxonomy for identifying qualitatively  different ways children try to preserve their security and its innovative  implications for more precisely informing understanding of the mechanisms in  pathways between family and developmental precursors and children's trajectories  of mental health. In the final section, the paper highlights the potential of  the reformulation of emotional security theory to stimulate new generations of  research on understanding how children defend against social threats in  ecologies beyond the interparental dyad, including both familial and  extrafamilial settings.

Calkins SD(1), Propper C(2), Mills-Koonce WR(2).	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Greensboro. (2)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.	Although considerable research has examined the relations between parental  behavior and a range of child developmental outcomes, much of this work has been  conducted at a very broad level of behavioral analysis. A developmental  psychopathology framework and recent research conducted within this framework  point to the need for models of parenting and child psychopathology that offer  greater specificity regarding processes that may be implicated in the effects of  these relationships. In addition, recent animal work and some human work has  focused more on the proximal biological and social mechanisms through which  parenting affects child outcomes. Our conceptualization of parenting effects  acknowledges that family and child factors are embedded in a dynamic biological  and social context that is key to understanding developmental trajectories of  child adjustment. In this paper, we review two areas of research that are  illuminating the biological processes underlying links between parenting and  child psychopathology: molecular genetics and psychophysiology. We adopt a  biopsychosocial perspective on developmental psychopathology that implies that a  set of hierarchically organized, but reciprocally interacting, processes, from  the genetic to the environmental, provide the essential elements of both  normative and nonnormative development (Gottlieb, 2007). New directions  stimulated by this general approach are discussed, with an emphasis on the  contextual and developmental issues and applications implied by such a  perspective.

Author information: (1)King's College London.	The momentum of genomic science will carry it far into the future and into the  heart of research on typical and atypical behavioral development. The purpose of  this paper is to focus on a few implications and applications of these advances  for understanding behavioral development. Quantitative genetics is genomic and  will chart the course for molecular genomic research now that these two worlds  of genetics are merging in the search for many genes of small effect. Although  current attempts to identify specific genes have had limited success, known as  the missing heritability problem, whole-genome sequencing will improve this  situation by identifying all DNA sequence variations, including rare variants.  Because the heritability of complex traits is caused by many DNA variants of  small effect in the population, polygenic scores that are composites of hundreds  or thousands of DNA variants will be used by developmentalists to predict  children's genetic risk and resilience. The most far-reaching advance will be  the widespread availability of whole-genome sequence for children, which means  that developmentalists would no longer need to obtain DNA or to genotype  children in order to use genomic information in research or in the clinic.

Author information: (1)University of California, Davis. (2)Queen Mary University of London.	We provide a theoretical and empirical basis for the claim that individual  differences exist in developmental plasticity and that phenotypic plasticity  should be a subject of study in its own right. To advance this argument, we  begin by highlighting challenges that evolutionary thinking poses for a science  of development and psychopathology, including for the diathesis-stress framework  that has (fruitfully) guided so much empirical inquiry on developmental risk,  resilience, and dysregulation. With this foundation laid, we raise a series of  issues that the differential-susceptibility hypothesis calls attention to, while  highlighting findings that have emerged over just the past several years and are  pertinent to some of the questions posed. Even though it is clear that this new  perspective on Person × Environment interaction is stimulating research and  influencing how hypotheses are framed and data interpreted, a great many topics  remain that need empirical attention. Our intention is to encourage students of  development and psychopathology to treat phenotypic plasticity as an  individual-difference construct while exploring unknowns in the  differential-susceptibility equation.

Identifying childhood characteristics that underlie premorbid risk for substance  use disorders: socialization and boldness.	Hicks BM(1), Iacono WG(2), McGue M(2).	Author information: (1)University of Michigan. (2)University of Minnesota.	We utilized a longitudinal twin study (N = 2,510) to identify the child  characteristics present prior to initiation of substance use that best predicted  later substance use disorders. Two independent traits accounted for the majority  of premorbid risk: socialization (conformity to rules and conventional values)  and boldness (sociability and social assurance, stress resilience, and thrill  seeking). Low socialization was associated with disruptive behavior disorders,  parental externalizing disorders, and environmental adversity and exhibited  moderate genetic (0.45) and shared environmental influences (0.30). Boldness was  highly heritable (0.71) and associated with less internalizing distress and  environmental adversity. In combination, these traits exhibited robust  associations with adolescent and young adult substance use disorders (R = .48  and .50, respectively) and incremental prediction over disruptive behavior  disorders, parental externalizing disorders, and environmental adversity. The  results were replicated in an independent sample. Socialization and boldness  offer a novel conceptualization of underlying risk for substance use disorders  that has the potential to improve prediction and theory with implications for  basic research, prevention, and intervention.

Dopamine receptor D4 gene moderates the effect of positive and negative peer  experiences on later delinquency: the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives  Survey study.	Kretschmer T(1), Dijkstra JK, Ormel J, Verhulst FC, Veenstra R.	Author information: (1)University of Groningen.	The quality of adolescents' relationships with peers can have a lasting impact  on later psychosocial adjustment, mental health, and behavior. However, the  effect of peer relations on later problem behavior is not uniformly strong, and  genetic factors might influence this association. This study used four-wave  longitudinal (11-19 years) data (n = 1,151) from the Tracking Adolescents'  Individual Lives Survey, a Dutch cohort study into adolescent development to  test whether the dopamine receptor D4 polymorphism moderates the impact of  negative (i.e., victimization) and positive peer experiences (i.e., social  well-being) on later delinquency. Contrary to our expectations, results showed  that carriers of the dopamine receptor D4 gene 4-repeat homozygous variant  instead of those carrying the 7-repeat allele were more susceptible to the  effects of both peer victimization and social well-being on delinquency later in  adolescence. Findings of our study are discussed in light of other studies into  genetic moderation of peer effects on adolescent development and the possibility  that developmental specifics in adolescence, such as maturation processes in  brain structure and functioning, may affect the interplay of environmental and  genetic factors in this period in life.

Earlier age of menarche is believed to confer greater vulnerability to  depressive symptoms via increased reactivity to stressors associated with  adolescence. In this longitudinal study, we measured depressive symptoms and  salivary cortisol levels in 198 boys and 142 girls between the ages of 11 and 13  tested four times during Grade 7 as they transitioned from elementary school to  secondary school as per Quebec's education system. Results showed that girls who  had already reached menarche before starting secondary school had significantly  higher depressive symptoms and salivary cortisol levels across the school year  in comparison to girls who had not reached menarche, who in turn presented  higher depressive scores than boys. When we divided menarcheal girls as a  function of menarcheal timing in subanalyses, we found that girls with early  menarche presented consistently elevated depressive symptoms across the school  year while girls with on-time menarche presented transient depressive symptoms  but no differences in salivary cortisol levels. Collectively, these results show  that early menarche is associated with high depressive symptoms and cortisol  levels in adolescent girls. This developmental milestone may render girls more  vulnerable to environmental stressors and therefore represents a critical period  to intervene to promote mental health.

In this study, we prospectively examined developmental trajectories of five  anxiety disorder symptom dimensions (generalized anxiety disorder, panic  disorder, school anxiety, separation anxiety disorder, and social anxiety  disorder) from early to late adolescence in a community sample of 239  adolescents, assessed annually over 8 years. Latent growth modeling indicated  different developmental trajectories from early into late adolescence for the  different anxiety disorder symptoms, with some symptoms decreasing and other  symptoms increasing over time. Sex differences in developmental trajectories  were found for some symptoms, but not all. Furthermore, latent class growth  analysis identified a normal developmental profile (including a majority of  adolescents reporting persistent low anxiety disorder symptoms over 8 years) and  an at-risk developmental profile (including a minority of adolescents reporting  persistent high anxiety disorder symptoms over 8 years) for all of the anxiety  disorder symptom dimensions except panic disorder. Additional analyses  longitudinally supported the validity of these normal and at-risk developmental  profiles and suggested differential associations between different anxiety  disorder symptom dimensions and developmental trajectories of substance use,  parenting, and identity development. Taken together, our results emphasize the  importance of examining separate dimensions of anxiety disorder symptoms in  contrast to a using a global, one-dimensional approach to anxiety.

The cognitive and neural correlates of psychopathy and especially  callous-unemotional traits in youths: a systematic review of the evidence.	Herpers PC(1), Scheepers FE(2), Bons DM(1), Buitelaar JK(1), Rommelse NN(1).	Author information: (1)Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre. (2)University Medical Centre Utrecht.	It is unclear whether the concepts and findings of the underlying neurobiology  of adult psychopathy apply to youths as well. If so, a life span approach to  treatment should be taken. Because youths' brains are still developing,  interventions at an early age may be far more effective in the long run. The aim  of this systematic review is to examine whether the neurocognitive and  neurobiological factors that underlie juvenile psychopathy, and specifically  callous-unemotional (CU) traits, are similar to those underlying adult  psychopathy. The results show that youths with CU traits show lower levels of  prosocial reasoning, lower emotional responsivity, and decreased harm avoidance.  Brain imaging studies in youths with CU traits are still rare. Available studies  suggest specific neural correlates, such as a reduced response of the amygdala  and a weaker functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventromedial  prefrontal cortex. These findings are largely in line with existing theories of  adult psychopathy, such as the dual-hormone serotonergic hypothesis and the  integrated emotions systems theory. We recommend that future studies investigate  the role of oxytocin, invest in the study of neural mechanisms, and study the  precursors, risk factors, and correlates of CU traits in early infancy and in  longitudinal designs.

(3)Sydney Children's Hospital. (4)National University of Singapore.	Child conduct problems (CPs) are a robust predictor of adult mental health; the  concurrence of callous-unemotional (CU) traits confers specific risk for  psychopathy. Psychopathy may be related to disturbances in the oxytocin (OXT)  system. Evidence suggests that epigenetic changes in the OXT receptor gene  (OXTR) are associated with lower circulating OXT and social-cognitive  difficulties. We tested methylation levels of OXTR in 4- to 16-year-old males  who met DSM criteria for a diagnosis of oppositional-defiant or conduct disorder  and were stratified by CU traits and age. Measures were DNA methylation levels  of six CpG sites in the promoter region of the OXTR gene (where a CpG site is a  cytosine nucleotide occurs next to a guanine nucleotide in the linear sequence  of bases along its lenth, linked together by phosphate binding), and OXT blood  levels. High CU traits were associated with greater methylation of the OXTR gene  for two cytosine nucleotide and guanine nucleotide phosphate linked sites and  lower circulating OXT in older males. Higher methylation correlated with lower  OXT levels. We conclude that greater methylation of OXTR characterizes  adolescent males with high levels of CU and CPs, and this methylation is  associated with lower circulating OXT and functional impairment in interpersonal  empathy. The results add genetic evidence that high CU traits specify a distinct  subgroup within CP children, and they suggest models of psychopathy may be  informed by further identification of these epigenetic processes and their  functional significance.

The distinctive role of romantic relationships in moderating the effects of  early caregiving on adult anxious-depressed symptoms over 9 years.	Salvatore JE(1), Haydon KC, Simpson JA, Collins WA.	Author information: (1)Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA. jesalvatore@vcu.edu	This study tests a model of young adult romantic quality as a moderator of the  effects of early caregiving on anxious-depressed symptoms over a 9-year period  in adulthood. Participants (n = 93) were a subsample from a longitudinal study  of risk and adaptation. Quality of early caregiving was measured using  observational data collected at five points in the first 4 years of life. Young  adult romantic relationship quality was assessed from interviews with  participants at age 23. Self-report anxious-depressed symptoms were measured at  ages 23, 26, and 32. The results indicated that romantic quality moderated early  caregiving to predict symptom levels across this period, with evidence for  inoculation, amplification, and compensation effects. A discriminant analysis  examining young adult work competence as a moderator provided further evidence  for the distinctiveness of romantic relationships in changing the association  between early caregiving and adult internalizing symptoms.

Author information: (1)University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, USA.	A secondary analysis of the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development was conducted to  test the mechanisms by which relational aggression in third grade was associated  both directly and indirectly with relational victimization in sixth grade. A  large sample (N = 1,035; 522 girls; M = 8.3 years old; SD = 0.23) and multiple  informants (teacher, child, and parent report) and methods were used to test  several theoretically driven hypotheses. Our path analysis model suggested  evidence for both direct and indirect pathways consistent with the sequential  social process model of peer harassment. Relational aggression was significantly  associated with future relational victimization even after controlling for  physical aggression and gender. Loneliness mediated the direct association  between relational aggression and peer victimization. A second model testing the  reverse direction of effect revealed that relational victimization in third  grade predicted relational aggression in sixth grade and was associated with  loneliness and depressive symptoms in fifth grade, but there was no evidence for  any of the indirect pathways.

Prospective developmental subtypes of alcohol dependence from age 18 to 32  years: implications for nosology, etiology, and intervention.	Meier MH(1), Caspi A, Houts R, Slutske WS, Harrington H, Jackson KM, Belsky DW,  Poulton R, Moffitt TE.	Author information: (1)Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA.	The purpose of the present study is to identify child and adult correlates that  differentiate (a) individuals with persistent alcohol dependence from  individuals with developmentally limited alcohol dependence and (b) individuals  with adult-onset alcohol dependence from individuals who never diagnose. There  are 1,037 members of the Dunedin Longitudinal Study, which is a birth cohort  followed prospectively from birth until age 32. Past-year DSM-IV alcohol  dependence diagnoses are ascertained with structured diagnostic interviews at  ages 18, 21, 26, and 32. Individuals are classified as developmentally limited,  persistent, or adult-onset subtypes based on their time-ordered pattern of  diagnoses. The persistent subtype generally exhibits the worst scores on all  correlates, including family psychiatric history, adolescent and adult  externalizing and internalizing problems, adolescent and adult substance use,  adult quality of life, and coping strategies. The prospective predictors that  distinguished them from the developmentally limited subtype involved family  liability, adolescent negative affectivity, daily alcohol use, and frequent  marijuana use. Furthermore, young people who develop the persistent subtype of  alcohol dependence are distinguished from the developmentally limited subtype by  an inability to reduce drinking and by continued use despite problems by age 18.  The adult-onset group members are virtually indistinguishable from ordinary  cohort members as children or adolescents; however, in adulthood, adult-onset  cases are distinguished by problems with depression, substance use, stress, and  strategies for coping with stress. Information about age of onset and  developmental course is fundamental for identifying subtypes of alcohol  dependence. Subtype-specific etiologies point to targeted prevention and  intervention efforts based on the characteristics of each subtype.

Ramos-Olazagasti MA(1), Shrout PE, Yoshikawa H, Canino GJ, Bird HR.	Author information: (1)New York University, New York, NY, USA. maria.ramos@nyumc.org	Research on ethnic-minority youths' mental health has rarely examined  developmental trajectories for the same ethnic group in contexts where they are  a minority versus where they are the majority or mechanisms accounting for  differences in trajectories across such contexts. This study examines Puerto  Rican youth residing in two contexts, one in which they are in their home  culture of Puerto Rico and one in which they are a minority group, in New York.  We explore the relationship among social context, minority status, risk,  resilience, and trajectories of internalizing symptoms after adjusting for  factors related to migration. We found that youths' reports of internalizing  symptoms declined over time. Youths in New York had higher levels of  internalizing symptoms than did youths in Puerto Rico, but they had similar  trajectories. Differences in internalizing symptoms across the two social  contexts were accounted for by experiences of discrimination and exposure to  violence. Parental monitoring was associated with fewer internalizing symptoms  across the two sites, although this effect diminished over time. Contrary to  what was expected, family religiosity was associated with higher levels of  internalizing symptoms. This association was stronger in New York than in the  Puerto Rico site.

Interests in high-functioning autism are more intense, interfering, and  idiosyncratic than those in neurotypical development.	Anthony LG(1), Kenworthy L, Yerys BE, Jankowski KF, James JD, Harms MB, Martin  A, Wallace GL.	Author information: (1)George Washington University School of Medicine, Rockville, MD, USA.  lanthony@childrensnational.org	Although circumscribed interests are pathognomonic with autism, much about these  interests remains unknown. Using the Interests Scale (IS), this study compares  interests between 76 neurotypical (NT) individuals and 109 individuals with  high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HF-ASD) matched groupwise on age, IQ,  and gender ratio. Participants and their parents/caregivers completed diagnostic  measures (the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Autism Diagnostic  Observation Schedule; HF-ASD only), cognitive tests (Wechsler IQ Scales), and  questionnaires (the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, the Behavior Rating  Inventory of Executive Function, and the Social Responsiveness Scale), in  addition to the IS. Consistent with previous research, HF-ASD and NT individuals  did not differ in number of interest areas, but the types of interests and  intensity of those interests differed considerably. Using only the IS intensity  score, 81% of individuals were correctly classified (NT or HF-ASD) in a logistic  regression analysis. Among individuals with HF-ASD, Interests Scale scores were  significantly related to Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Behavior Rating  Inventory of Executive Function, Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and Social  Responsiveness Scale scores, but they were not related to Autism Diagnostic  Interview-Revised scores, IQ, gender, age, or psychotropic medication use. The  type and intensity, but not the number, of interests distinguish  high-functioning individuals with ASD from NT individuals.

Gene × environment effects of serotonin transporter, dopamine receptor D4, and  monoamine oxidase A genes with contextual and parenting risk factors on symptoms  of oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety, and depression in a community sample  of 4-year-old children.	Lavigne JV(1), Herzing LB, Cook EH, Lebailly SA, Gouze KR, Hopkins J, Bryant FB.	Author information: (1)Northwestern University, USA. jlavigne@childrensmemorial.org	Genetic factors can play a key role in the multiple level of analyses approach  to understanding the development of child psychopathology. The present study  examined gene-environment correlations and gene × environment interactions for  polymorphisms of three target genes, the serotonin transporter gene, the D4  dopamine receptor gene, and the monoamine oxidase A gene in relation to symptoms  of anxiety, depression, and oppositional behavior. Saliva samples were collected  from 175 non-Hispanic White, 4-year-old children. Psychosocial risk factors  included socioeconomic status, life stress, caretaker depression, parental  support, hostility, and scaffolding skills. In comparison with the short forms  (s/s, s/l) of the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic repeat, the long form  (l/l) was associated with greater increases in symptoms of oppositional defiant  disorder in interaction with family stress and with greater increases in  symptoms of child depression and anxiety in interaction with caretaker  depression, family conflict, and socioeconomic status. In boys, low-activity  monoamine oxidase A gene was associated with increases in child anxiety and  depression in interaction with caretaker depression, hostility, family conflict,  and family stress. The results highlight the important of gene-environment  interplay in the development of symptoms of child psychopathology in young  children.

Brodeur DA(1), Trick LM, Flores H, Marr C, Burack JA.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Acadia University, Canada.  Darlene.Brodeur@Acadiau.ca	We investigated differences in multiple-object tracking among individuals with  Down syndrome (DS) as compared to typically developing children matched on a  visual-spatial mental age of approximately 5.5 years. In order to ensure that  these effects did not originate in differences in encoding or reporting the  positions of targets in distracters after a delay, immediate and delayed report  were measured for static items. Although their immediate and delayed report for  multiple static items was comparable to that of the typically developing  children, the participants with DS performed as if they were only capable of  tracking a single item at a time regardless of the number of targets that needed  to be tracked. This finding is surprising because the operations used in  multiple-object tracking are thought to be necessary for visuospatial tasks,  which are an area of relative strength among persons with DS. These results call  into question the idea that abilities or deficits in multiple-object tracking  predict visuospatial performance, and highlight ways that atypical development  can inform our understanding of typical development.

Historical variation in drug use trajectories across the transition to  adulthood: the trend toward lower intercepts and steeper, ascending slopes.	Jager J(1), Schulenberg JE, O'Malley PM, Bachman JG.	Author information: (1)Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human  Development, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. jagerjo@mail.nih.gov	This study examines historical variation in individual trajectories of heavy  drinking and marijuana use from age 18 to 22. Unlike most studies that have  examined cohort differences in drug use, it focuses on differences in both level  of use and rates of change (growth). Nearly 39,000 youths from the high school  classes of 1976-2004 were surveyed at biennial intervals between the ages of 18  and 22 as part of the national Monitoring the Future study. Between 1976 and  2004, adolescent heavy drinking decreased substantially. However, because the  age 18-22 heavy drinking growth rate increased threefold for males and sixfold  for females during this period, heavy drinking among 21- to 22-year-olds  remained largely stable. The growth rate for marijuana use was more stable  across cohorts, and historical declines in use were sizable across the entire  18-22 age band. Generally, historical variation in use was unrelated to college  status and living arrangements as well as to historical changes in the  distribution of young adult social roles. Findings suggest that historical  fluctuations in use were less the result of proximal young adult factors and  more the result of historical variation in distal adolescent factors, the effect  of which diminished with age, especially for heavy drinking.

Pubertal timing and depressive symptoms in late adolescence: the moderating role  of individual, peer, and parental factors.	Benoit A(1), Lacourse E, Claes M.	Author information: (1)University of Montreal.	This longitudinal study examined personal-accentuation and  contextual-amplification models of pubertal timing. In these models, individual  and contextual risk factors during childhood and adolescence can magnify the  effects of early or late puberty on depression symptoms that occur years later.  The moderating role of prepubertal individual factors (emotional problems in  late childhood) and interpersonal factors (deviant peer affiliation, early  dating, perceived peer popularity, and perceived parental rejection during  adolescence) were tested. A representative sample of 1,431 Canadian adolescents  between 10-11 and 16-17 years of age was followed biannually. In line with the  personal-accentuation model, early puberty has been shown to be a predictor for  depression in both girls and boys who presented emotional problems in childhood.  This effect was also noted for late maturing boys. Consistent with the  contextual-amplification model, early puberty predicted later depression in  youth who perceived greater parental rejection. Interpersonal experiences such  as early dating in girls and deviant peer affiliation in boys predicted  depression in early maturers as well. For girls, early dating was also found to  be amplified by childhood emotional problems. In line with biopsychosocial  models, results indicate that the effect of pubertal timing on depressive  symptoms must be conceptualized through complex interactions between  characteristics of adolescents' interpersonal relationships and prepubertal  vulnerabilities.

Effects of early maternal distress and parenting on the development of  children's self-regulation and externalizing behavior.	Choe DE(1), Olson SL, Sameroff AJ.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109, USA.  danieewo@umich.edu	Emotional distress experienced by mothers increases young children's risk of  externalizing problems through suboptimal parenting and child self-regulation.  An integrative structural equation model tested hypotheses that mothers'  parenting (i.e., low levels of inductive discipline and maternal warmth) would  mediate adverse effects of early maternal distress on child effortful control,  which in turn would mediate effects of maternal parenting on child externalizing  behavior. This longitudinal study spanning ages 3, 6, and 10 included 241  children, mothers, and a subset of teachers. The hypothesized model was  partially supported. Elevated maternal distress was associated with less  inductive discipline and maternal warmth, which in turn were associated with  less effortful control at age 3 but not at age 6. Inductive discipline and  maternal warmth mediated adverse effects of maternal distress on children's  effortful control. Less effortful control at ages 3 and 6 predicted smaller  relative decreases in externalizing behavior at 6 and 10, respectively.  Effortful control mediated effects of inductive discipline, but not maternal  warmth, on externalizing behavior. Findings suggest elevated maternal distress  increases children's risk of externalizing problems by compromising early  parenting and child self-regulation.

Codevelopment of externalizing and internalizing symptoms in middle to late  childhood: sex, baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and respiratory sinus  arrhythmia reactivity as predictors.	Hinnant JB(1), El-Sheikh M.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Catholic University of America, Washington, DC  20064, USA. hinnant@cua.edu	We investigated the roles of sex and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), an  index of autonomic parasympathetic nervous system activity, as predictors of  codeveloping externalizing and internalizing symptoms in middle childhood. We  expected that sex, baseline RSA (RSA-B), and RSA reactivity (RSA-R) to two types  of tasks would interact to differentiate co-occurring trajectories of symptoms.  We tested these hypotheses by combining longitudinal data from two independent  samples (n = 390; 210 girls, 180 boys) with repeated measures at ages 8, 9, 10,  and 11. RSA-R was measured in response to a socially stressful and frustrating  stressor. Indicators of growth in externalizing and internalizing symptoms were  derived from multiple domain growth models and used in person-centered growth  mixture analyses. Three groups of externalizing and internalizing trajectories  were found. Profile membership was predicted by several two-way interactions  among sex, RSA-B, or RSA-R but was not predicted by three-way interactions.  Children with low RSA-B and strong RSA withdrawal, girls with low RSA-B, and  girls with strong RSA withdrawal were more likely to be on a developmental  trajectory of low externalizing symptoms and moderately elevated internalizing  symptoms. Membership in the high externalizing and high internalizing trajectory  was predicted by weak RSA withdrawal for boys and strong RSA withdrawal for  girls. The type of stressor task also played a role in predicting probability of  profile membership. Results are discussed in the context of developmental  psychobiology and implications for the codevelopment of psychopathology symptoms  in childhood.

Halligan SL(1), Cooper PJ, Fearon P, Wheeler SL, Crosby M, Murray L.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Bath, UK. s.l.halligan@bath.ac.uk	The development of emotional regulation capacities in children at high versus  low risk for externalizing disorder was examined in a longitudinal study  investigating: (a) whether disturbances in emotion regulation precede and  predict the emergence of externalizing symptoms and (b) whether sensitive  maternal behavior is a significant influence on the development of child emotion  regulation. Families experiencing high (n = 58) and low (n = 63) levels of  psychosocial adversity were recruited to the study during pregnancy. Direct  observational assessments of child emotion regulation capacities and maternal  sensitivity were completed in early infancy, at 12 and 18 months, and at 5  years. Key findings were as follows. First, high-risk children showed poorer  emotion regulation capacities than their low-risk counterparts at every stage of  assessment. Second, from 12 months onward, emotion regulation capacities showed  a degree of stability and were associated with behavioral problems, both  concurrently and prospectively. Third, maternal sensitivity was related to child  emotion regulation capacities throughout development, with poorer emotion  regulation in the high-risk group being associated with lower maternal  sensitivity. The results are consistent with a causal role for problems in the  regulation of negative emotions in the etiology of externalizing psychopathology  and highlight insensitive parenting as a potentially key developmental  influence.

Hyde LW(1), Shaw DS, Gardner F, Cheong J, Dishion TJ, Wilson M.	Author information: (1)University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA. LukeHyde@UMich.edu	This study examined dimensions of callous behaviors in early childhood and the  role of these behaviors in the development of conduct problems, as well as  responsiveness to a family-centered preventative intervention. Caregiver reports  of callous behaviors were examined using exploratory and confirmatory factor  analysis. Problem behavior was examined using within- and cross-informant  reports of these behaviors. Parenting was measured using observational methods  within the context of a randomized control trial of the Family Check-Up with a  sample of 731 ethnically diverse boys and girls (followed from ages 2 to 4) at  high risk for later conduct problems. Results demonstrated that a measure of  deceitful-callous (DC) behaviors had acceptable factor loadings and internal  consistency at ages 3 and 4. DC behaviors at age 3 predicted problem behavior  concurrently and longitudinally within and across informant. However, DC  behaviors did not reduce the effectiveness of the family preventative  intervention. These findings have implications for our understanding of  behaviors that may precede later callous-unemotional traits and for our  understanding of the development and prevention of early starting conduct  problems.

Brendgen M(1), Vitaro F, Bukowski WM, Dionne G, Tremblay RE, Boivin M.	Author information: (1)University of Quebec at Montreal, Canada. Brendgen.Mara@uqam.ca	The study examined whether reciprocal friendship quantity or quality can  mitigate genetic vulnerability for depression symptoms in children. The sample  comprised 168 monozygotic twin pairs and 126 same-sex dizygotic twin pairs  assessed in Grade 4 (mean age = 10.04 years). Friendship participation was  measured via reciprocal nominations of close friendships within the classroom.  Friendship quality was measured through self-reports. Depression symptoms were  measured through teacher and peer reports. Genetic vulnerability for depression  symptoms was unrelated to friendship participation or the number of reciprocal  friends, but it was negatively related to positive friendship quality. In line  with gene-environment interaction, genetic risk effects on depression symptoms  were mitigated in girls who had at least one close reciprocal friend. In boys,  only moderate main effects of genetic vulnerability and friendship participation  were found but no interaction between them. However, among boys with at least  one reciprocal friend, a greater number of friends was related to fewer  depression symptoms whereas no cumulative effect of friendship was found for  girls. Finally, positive friendship quality was related to fewer depression  symptoms in girls and boys even when controlling for genetic risk. The findings  emphasize the importance of teaching social interactional skills that promote  high-quality friendship relations to help prevent the development of depression  symptoms in children.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of California, Riverside, 900 University  Avenue, Riverside, CA 92521, USA. misaki.natsuaki@ucr.edu	To better understand mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of  social anxiety, we used a prospective adoption design to examine the roles of  genetic influences (inferred from birth mothers' social phobia) and rearing  environment (adoptive mothers' and fathers' responsiveness) on the development  of socially inhibited, anxious behaviors in children between 18 and 27 months of  age. The sample consisted of 275 adoption-linked families, each including an  adopted child, adoptive parents, and a birth mother. Results indicated that  children whose birth mothers met criteria for the diagnosis of social phobia  showed elevated levels of observed behavioral inhibition in a social situation  at 27 months of age if their adoptive mothers provided less emotionally and  verbally responsive rearing environments at 18 months of age. Conversely, in the  context of higher levels of maternal responsiveness, children of birth mothers  with a history of social phobia did not show elevated levels of behavioral  inhibition. These findings on maternal responsiveness were replicated in a model  predicting parent reports of child social anxiety. The findings are discussed in  terms of gene-environment interactions in the intergenerational transmission of  social anxiety.

Observed positive parenting behaviors and youth genotype: evidence for  gene-environment correlations and moderation by parent personality traits.	Oppenheimer CW(1), Hankin BL, Jenness JL, Young JF, Smolen A.	Author information: (1)University of Denver, 2155 South Race Street, Denver, CO 80208, USA.	Gene-environment correlations (rGE) have been demonstrated in behavioral genetic  studies, but rGE have proven elusive in molecular genetic research. Significant  gene-environment correlations may be difficult to detect because potential  moderators could reduce correlations between measured genetic variants and the  environment. Molecular genetic studies investigating moderated rGE are lacking.  This study examined associations between child catechol-O-methyltransferase  genotype and aspects of positive parenting (responsiveness and warmth), and  whether these associations were moderated by parental personality traits  (neuroticism and extraversion) among a general community sample of third, sixth,  and ninth graders (N = 263) and their parents. Results showed that parent  personality traits moderated the rGE association between youths' genotype and  coded observations of positive parenting. Parents with low levels of neuroticism  and high levels of extraversion exhibited greater sensitive responsiveness and  warmth, respectively, to youth with the valine/valine genotype. Moreover, youth  with this genotype exhibited lower levels of observed anger. There was no  association between the catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype and parenting  behaviors for parents high on neuroticism and low on extraversion. Findings  highlight the importance of considering moderating variables that may influence  child genetic effects on the rearing environment. Implications for developmental  models of maladaptive and adaptive child outcomes, and interventions for  psychopathology, are discussed within a developmental psychopathology framework.

Hayden EP(1), Hanna B, Sheikh HI, Laptook RS, Kim J, Singh SM, Klein DN.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7,  Canada. ehayden@uwo.ca	The dopamine active transporter 1 (DAT1) gene is implicated in psychopathology  risk. Although the processes by which this gene exerts its effects on risk are  poorly understood, a small body of research suggests that the DAT1 gene  influences early emerging negative emotionality, a marker of children's  psychopathology risk. As child negative emotionality evokes negative parenting  practices, the DAT1 gene may also play a role in gene-environment correlations.  To test this model, children (N = 365) were genotyped for the DAT1 gene and  participated in standardized parent-child interaction tasks with their primary  caregiver. The DAT1 gene 9-repeat variant was associated with child negative  affect expressed toward the parent during parent-child interactions, and parents  of children with a 9-repeat allele exhibited more hostility and lower  guidance/engagement than parents of children without a 9-repeat allele. These  gene-environment associations were partially mediated by child negative affect  toward the parent.

Gene-environment correlation in the development of adolescent substance abuse:  selection effects of child personality and mediation via contextual risk  factors.	Hicks BM(1), Johnson W, Durbin CE, Blonigen DM, Iacono WG, McGue M.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, 4250 Plymouth Road, Ann  Arbor, MI 48109, USA. brianhic@umich.edu	We used a longitudinal twin design to examine selection effects of personality  traits at age 11 on high-risk environmental contexts at age 14 and the extent to  which these contexts mediated risk for substance abuse at age 17. Socialization  at age 11 (willingness to follow rules and endorse conventional values)  predicted exposure to contextual risk at age 14. Contextual risk partially  mediated the effect of socialization on substance abuse, though socialization  also had a direct effect. In contrast, boldness at age 11 (social engagement and  assurance, thrill seeking, and stress resilience) also predicted substance abuse  directly but was unrelated to contextual risk. There was substantial overlap in  the genetic and shared environmental influences on socialization and contextual  risk, and genetic risk in socialization contributed to substance abuse  indirectly via increased exposure to contextual risk. This suggests that active  gene-environment correlations related to individual differences in socialization  contributed to an early, high-risk developmental trajectory for adolescent  substance abuse. In contrast, boldness appeared to index an independent and  direct genetic risk factor for adolescent substance abuse.

Evidence of gene-environment correlation for peer difficulties: disruptive  behaviors predict early peer relation difficulties in school through genetic  effects.	Boivin M(1), Brendgen M, Vitaro F, Forget-Dubois N, Feng B, Tremblay RE, Dionne  G.	Author information: (1)École de Psychologie, Pavillon Félix-Antoine-Savard, 2325 rue des  Bibliothèques, Université Laval, Québec, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.  michel.boivin@psy.ulaval.ca	Early disruptive behaviors, such as aggressive and hyperactive behaviors, known  to be influenced by genetic factors, have been found to predict early school  peer relation difficulties, such as peer rejection and victimization. However,  there is no consensus regarding the developmental processes underlying this  predictive association. Genetically informative designs, such as twin studies,  are well suited for investigating the underlying genetic and environmental  etiology of this association. The main goal of the present study was to examine  the possible establishment of an emerging gene-environment correlation linking  disruptive behaviors to peer relationship difficulties during the first years of  school. Participants were drawn from an ongoing longitudinal study of twins who  were assessed with respect to their social behaviors and their peer relation  difficulties in kindergarten and in Grade 1 through peer nominations measures  and teacher ratings. As predicted, disruptive behaviors were concurrently and  predictively associated with peer relation difficulties. Multivariate analyses  of these associations indicate that they were mainly accounted for by genetic  factors. These results emphasize the need to adopt an early and persistent  prevention framework targeting both the child and the peer context to alleviate  the establishment of a negative coercive process and its consequences.

The study of gene expression (i.e., the study of the transcriptome) in different  cells and tissues allows us to understand the molecular mechanisms of their  differentiation, development and functioning. In this article, we describe some  studies of gene-expression profiling for the purposes of understanding  developmental (age-related) changes in the brain using different technologies  (e.g., DNA-Microarray) and the new and increasingly popular RNA-Seq. We focus on  advancements in studies of gene expression in the human brain, which have  provided data on the structure and age-related variability of the transcriptome  in the brain. We present data on RNA-Seq of the transcriptome in three distinct  areas of the neocortex from different ages: mature and elderly individuals. We  report that most age-related transcriptional changes affect cellular signaling  systems, and, as a result, the transmission of nerve impulses. In general, the  results demonstrate the high potential of RNA-Seq for the study of distinctive  features of gene expression among cortical areas and the changes in expression  through normal and atypical development of the central nervous system.

Naples A(1), Katz L, Grigorenko EL.	Author information: (1)Yale University, New Haven, CT 06519, USA.	Based on numerous suggestions in the literature, we evaluated lexical decision  (LD) as a putative endophenotype for reading comprehension by investigating  heritability estimates and segregation analyses parameter estimates for both of  these phenotypes. Specifically, in a segregation analysis of a large sample of  families, we established that there is little to no overlap between genes  contributing to LD and reading comprehension and that the genetic mechanism  behind LD derived from this analysis appears to be more complex than that for  reading comprehension. We conclude that in our sample, LD is not a good  candidate as an endophenotype for reading comprehension, despite previous  suggestions from the literature. Based on this conclusion, we discuss the role  and benefit of the endophenotype approach in studies of complex human cognitive  functions.

Author information: (1)Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry,  Kings College London, UK. james.rucker@kcl.ac.uk	Copy number variants (CNVs) are submicroscopic deletions and duplications of  genomic material that were previously thought to be rare phenomena. They have  now been robustly associated with a variety of disorders such as autism,  schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder through an emerging  research base in affective disorders. A complex picture is emerging of a  polygenic, heterogeneous model of disease, with CNVs conferring broad  susceptibility to a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, rather than  specific disorders per se. Although the insights gleaned thus far only represent  a small piece of a much larger puzzle, progress has been rapid and new  technologies promise even more insights into these hitherto opaque brain  disorders. We will discuss CNVs, the current state of evidence for their role in  the pathogenesis of classical psychiatric disorders, and the application of such  knowledge in clinical settings.

Propper CB(1), Shanahan MJ, Russo R, Mills-Koonce WR.	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-8115, USA.  propper@unc.edu	Academic performance during the first years of school lays the groundwork for  subsequent trajectories of academic success throughout childhood and  adolescence. The current study tests a model according to which a gene-parenting  correlation in the first 3 years of life is associated with subsequent  psychosocial adjustment and then academic performance in the first grade (as  indicated by teachers' assessment of academic behavior and two subscales of the  Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement, Third Edition). Drawing on multiple waves  of data from the Durham Child Health and Development Study, we find that risk  alleles for dopamine receptor genes (dopamine receptor D4 for girls, dopamine  receptor D2 for boys) are associated with less sensitive parenting. For girls,  parenting mediates the link between dopamine receptor D4 and all academic  outcomes. There is some indication that parenting also influences girls'  withdrawn behavior in the classroom, which in turn influences teachers'  assessments of academic performance. For boys, some evidence suggests that  parenting is associated with emotion regulation, which is associated with  teachers' assessments of academic behavior and both subscales of the  Woodcock-Johnson. Replications of this exploratory study are necessary, but  these findings provide a first step in understanding how evocative correlations  in the home may predict indicators of psychosocial adjustment that in turn  influence performance and achievement at school.

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN  55455, USA. gunnar@umn.edu	Adverse early care is associated with attention regulatory problems, but not all  so exposed develop attention problems. In a sample of 612 youth (girls = 432, M  = 11.82 years, SD = 1.5) adopted from institutions (e.g., orphanages) in 25  countries, we examined whether the Val66Met polymorphism of the brain-derived  neurotrophic factor gene moderates attention problems associated with the  duration of institutional care. Parent-reported attention problem symptoms were  collected using the MacArthur Health and Behavior Questionnaire. DNA was  genotyped for the brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met (rs6265) single  nucleotide polymorphism. Among youth from Southeast (SE) Asia, the predominant  genotype was valine/methionine (Val/Met), whereas among youth from Russia/Europe  and Caribbean/South America, the predominant genotype was Val/Val. For analysis,  youth were grouped as carrying Val/Val or Met/Met alleles. Being female, being  from SE Asia, and being younger when adopted were associated with fewer  attention regulatory problem symptoms. Youth carrying at least one copy of the  Met allele were more sensitive to the duration of deprivation, yielding an  interaction that followed a differential susceptibility pattern. Thus, youth  with Val/Met or Met/Met genotypes exhibited fewer symptoms than Val/Val  genotypes when adoption was very early and more symptoms when adoption occurred  later in development. Similar patterns were observed when SE Asian youth and  youth from other parts of the world were analyzed separately.

The neurobiology of oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder: altered  functioning in three mental domains.	Matthys W(1), Vanderschuren LJ, Schutter DJ.	Author information: (1)University Medical Center Utrecht, B01.324, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX  Utrecht, The Netherlands. w.matthys@umcutrecht.nl	This review discusses neurobiological studies of oppositional defiant disorder  and conduct disorder within the conceptual framework of three interrelated  mental domains: punishment processing, reward processing, and cognitive control.  First, impaired fear conditioning, reduced cortisol reactivity to stress,  amygdala hyporeactivity to negative stimuli, and altered serotonin and  noradrenaline neurotransmission suggest low punishment sensitivity, which may  compromise the ability of children and adolescents to make associations between  inappropriate behaviors and forthcoming punishments. Second, sympathetic nervous  system hyporeactivity to incentives, low basal heart rate associated with  sensation seeking, orbitofrontal cortex hyporeactiviy to reward, and altered  dopamine functioning suggest a hyposensitivity to reward. The associated  unpleasant emotional state may make children and adolescents prone to  sensation-seeking behavior such as rule breaking, delinquency, and substance  abuse. Third, impairments in executive functions, especially when motivational  factors are involved, as well as structural deficits and impaired functioning of  the paralimbic system encompassing the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex,  suggest impaired cognitive control over emotional behavior. In the discussion we  argue that more insight into the neurobiology of oppositional defiance disorder  and conduct disorder may be obtained by studying these disorders separately and  by paying attention to the heterogeneity of symptoms within each disorder.

Author information: (1)Department of Human Development and Family Studies, 110 South Henderson,  Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA. lmk18@psu.edu	Early onset aggression precipitates a cascade of risk factors, increasing the  probability of a range of externalizing and internalizing psychopathological  outcomes. Unfortunately, decades of research on the etiological contributions to  the manifestation of aggression have failed to yield identification of any risk  factors determined to be either necessary or sufficient, likely attributable to  etiological heterogeneity within the construct of aggression. Differential  pathways of etiological risk are not easily discerned at the behavioral or  self-report level, particularly in young children, requiring multilevel analysis  of risk pathways. This study focuses on three domains of risk to examine the  heterogeneity in 207 urban kindergarten children with high levels of aggression:  cognitive processing, socioemotional competence and emotion processing, and  family context. The results indicate that 90% of children in the high aggression  group could be characterized as either low in verbal ability or high in  physiological arousal (resting skin conductance). Children characterized as low  verbal, high arousal, or both differed in social and emotional competence,  physiological reactivity to emotion, and aspects of family-based contextual  risk. The implications of this etiologic heterogeneity of aggression are  discussed in terms of assessment and treatment.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412000491 PMID: 22781867 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Psychology Department, Box 871104, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ  85287-1104, USA. laurie.chassin@asu.edu	This study examined the interplay between the influence of peers who promote  alcohol use and μ-opioid receptor M1 (OPRM1) genetic variation in the  intergenerational transmission of alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms while  separating the "traitlike" components of AUD symptoms from their age-specific  manifestations at three ages from emerging adulthood (17-23 years) to adulthood  (29-40 years). The results for males were consistent with genetically influenced  peer selection mechanisms as mediators of parent alcoholism effects. Male  children of alcoholics were less likely to be carriers of the G allele in single  nucleotide polymorphism A118G (rs1799971), and those who were homozygous for the  A allele were more likely to affiliate with alcohol use promoting peers who  increased the risk for AUD symptoms at all ages. There was evidence for women of  an interaction between OPRM1 variation and peer affiliations but only at the  earliest age band. Peer influences had stronger effects among women who were  G-carriers. These results illustrate the complex ways in which the interplay  between influences at multiple levels of analysis can underlie the  intergenerational transmission of alcohol disorders as well as the importance of  considering age and gender differences in these pathways.

The effects of child maltreatment on early signs of antisocial behavior: genetic  moderation by tryptophan hydroxylase, serotonin transporter, and monoamine  oxidase A genes.	Cicchetti D(1), Rogosch FA, Thibodeau EL.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, 51 East River Road,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. cicchett@umn.edu	Gene-environment interaction effects in predicting antisocial behavior in late  childhood were investigated among maltreated and nonmaltreated low-income  children (N = 627, M age = 11.27). Variants in three genes were examined:  tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region  (5-HTTLPR), and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) upstream variable number tandem  repeat. In addition to child maltreatment status, we considered the impact of  maltreatment subtypes, developmental timing of maltreatment, and chronicity.  Indicators of antisocial behavior were obtained from self-, peer, and adult  counselor reports. In a series of analyses of covariance, child maltreatment and  its parameters demonstrated strong main effects on early antisocial behavior as  assessed by all report forms. Genetic effects operated primarily in the context  of gene-environment interactions, moderating the impact of child maltreatment on  outcomes. Across the three genes, among nonmaltreated children no differences in  antisocial behavior were found based on genetic variation. In contrast, among  maltreated children specific polymorphisms of TPH1, 5-HTTLPR, and MAOA were each  related to heightened self-report of antisocial behavior; the interaction of  5-HTTLPR and developmental timing of maltreatment also indicated more severe  antisocial outcomes for children with early onset and recurrent maltreatment  based on genotype. TPH1 and 5-HTTLPR interacted with maltreatment subtype to  predict peer reports of antisocial behavior; genetic variation contributed to  larger differences in antisocial behavior among abused children. The TPH1 and  5-HTTLPR polymorphisms also moderated the effects of maltreatment subtype on  adult reports of antisocial behavior; again, the genetic effects were strongest  for children who were abused. In addition, TPH1 moderated the effect of  developmental timing of maltreatment and chronicity on adult reports of  antisocial behavior. The findings elucidate how genetic variation contributes to  identifying which maltreated children are most vulnerable to antisocial  development.

Using a cohort of 268 low-income boys  first assessed at 18 months, the current study examined predictors of early- and  late-starting trajectories of AB assessed during early childhood and early  adolescence. Four trajectory groups were identified, including early- and  late-starting groups, a low stable group, and a high decreasing group,  characterized by multiple risk factors during early childhood and early  adolescence. During early childhood, parenting and maternal depression  discriminated two AB trajectory groups, an early-starting and a high decreasing  group, who would go on to demonstrate a high preponderance of juvenile court  involvement (60% to 79%) and elevated rates of clinical depression 13 to 15  years later. The results were discussed in reference to targeting malleable  family risk factors during early childhood associated with patterns of AB and  mental health disorders during adolescence.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.  grazyna-kochanska@uiowa.edu	Early parent-child attachment has been extensively explored as a contributor to  children's future adaptive or antisocial outcomes, but the specific  developmental mechanisms remain to be fully understood. We examined long-term  indirect developmental sequelae of early security in two longitudinal community  samples followed from infancy to early school age: the Family Study (102  mothers, fathers, and infants) and the Parent-Child Study (112 mothers and  infants). Constructs at multiple levels (child characteristics, parent-child  security, parental discipline, and child antisocial outcomes) were assessed  using a range of methods (extensive behavioral observations in a variety of  settings, informants' ratings). Both studies supported the proposed model of  infant attachment as a potent catalyst that moderates future developmental  socialization trajectories, despite having few long-term main effects. In  insecure dyads, a pattern of coercion emerged between children who were anger  prone as toddlers and their parents, resulting in parents' increased  power-assertive discipline. Power assertion in turn predicted children's  rule-breaking conduct and a compromised capacity to delay in laboratory  paradigms, as well as oppositional, disruptive, callous, and aggressive behavior  rated by parents and teachers at early school age. This causal chain was absent  in secure dyads, where child anger proneness was unrelated to power assertion,  and power assertion was unrelated to antisocial outcomes. Early insecurity  appeared to act as a catalyst for the parent-child dyad embarking on a mutually  adversarial path toward antisocial outcomes, whereas security defused such a  maladaptive dynamic. The possible mechanisms of those effects were proposed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412000375 PMCID: PMC3732475 PMID: 22781855 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Wang Z(1), Deater-Deckard K, Petrill SA, Thompson LA.	Author information: (1)Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061,  USA.	Previous research documented a robust link between difficulties in  self-regulation and development of externalizing problems (i.e., aggression and  delinquency). In this study, we examined the longitudinal additive and  interactive genetic and environmental covariation underlying this  well-established link using a twin design. The sample included 131 pairs of  monozygotic twins and 173 pairs of same-sex dizygotic twins who participated in  three waves of annual assessment. Mothers and fathers provided reports of  externalizing problems. Teacher report and observer rating were used to assess  twin's attention regulation. The etiology underlying the link between  externalizing problems and attention regulation shifted from a common genetic  mechanism to a common environmental mechanism in the transition across middle  childhood. Household chaos moderated the genetic variance of and covariance  between externalizing problems and attention regulation. The genetic influence  on individual differences in both externalizing problems and attention  regulation was stronger in more chaotic households. However, higher levels of  household chaos attenuated the genetic link between externalizing problems and  attention regulation.

Author information: (1)University of California, Irvine, CA, USA. candice.odgers@duke.edu	We report a graded relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES)  and children's antisocial behavior that (a) can be observed at school entry, (b)  widens across childhood, (c) remains after controlling for family-level SES and  risk, and (d) is completely mediated by maternal warmth and parental monitoring  (defined throughout as supportive parenting). The children were participants in  the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study (N = 2,232), which prospectively  tracked the development of children and their neighborhoods across childhood.  Direct and independent effects of neighborhood-level SES on children's  antisocial behavior were observed as early as age 5, and the gap between  children living in deprived versus more affluent neighborhoods widened as  children approached adolescence. By age 12, the effect of neighborhood SES on  children's antisocial behavior was as large as the effect observed for our most  robust predictor of antisocial behavior: sex (Cohen d = 0.51 when comparing  children growing up in deprived vs. more affluent neighborhoods in comparison to  Cohen d = 0.53 when comparing antisocial behavior among boys vs. girls).  However, these relatively large differences in children's levels and rate of  change in antisocial behavior across deprived versus more affluent neighborhoods  were completely mediated by supportive parenting practices. The implications of  our findings for studying and reducing socioeconomic disparities in antisocial  behavior among children are discussed.

Results revealed distinctive behavioral correlates of  dismissing versus preoccupied states of mind and emphasize the differential  predictive significance for developmental adaptation of attachment states of  mind versus adults' recollections of their early experiences.

Young BJ(1), Furman W, Jones MC.	Author information: (1)Mayo Clinic, USA.	Investigators have identified a number of factors that increase the risk for  experiencing sexual coercion, but as yet little is known about how sexual  coercion in turn affects these risk factors. Using a sample of 110 adolescents,  the current study examined the hypothesis that, after an incident of sexual  coercion, adolescents would exhibit increases in several behaviors known to  increase risk for victimization. As predicted, after experiencing sexual  coercion, adolescents reported increased externalizing symptoms, more frequent  sexual intercourse and a greater total number of intercourse partners. Finally,  alcohol use, drug use, and problems related to substance use increased. These  findings suggest the presence of a feedback loop, in which the experience of  sexual coercion leads to an intensification of the factors that initially  contributed risk for coercion.

Multimethod composites were created for personality traits, adversity exposure,  and adult outcomes of academic achievement, work, rule-abiding conduct,  friendship, and romantic relationships. Regressions showed significant main  effects of childhood personality predicting adult outcomes, controlling for  adversity, with few interaction effects. In person-focused analyses, the  resilient group in EA and YA (high competence, high adversity) showed higher  childhood conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness and lower neuroticism  than the maladaptive group (low competence, high adversity). The competent (high  competence, low adversity) and resilient groups showed similar childhood traits.  Turnaround cases, who changed from the maladaptive group in EA to the resilient  group in YA, exhibited higher childhood conscientiousness than persistently  maladaptive peers. Findings suggest that children on pathways to success in  adulthood, whether facing low or high adversity, have capacities for emotion  regulation, empathy and connection, dedication to schoolwork, and mastery and  exploration.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Vermont, 2 Colchester Avenue,  Burlington, VT 05405, USA. keith.burt@uvm.edu	The emerging adulthood years, commonly defined as the late teens and twenties,  represent a period of significant variability and change for much of the  population. Thus, it is important for the field to consider pathways of at-risk  youth as they move through this key window of development. We review research on  positive outcomes in the transition to adulthood following a history of  experienced adversity, including both investigations focused on resilience in  diverse specific populations as well as broader longitudinal studies. There is  compelling evidence for major protective and promotive factors identified in  younger age periods continuing to exert an influence at this stage of  development, along with evidence for new factors unique to this developmental  time and/or to specific populations. We conclude by noting recommendations for  future work in this area, emphasizing Garmezy's call for the testing of  competing models.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA.  tuppett.yates@ucr.edu	This investigation employed latent profile analysis to identify distinct  patterns of multiform competence among 164 emancipated foster youth (Mage =  19.67 years, SD = 1.12; 64% female). Fit indices and conceptual interpretation  converged on a four-profile solution. A subset of emancipated youth evidenced a  maladaptive profile (16.5%; n = 27), which was characterized by low educational  competence, low occupational competence, low civic engagement, problematic  interpersonal relationships, low self-esteem, and high depressive symptoms.  However, the largest group of emancipated youth exhibited a resilient profile in  which they were faring reasonably well in all domains despite marked adversity  (47%; n = 77). Two additional groups evidenced discordant adjustment patterns  wherein they exhibited high levels of psychological competence despite  behavioral difficulties (i.e., internally resilient; 30%; n = 49) or significant  emotional difficulties despite manifest competence (i.e., externally resilient;  6.5%; n = 11). The obtained profiles were validated against independent measures  of behavioral and socioemotional adjustment. Exploratory analyses examined  etiological differences across profiles with respect to child welfare variables,  such as age at entry into care, placement disruption, reason for placement, and  severity of child maltreatment. The findings highlight the need for  multidimensional models of risk and resilience and illustrate the importance of  heretofore underappreciated heterogeneity in the adaptive outcomes of  emancipated foster youth.

Change and reciprocity in adolescent aggressive and rule-breaking behaviors and  parental support and dysfunctional discipline.	de Haan AD(1), Prinzie P, Deković M.	Author information: (1)Department of Child and Adolescent Studies, Utrecht University, P.O. Box  80.140, Utrecht 3508 TC, The Netherlands. amarantadorothea.dehaan@ugent.be	This study examined how the development of aggressive/rule-breaking behaviors  (9-17 years) is related to the development of overreactive and warm parenting,  and explored gender differences in development and interrelations. Externalizing  was assessed using combined mother/father reports of the Child Behavior  Checklist (N = 516). Overreactivity was assessed using self-reports of the  Parenting Scale; warmth was measured using self-reports of the Parenting  Practices Questionnaire. All constructs were assessed three times across 6  years. The interrelated development of externalizing and parenting was examined  by cohort-sequential multigroup latent growth models. Timing of effects was  investigated using multigroup cross-lagged models. The results from latent  growth models suggest that boys and girls change similarly in the extent to  which they show externalizing behaviors, and indicate that mothers and fathers  show somewhat different parenting toward boys than girls. No gender differences  were found for interrelations between externalizing and parenting. Initial  levels of aggression were related to changes in overreactivity and warmth, and  vice versa. Changes in externalizing were related to changes in parenting.  Cross-lagged models showed that relations between overreactivity and  aggression/rule breaking were reciprocal. Together, results from this study show  that adolescent externalizing and parenting affect each other in important ways,  regardless of the gender of the child or the parent.

Author information: (1)Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine, Virginia  Commonwealth University, McGuire Hall, Room 216A, 1112 East Clay Street,  Richmond, VA 23298, USA. deadkins@vcu.edu	The influence of five monoamine candidate genes on depressive symptom  trajectories in adolescence and young adulthood were examined in the Add Health  genetic sample. Results indicated that, for all respondents, carriers of the  dopamine receptor D4 5-repeat allele were characterized by distinct depressive  symptom trajectories across adolescence and early adulthood. Similarly, for  males, individuals with the monoamine oxidase A 3.5-repeat allele exhibited  unique depressive symptom trajectories. Specifically, the trajectories of those  with the dopamine receptor D4 5-repeat allele were characterized by rising  levels in the transition to adulthood, while their peers were experiencing a  normative drop in depressive symptom frequency. Conversely, males with the  monoamine oxidase A 3.5-repeat allele were shown to experience increased  distress in late adolescence. An empirical method for examining a wide array of  allelic combinations was employed, and false discovery rate methods were used to  control the risk of false positives due to multiple testing. Special attention  was given to thoroughly interrogate the robustness of the putative genetic  effects. These results demonstrate the value of combining dynamic developmental  perspectives with statistical genetic methods to optimize the search for genetic  influences on psychopathology across the life course.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1747 West  Roosevelt Road, Chicago, IL 60608, USA. kheilman@psych.uic.edu	Cardiovascular response patterns to laboratory-based social and physical  exercise challenges were evaluated in 69 children and adolescents, 20 with  selective mutism (SM), to identify possible neurophysiological mechanisms that  may mediate the behavioral features of SM. Results suggest that SM is associated  with a dampened response of the vagal brake to physical exercise that is  manifested as reduced reactivity in heart rate and respiration. Polyvagal theory  proposes that the regulation of the vagal brake is a neurophysiological  component of an integrated social engagement system that includes the neural  regulation of the laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles. Within this theoretical  framework, sluggish vagal brake reactivity may parallel an inability to recruit  efficiently the structures involved in speech. Thus, the findings suggest that  dampened autonomic reactivity during mobilization behaviors may be a biomarker  of SM that can be assessed independent of the social stimuli that elicit mutism.

Author information: (1)Oregon State University Cascades Campus, 2600 NW College Way, Bend, OR 97701,  USA. shannon.lipscomb@osucascades.edu	The current study examines the interplay between parental overreactivity and  children's genetic backgrounds as inferred from birth parent characteristics on  the development of negative emotionality during infancy, and in turn, to  individual differences in externalizing problems in toddlerhood. The sample  included 361 families linked through adoption (birth parents and adoptive  families). Data were collected when the children were 9, 18, and 27 months old.  Results indicated links between individual levels and changes in negative  emotionality during infancy and toddlerhood to externalizing problems early in  the third year of life. Findings also revealed an interaction between birth  mother negative affect and adoptive mother overreactive parenting on children's  negative emotionality. This Genotype × Environment interaction predicted  externalizing problems indirectly through its association with negative  emotionality and revealed stronger effects of genetic risk for children with  less overreactive parenting from their mothers. Limitations of this study and  directions for future research are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579411000757 PMCID: PMC3270900 PMID: 22293002 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Timmer SG(1), Thompson D, Culver MA, Urquiza AJ, Altenhofen S.	Author information: (1)University of California Davis Children's Hospital, USA.  susan.timmer@ucdmc.ucdavis.edu	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of mothers' physical  abusiveness on the quality of the mother-child relationship, and note how it  further varied by their exposure to interparental violence (IPV). The sample  consisted of 232 clinic-referred children, aged 2 to 7 years, and their  biological mothers. Slightly more than a quarter of the children (N = 63, 27.2%)  had been physically abused by their mothers; approximately half of these  children also had a history of exposure to IPV (N = 34, 54%). Investigating  effects of physical abuse in the context of IPV history on mothers' and  children's emotional availability, we found that physically abused children with  no IPV exposure appeared less optimally emotionally available than physically  abused children with an IPV exposure. However, subsequent analyses showed that  although dyads with dual-violence exposure showed emotional availability levels  similar those of nonabusive dyads, they were more overresponsive and  overinvolving, a kind of caregiving controllingness charasteric of children with  disorganized attachment styles. These findings lend some support to the notion  that the effects of abuse on the parent-child relationship are influenced by the  context of family violence, although the effects appear to be complex.

Mothers' frontal EEG asymmetry in response to infant emotion states and  mother-infant emotional availability, emotional experience, and internalizing  symptoms.	Killeen LA(1), Teti DM.	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University, USA. lkilleen@partners.org	This study examined the links between mothers' frontal EEG asymmetry at rest and  during videos of their 5- to 8-month-old infants expressing three emotion states  (joy, anger/distress, and neutral interest), mother-infant emotional  availability (EA) in the home, mothers' depressive and anxious symptoms, and  mothers' emotional experience in response to infant emotion cues. Greater  relative right frontal activity at rest was associated with greater maternal  anxiety, but was unrelated to EA or mother-reported emotional experience in  response to infant emotion cues. A shift toward greater relative right frontal  activation in response to infant emotional stimuli was associated with lower  maternal anxiety, greater mother-infant EA, and mothers' experience of sadness,  concern, irritability, and the absence of joy in response to seeing their own  infant in distress. These findings suggest that mothers' in the moment  empathetic responding to their infant's emotions, indexed by a shift in frontal  EEG asymmetry in response to infant emotional displays, is related to  mother-infant EA in the home. Implications for conceptualizing parenting risk  are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579411000629 PMID: 22292990 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. dario@uchicago.edu	Allostatic load is the "wear and tear" of the body resulting from the repeated  activation of compensatory physiological mechanisms in response to chronic  stress. Allostatic load can significantly affect the aging process and result in  reduced longevity, accelerated aging, and impaired health. Although low  socioeconomic status is associated with high allostatic load during aging, the  effects of status-related psychosocial stress on allostatic load are often  confounded by lifestyle variables. Chronic psychosocial stress associated with  low dominance rank in nonhuman primates represents an excellent animal model  with which to investigate allostatic load and aging in humans. Research  conducted with free-ranging rhesus monkeys suggests that female reproduction can  also be a source of stress and allostatic load. Female reproduction is  associated with increased risk of mortality and hyperactivation of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Reproduction is especially stressful and  costly for aging females of low rank. Although many indicators of body condition  and neuroendocrine and immune function are influenced by aging, there are marked  and stable individual differences among aging females in body condition, plasma  cortisol responses to stress, and cytokine responses to stress. These  differences are consistent with the hypothesis that there are strong differences  in chronic stress among individuals, and that allostatic load resulting from  chronic stress affects health during aging. Comparisons between captive and  free-ranging rhesus monkey populations may allow us to understand how  differences in environmental stress and allostatic load affect rates of aging,  and how these in turn translate into differences in longevity and health.

Skinner ML(1), Shirtcliff EA, Haggerty KP, Coe CL, Catalano RF.	Author information: (1)University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98115, USA. skinnm@u.washington.edu	The concept of allostasis suggests that greater cumulative stress burden can  influence stress-responsive physiology. Dysregulation of allostatic mediators,  including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, is thought to precede  many other signs of age-related pathology as the persistent burden of stressors  accumulates over the individual's life span. We predicted that even in young  adulthood, HPA regulation would differ between Blacks and Whites, reflecting, in  part, higher rates of stressor exposure and greater potential for stressors to  "get under the skin." We examined whether stressor exposure, including  experiences with racism and discrimination, explained race differences in waking  cortisol and the diurnal rhythm. We also examined whether HPA functioning was  associated with mental health outcomes previously linked to cortisol. Salivary  cortisol was assayed in 275 young adults (127 Blacks, 148 Whites, 19 to 22 years  old), four times a day across 3 days. Hierarchical linear models revealed  flatter slopes for Blacks, reflecting significantly lower waking and higher  bedtime cortisol levels compared to Whites. Associations of HPA functioning with  stressors were typically more robust for Whites such that more stress exposure  created an HPA profile that resembled that of Black young adults. For Blacks,  greater stressor exposure did not further impact HPA functioning, or, when  significant, was often associated with higher cortisol levels. Across both  races, flatter slopes generally indicated greater HPA dysregulation and were  associated with poor mental health outcomes. These differential effects were  more robust for Whites. These findings support an allostatic model in which  social contextual factors influence normal biorhythms, even as early as young  adulthood.

Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14608, USA.  fred.rogosch@rochester.edu	Child maltreatment and biomarkers of allostatic load were investigated in  relation to child health problems and psychological symptomatology. Participants  attended a summer research day camp and included 137 maltreated and 110  nonmaltreated low-income children, who were aged 8 to 10 years (M = 9.42) and  racially and ethnically diverse; 52% were male. Measurements obtained included  salivary cortisol and dehydroepiandosterone, body mass index, waist-hip ratio,  and blood pressure; these indicators provided a composite index of allostatic  load. Child self-report and camp adult-rater reports of child symptomatology  were obtained; mothers provided information on health problems. The results  indicated that higher allostatic load and child maltreatment status  independently predicted poorer health outcomes and greater behavior problems.  Moderation effects indicated that allostatic load was related to somatic  complaints, attention problems, and thought problems only among maltreated  children. Risks associated with high waist-hip ratio, low morning cortisol, and  high morning dehydroepiandosterone also were related to depressive symptoms only  for maltreated children. The results support an allostatic load  conceptualization of the impact of high environmental stress and child abuse and  neglect on child health and behavioral outcomes and have important implications  for long-term physical and mental health.

Bush NR(1), Obradović J, Adler N, Boyce WT.	Author information: (1)University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94118, USA.  BushN@chc.ucsf.edu	Using an ethnically diverse longitudinal sample of 338 kindergarten children,  this study examined the effects of cumulative contextual stressors on children's  developing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis regulation as an  early life indicator of allostatic load. Chronic HPA axis regulation was  assessed using cumulative, multiday measures of cortisol in both the fall and  spring seasons of the kindergarten year. Hierarchical linear regression analyses  revealed that contextual stressors related to ethnic minority status,  socioeconomic status, and family adversity each uniquely predicted children's  daily HPA activity and that some of those associations were curvilinear in  conformation. Results showed that the quadratic, U-shaped influences of family  socioeconomic status and family adversity operate in different directions to  predict children's HPA axis regulation. Results further suggested that these  associations differ for White and ethnic minority children. In total, this study  revealed that early childhood experiences contribute to shifts in one of the  principal neurobiological systems thought to generate allostatic load,  confirming the importance of early prevention and intervention efforts.  Moreover, findings suggested that analyses of allostatic load and developmental  theories accounting for its accrual would benefit from an inclusion of  curvilinear associations in tested predictive models.

Childhood adversity and allostatic overload of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis: a vulnerability model for depressive  disorders.	Wilkinson PO(1), Goodyer IM.	Author information: (1)University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 8AH, UK. pow12@cam.ac.uk	Childhood adversity is associated with increased risk for onset of depressive  episodes. This review will present evidence that allostatic overload of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) partially mediates this association.  The HPAA is the physiological system that regulates levels of the stress hormone  cortisol. First, data from animals and humans has shown that early environmental  adversity is associated with long-term dysregulation of the HPAA. This may occur  due to permanent epigenetic modification of the glucocorticoid receptor. Second,  data from humans has demonstrated that HPAA dysregulation is associated with  increased risk of future depression onset in healthy individuals, and  pharmacological correction of HPAA dysregulation reduces depressive symptoms.  HPAA dysregulation may result in corticoid-mediated abnormalities in  neurogenesis in early life and/or neurotoxicity on neural systems that subserve  emotion and cognition.

Howell BR(1), Sanchez MM.	Author information: (1)Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA.	The mechanisms through which early life stress leads to psychopathology are  thought to involve allostatic load, the "wear and tear" an organism is subjected  to as a consequence of sustained elevated levels of glucocorticoids caused by  repeated/prolonged stress activations. The allostatic load model described this  phenomenon, but has been criticized as inadequate to explain alterations  associated with early adverse experience in some systems, including behavior,  which cannot be entirely explained from an energy balance perspective. The  reactive scope model has been more recently proposed and focuses less on energy  balance and more on dynamic ranges of physiological and behavioral mediators. In  this review we examine the mechanisms underlying the behavioral consequences of  early life stress in the context of both these models. We focus on adverse  experiences that involve mother-infant relationship disruption, and dissect  those mechanisms involving maternal care as a regulator of development of neural  circuits that control emotional and social behaviors in the offspring. We also  discuss the evolutionary purpose of the plasticity in behavioral development,  which has a clear adaptive value in a changing environment.

Author information: (1)University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. taylors@psych.ucla.edu	Adversity in childhood has effects on mental and physical health, not only in  childhood but across the lifespan. A chief task of our research has been to  define the pathways by which childhood experience has these surprising health  outcomes, often decades later. The concept of allostatic load, which refers to  dysregulations across major biological regulatory systems that have cumulative  interacting adverse effects over time, provides a mechanism for understanding  these relations and defining specific pathways. To chart these pathways, we  examine early childhood socioeconomic status, family environment, and genetic  predispositions as antecedents to socioemotional functioning/psychological  distress; and neural responses to threat that have downstream effects on major  stress regulatory systems, ultimately culminating in risks to mental and  physical health outcomes. This integrative approach to investigating the impact  of childhood experience on adult health outcomes illustrates the significance of  multilevel integrative approaches to understanding developmental psychopathology  more generally.

Author information: (1)University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. repetti@psych.ucla.edu	The concepts of allostatic load and allostatic processes can help psychologists  understand how health trajectories are influenced by stressful childhood  experiences in the family. This paper describes psychological pathways and two  key allostatic mediators, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the immune  system, through which stressful early rearing conditions may influence adult  mental and physical health. The action of meshed gears is introduced as a  metaphor to illustrate how responses occurring within a brief time frame, for  example, immediate reactions to stressors, can influence developmental and  health processes unfolding over much longer spans of time. We identify  early-developing psychological and biological response patterns that could link  chronic stressors in childhood to later health outcomes. Some of these  "precursor outcomes" (e.g., heightened vigilance and preparedness for threats;  enhanced inflammatory and humoral responses to infectious microorganisms) appear  to be aimed at protection from immediate dangers; they may reflect "adaptive  trade-offs" that balance short-term survival advantages under harsh rearing  conditions against disadvantages manifested later in development. Our analysis  also suggests mechanisms that underlie resilience in risky family environments.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941100040X PMID: 21756442 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Ross K(1), Martin T, Chen E, Miller GE.	Author information: (1)University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.  kmross@psych.ubc.ca	Research shows that poor social ties increase risks of morbidity and mortality  from cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, little is known about the nature of  everyday social encounters that give rise to this association, or when in the  course of development they begin to shape disease-relevant biological processes.  In this study, 122 adolescent females recorded the qualities of their everyday  social interactions using electronic diaries. At the same time we measured  components of the metabolic syndrome, a precursor to CVD that includes central  adiposity, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation.  Metabolic symptoms were reassessed 12 and 24 months later. Hierarchical linear  modeling revealed an association between negative social interactions and  metabolic symptom trajectories. To the extent that participants had more intense  negative social encounters in daily life, they showed increasing scores on a  composite indicator of metabolic risk over 2 years. This association was  independent of a variety of potential confounders, and persisted when symptoms  of depression and broader personality traits were controlled. There was no  association between positive social encounters and metabolic risk trajectories.  These findings suggest that even in otherwise healthy adolescents, abrasive  social encounters may accelerate the progression of early stages of CVD.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Denver. (#)Contributed equally	Although the majority of research attention to the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in stress-related disorders and as a  marker of allostatic load has focused on overactivation of this stress system,  theory and data clearly indicate that underactivation is also an important type  of dysregulation.

The first sample was comprised of 110 preschoolers living in high-stress  environments. Cortisol was assessed across the day at home and at child care as  well as across two stress paradigms. These data were used to classify whether  children's HPA axis activity was attenuated. Serious family financial strain,  maternal depression, and attenuated cortisol all made unique contributions in  models predicting current clinical levels of internalizing symptoms as rated by  mothers and teachers. The second sample was 166 third, sixth, and ninth graders  studied five times across a 1-year period. Maternal and child depression were  determined through structured clinical interviews, and stress exposure was  assessed via checklist and interview techniques with the child and parent.  Cortisol was assessed multiple times across a lab visit at Time 1, and these  data were combined into a single continuous measure. Cortisol concentrations  across the lab visit interacted with stress exposure across the year such that  children with lower average cortisol at Time 1 and increased stress across the  12 months showed elevated levels of internalizing symptoms. Based on these and  related data we propose that prior to puberty low cortisol may be an important  marker of allostatic load, particularly for risk of depression and anxiety.

Author information: (1)Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA. sdoan@bu.edu	A substantial amount of research has demonstrated the deleterious effects of  chronic stress on memory. However, much less is known about protective factors.  In the current study we test the role of maternal responsiveness in buffering  the effects of childhood allostatic load on subsequent adolescent working  memory. Allostatic load is a marker of cumulative stress on the body that is  caused by mobilization of multiple physiological systems in response to chronic  environmental demands. Results of the study suggest that allostatic load  negatively affects working memory, but that this effect is significantly  attenuated in children with responsive mothers.

Cicchetti D(1), Rogosch FA, Toth SL, Sturge-Apple ML.	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. cicchett@umn.edu	Longitudinal effects of child maltreatment on cortisol regulation in infants  from age 1 to 3 years were investigated in the context of a randomized  preventive intervention trial. Thirteen-month-old infants from maltreating  families (N = 91) and their mothers were randomly assigned to one of three  intervention conditions: child-parent psychotherapy, psychoeducational parenting  intervention, and a control group involving standard community services (CS). A  fourth group of infants from nonmaltreating families (N = 52) and their mothers  comprised a nonmaltreated comparison (NC) group. The two active interventions  were combined into one maltreated intervention (MI) group for statistical  analyses. Saliva samples were obtained from children at 10:00 a.m. before  beginning a laboratory observation session with their mothers when the children  were 13 months of age (preintervention), 19 months (midintervention), 26 months  (postintervention), and 38 months (1-year postintervention follow-up). At the  initial assessment, no significant differences among groups in morning cortisol  were observed. Latent growth curve analyses examined trajectories of cortisol  regulation over time. Beginning at midintervention, divergence was found among  the groups. Whereas the MI group remained indistinguishable from the NC group  across time, the CS group progressively evinced lower levels of morning  cortisol, statistically differing from the MI and NC groups. Results highlight  the value of psychosocial interventions for early child maltreatment in  normalizing biological regulatory processes.

Joint trajectories for social and physical aggression as predictors of  adolescent maladjustment: internalizing symptoms, rule-breaking behaviors, and  borderline and narcissistic personality features.	Underwood MK(1), Beron KJ, Rosen LH.	Author information: (1)School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, 800  West Campbell Road, GR 41, Richardson, TX 75080, USA. undrwd@utdallas.edu	This investigation examined the relation between developmental trajectories  jointly estimated for social and physical aggression and adjustment problems at  age 14. Teachers provided ratings of children's social and physical aggression  in Grades 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 for a sample of 255 children (131 girls, 21% African  American, 52% European American, 21% Mexican American). Participants, parents,  and teachers completed measures of the adolescent's adjustment to assess  internalizing symptoms, rule-breaking behaviors, and borderline and narcissistic  personality features. Results showed that membership in a high and rising  trajectory group predicted rule-breaking behaviors and borderline personality  features. Membership in a high desister group predicted internalizing symptoms,  rule-breaking behaviors, and borderline and narcissistic personality features.  The findings suggest that although low levels of social and physical aggression  may not bode poorly for adjustment, individuals engaging in high levels of  social and physical aggression in middle childhood may be at greatest risk for  adolescent psychopathology, whether they increase or desist in their aggression  through early adolescence.

El-Sheikh M(1), Erath SA.	Author information: (1)Department of Human Development and Family Studies, 203 Spidle Hall, Auburn  University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA. elshemm@auburn.edu	The family is one of the primary contexts of child development. Marital and  parent-child conflict (family conflict) are common and predict a wide range of  negative behavioral and emotional outcomes in children. Thus, an important task  for developmental researchers is to identify the processes through which family  conflict contributes to children's psychological maladjustment, as well as  vulnerability and protective factors in the context of family conflict. In the  current paper, we aim to advance a conceptual model that focuses on indices of  children's autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning that increase  vulnerability or provide protection against psychological maladjustment in the  context of family conflict. In doing so, we provide a selective review that  reflects the state of the science linking family conflict, children's ANS  activity, and child psychological adjustment, and offer directions and guidance  for future research. Our hope is to accelerate research at the intersection of  family conflict and ANS functioning to advance understanding of risk and  resilience among children.

Author information: (1)Department of Child Development and Family Studies, 101 Gates Road, Purdue  University, West Lafayette, IN 47906, USA. Hibel@purdue.edu	This study prospectively examined the effect of intimate partner violence (IPV)  on adrenocortical reactivity and recovery during early childhood. The sample (n  = 1102 mother-infant dyads; 49.2% male) was racially diverse and from  predominantly low-income, rural communities. To measure IPV exposure mothers  completed the Conflicts Tactics Scale, and her caretaking behaviors were  observed when her child was approximately 7, 15, and 24 months of age.  Children's saliva samples, later assayed for cortisol, were collected around  challenge tasks designed to elicit emotional reactivity. IPV was related to a  trajectory of increased cortisol reactivity from infancy to toddlerhood. By  contrast, the trajectory for non-IPV-exposed children decreased in cortisol  reactivity across 7 to 24 months of age. At the 24-month assessment, on average,  toddlers did not exhibit a cortisol reaction; however, those exposed to high  levels of violence continued to have reactivity. Accumulative levels of IPV  across the first 2 years of life predicted cortisol reactivity at 24 months of  age. Early (7-month) sensitive maternal behavior moderated this relationship, so  that only children exposed to both early insensitivity and high accumulated IPV  exhibited increased reactivity at the 24-month assessment. Findings are  discussed in relation to the risky family framework.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579411000010 PMID: 23786704 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Connecticut, 406 Babbidge Road, Unit  1020, Storrs, CT 06269, USA. inge-marie.eigsti@uconn.edu	This study focuses on the association between language skills and core cognitive  processes relative to the duration of institutionalization in children adopted  from orphanages abroad. Participants in the adoptive group (n = 46) had arrived  in the United States between the ages of 2 and 84 months (mean = 24 months), and  had been living in the United States for 1-9 years. Drawing on both experimental  and standardized assessments, language skills of the international adoptees  differed as a function of length of time spent in an institution and from those  of 24 nonadopted controls. Top-down cognitive assessments including measures of  explicit memory and cognitive control differed between adopted and nonadopted  children, yet differences between groups in bottom-up implicit learning  processes were unremarkable. Based on the present findings, we propose a  speculative model linking language and cognitive changes to underlying neural  circuitry alterations that reflect the impact of chronic stress, due to  adoptees' experience of noncontingent, nonindividualized caregiving. Thus, the  present study provides support for a relationship between domain-general  cognitive processes and language acquisition, and describes a potential  mechanism by which language skills are affected by institutionalization.

Children's genotypes interact with maternal responsive care in predicting  children's competence: diathesis-stress or differential susceptibility?	Kochanska G(1), Kim S, Barry RA, Philibert RA.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242-1407, USA.  grazyna-kochanska@uiowa.edu	We examined Genotype × Environment (G × E) interactions between children's  genotypes (the serotonin transporter linked promoter region [5-HTTLPR] gene) and  maternal responsive care observed at 15, 25, 38, and 52 months on three aspects  of children's competence at 67 months: academic skills and school engagement,  social functioning with peers, and moral internalization that encompassed  prosocial moral cognition and the moral self. Academic and social competence  outcomes were reported by both parents, and moral internalization was observed  in children's narratives elicited by hypothetical stories and in a puppet  interview. Analyses revealed robust G × E interactions, such that children's  genotype moderated the effects of maternal responsive care on all aspects of  children's competence. Among children with a short 5-HTTLPR allele (ss/sl),  those whose mothers were more responsive were significantly more competent than  those whose mothers were less responsive. Responsiveness had no effect for  children with two long alleles (ll). For academic and social competence, the G ×  E interactions resembled the diathesis-stress model: ss/sl children of  unresponsive mothers had particularly unfavorable outcomes, but ss/sl children  of responsive mothers had no worse outcomes than ll children. For moral  internalization, the G × E interaction reflected the differential susceptibility  model: whereas ss/sl children of unresponsive mothers again had particularly  unfavorable outcomes, ss/sl children of responsive mothers had significantly  better outcomes than ll children.

A resting EEG study of 329 preschoolers.	Shankman SA(1), Klein DN, Torpey DC, Olino TM, Dyson MW, Kim J, Durbin CE,  Nelson BD, Tenke CE.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1007 West  Harrison, Chicago, IL 60607, USA. stewarts@uic.edu	Researchers have long been interested in whether particular temperamental traits  in childhood connote risk for depressive disorders. For example, children  characterized as having high negative emotionality (NE; sadness, fear, anger)  and low positive emotionality (PE; anhedonia, listlessness, and lack of  enthusiasm) are hypothesized to be at risk for depression. Few studies, however,  have examined whether (and how) these two temperamental dimensions interact to  confer risk. In a sample of 329 preschoolers, the present study addressed this  question by examining the relation between PE and NE and asymmetry in resting  EEG activity in frontal and posterior regions, which are putative biomarkers for  depression. Using a laboratory battery to define temperament, we found an  interaction of PE and NE on posterior asymmetry. Specifically, when PE was high,  NE was associated with greater relative right activity. When PE was low, NE was  not related to posterior asymmetry. These results were driven by differences in  EEG activity in right posterior regions, an area associated with emotional  processing and arousal, and were specific to girls. We found no relation between  temperament and frontal asymmetry. These findings suggest that, at least for  girls, PE and NE may have an interactive effect on risk for depression.

Author information: (1)Research Institute on Addictions, 1021 Main Street, University at Buffalo,  Buffalo, NY 14203, USA. eiden@ria.buffalo.edu	This study examined the role of maternal psychopathology and maternal warmth as  mediators of the association between prenatal cocaine and other substance  exposure and toddler behavior problems. It was also hypothesized that infant  cortisol reactivity and environmental risk may moderate these associations.  Participants were 220 caregiver-infant dyads (119 cocaine exposed, 101 not  cocaine exposed; 49% boys). Mother-infant dyads were recruited at delivery with  assessments at 4-8 weeks and 7, 13, and 18 months of child ages. Results yielded  no direct associations between prenatal cocaine/other substance exposure and  toddler behavior problems, but significant indirect associations between  prenatal cigarette/alcohol exposure and toddler behavior problems at 18 months.  With regard to moderation, results indicated an indirect association between  prenatal cocaine exposure and toddler behavior problems via lower maternal  warmth for children with higher, but not lower, cortisol reactivity at 7 months.  Results suggest potential pathways to toddler behavior problems among children  at high biological risk.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579411000058 PMCID: PMC3695418 PMID: 23786694 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Masten AS(1).	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, 51 East River Parkway, University of  Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. amasten@umn.edu	This article delineates parallel frameworks that grew out of the research on  risk and resilience over the past four decades, a framework for research and a  framework for practice, and then discusses the promise of an emerging synthesis.  The research framework defined the meaning, models, and methods that  successfully guided four waves of research to date on the nature and processes  involved in human resilience. The applied framework emerged in response to  urgent needs of children and families faced by adversity and those charged with  helping them, resulting in guidelines for translating the unfolding but  incomplete research evidence into action. The application of a resilience  approach transformed practice in many fields concerned with promoting resilience  in people at risk for problems, revolutionizing the mission, models, measures,  and methods of practice to align with the emphasis on positive adaptation and  strengths defining a resilience-based approach. Yet these interventions rarely  translated back to inform and refine resilience theory in ways that would  accelerate progress to promote resilience more effectively. The concluding  section on translational synergy discusses the potential for a synthesis of  basic and applied resilience frameworks as the next steps toward realizing the  original objective and promise of resilience science.

Association between childhood maltreatment and adult emotional dysregulation in  a low-income, urban, African American sample: moderation by oxytocin receptor  gene.

Author information: (1)Atlanta VA Medical Center, Decatur, GA 30033, USA. rbradl2@emory.edu	The ability to effectively regulate emotions and a secure attachment style are  critical for maintaining mental health across the life span. The experience of  childhood maltreatment interferes with normal development of emotional  regulation and dramatically increases risk for a wide range of psychiatric  disorders in adulthood. The central nervous system oxytocin systems are  critically involved in mediating social attachment and buffering  psychophysiological responses to stress. We therefore investigated the impact of  childhood maltreatment and an oxytocin receptor (OXTR) single nucleotide  polymorphism (rs53576) and their interaction on emotional dysregulation and  attachment style in adulthood in a sample of low-income, African American men  and women recruited from primary care clinics of an urban, public hospital.  Consistent with prior research, we found that the severity of childhood  maltreatment was associated with increased levels of emotional dysregulation in  adulthood. Childhood maltreatment was also positively associated with ratings of  disorganized/unresolved adult attachment style and negatively associated with  ratings of secure adult attachment style. There was no direct association  between rs53576 and emotional dysregulation or ratings of adult attachment  style. However, there were significant interactions between rs53576 and  childhood maltreatment in predicting level of adult emotional dysregulation and  attachment style. Specifically, G/G genotype carriers were at risk for increased  emotional dysregulation when exposed to three or more categories of childhood  abuse. In addition, G/G genotype carriers exhibited enhanced disorganized adult  attachment style when exposed to severe childhood abuse compared to A/A and A/G  carriers. Our findings suggest that A allele carriers of OXTR rs53576 are  resilient against the effects of severe childhood adversity, by protection  against emotional dysregulation and disorganized attachment.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, San  Francisco, CA 94143-0852, USA. alicia.lieberman@ucsf.edu	Children in the birth to 5 age range are disproportionately exposed to traumatic  events relative to older children, but they are underrepresented in the trauma  research literature as well as in the development and implementation of  effective clinical treatments and in public policy initiatives to protect  maltreated children. Children from ethnic minority groups and those living in  poverty are particularly affected. This paper discusses the urgent need to  address the needs of traumatized young children and their families through  systematic research, clinical, and public policy initiatives, with specific  attention to underserved groups. The paper reviews research findings on early  childhood maltreatment and trauma, including the role of parental functioning,  the intergenerational transmission of trauma and psychopathology, and protective  contextual factors in young children's response to trauma exposure. We describe  the therapeutic usefulness of a simultaneous treatment focus on current  traumatic experiences and on the intergenerational transmission of relational  patterns from parent to child. We conclude with a discussion of the implications  of current knowledge about trauma exposure for clinical practice and public  policy and with recommendations for future research.

Affective facial expression processing in young children who have experienced  maltreatment during the first year of life: an event-related potential study.	Curtis WJ(1), Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Kentucky, 207C Kastle Hall,  Lexington, KY 40506, USA. john.curtis@uky.edu	This study employed event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the neural  correlates of facial affect processing in maltreated and nonmaltreated children  at 42 months of age. ERPs elicited while children passively viewed standardized  pictures of female models posing angry, happy, and neutral facial expressions  were examined, and differences between maltreated (N = 46) and nonmaltreated (N  = 25) children were reported. Three occipital components (P1, N170, and P400)  and four frontal-central components (N150, P240, Nc, and a positive slow wave  [PSW]) were identified. Findings revealed that maltreated children had greater  P1 and P400 amplitude in response to angry facial affect compared to other  emotions, and compared to nonmaltreated children. N170 amplitude was greater in  response to happy compared to angry in the maltreated group. For the P240  component, maltreated children had greater amplitude in response to angry facial  expressions relative to happy, whereas children in the nonmaltreated group had  greater P240 amplitude in response to happy relative to angry facial affect.  Further, the nonmaltreated group had greater PSW amplitude in response to angry  facial affect, whereas those in the maltreated group showed greater PSW  amplitude to happy facial expressions. The results provided further support for  the hypothesis that the experience of maltreatment and the predominantly  negative emotional tone in maltreating families alters the functioning of neural  systems associated with the identification and processing of facial emotion.  These results exemplify the importance of early preventive interventions focused  on emotion for children who have experienced maltreatment early in life.

Author information: (1)Addiction Research Center and Substance Abuse Section, Department of  Psychiatry, University of Michigan, 4250 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48109,  USA. buu@umich.edu	In a sample of 273 adult women and their families, we examined the effects of  women's psychopathology history, their social support, their husbands' and  children's symptomatology, family stress, and neighborhood environment on their  alcohol problems, antisocial behavior, and depression over a 12-year period  during their 30s and early 40s. Women's alcohol problems and antisocial behavior  decreased but their depression symptoms increased over time. Women's disorder  history and their partners' parallel symptomatology were associated with their  symptoms. For women's antisocial behavior, their own history of alcoholism and  their partners' alcohol problems were also significant risk factors. Higher  levels of social support were associated with lower levels of depression in  women. Children's externalizing behavior was positively correlated with their  mothers' alcohol problems and antisocial behavior, whereas children's  internalizing behavior was positively correlated with their mothers' depression.  Neighborhood residential instability was associated with higher levels of  alcoholic and depressive symptomatology in women. Intervention efforts might  target women with young children by improving social support, educational or  professional training opportunity, access to family counseling, and neighborhood  environment.

Individual differences in the development of early peer aggression: integrating  contributions of self-regulation, theory of mind, and parenting.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, 530 Church Street, Ann  Arbor, MI 48109, USA. slolson@umich.edu	This prospective longitudinal study focused on self-regulatory,  social-cognitive, and parenting precursors of individual differences in  children's peer-directed aggression at early school age. Participants were 199  3-year-old boys and girls who were reassessed following the transition to  kindergarten (5.5-6 years). Peer aggression was assessed in preschool and school  settings using naturalistic observations and teacher reports. Children's  self-regulation abilities and theory of mind understanding were assessed during  a laboratory visit, and parenting risk (corporal punishment and low  warmth/responsiveness) was assessed using interview-based and questionnaire  measures. Individual differences in children's peer aggression were moderately  stable across the preschool to school transition. Preschool-age children who  manifested high levels of aggressive peer interactions also showed lower levels  of self-regulation and theory of mind understanding, and experienced higher  levels of adverse parenting than others. Our main finding was that early  corporal punishment was associated with increased levels of peer aggression  across the transition from preschool to school, as was the interaction between  low maternal emotional support and children's early delays in theory of mind  understanding. These data highlight the need for family-directed preventive  efforts during the early preschool years.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000775 PMCID: PMC4100535 PMID: 21262052 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Changes in genetic and environmental influences on the development of nicotine  dependence and major depressive disorder from middle adolescence to early  adulthood.	Tully EC(1), Iacono WG, McGue M.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30302-5010,  USA. etully2@gsu.edu	This longitudinal study used a representative community sample of same-sex twins  (485 monozygotic pairs, 271 dizygotic pairs) to study longitudinal changes in  genetic and environmental influences on nicotine dependence (NicD) symptoms and  major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms and the longitudinal relationships  between NicD and MDD symptoms at three relatively discrete ages spanning middle  adolescence to early adulthood (ages 15, 18, and 21). Clinical interviews were  used to assess NicD and MDD symptoms lifetime at age 15 and during the previous  3 years at the two subsequent assessments. Biometric models revealed similar  patterns of findings for NicD and MDD. Heritability increased with age,  particularly between ages 15 and 18. Shared environmental influences were small,  and the proportion of variance attributed to shared environmental influences  decreased with age. Nonshared environmental influences were moderate to large in  magnitude and were entirely age specific. Both NicD and MDD symptoms showed  considerable stability from age 15 to 21, and at each age those with one  disorder showed elevated rates of the other. However, a cross-lagged model  revealed no longitudinal predictive relationships between MDD symptoms and NicD  symptoms after accounting for stability of symptoms within disorders. In  summary, the transition between middle and late adolescence is a critical period  for developmental shifts in the magnitudes of genetic and environmental  influences on both MDD and NicD symptoms. Despite similarities in the  development of genetic and environmental influences for the two phenotypes, the  association between NicD and MDD reflects concurrent covariation rather than one  phenotype being an antecedent influence on the subsequent development of the  other.

Author information: (1)Prevention Research Center, Psychology North, Arizona State University,  Tempe, AZ 85287-6005, USA. darya.bonds@asu.edu	Using data from a 6-year longitudinal follow-up sample of 240 youth who  participated in a randomized experimental trial of a preventive intervention for  divorced families with children ages 9-12, the current study tested alternative  cascading pathways by which the intervention decreased symptoms of internalizing  disorders, symptoms of externalizing disorders, substance use, and risky sexual  behavior and increased self-esteem and academic performance in mid- to late  adolescence (15-19 years old). It was hypothesized that the impact of the  program on adolescent adaptation outcomes would be explained by progressive  associations between program-induced changes in parenting and youth adaptation  outcomes. The results supported a cascading model of program effects in which  the program was related to increased mother-child relationship quality that was  related to subsequent decreases in child internalizing problems, which then was  related to subsequent increases in self-esteem and decreases in symptoms of  internalizing disorders in adolescence. The results were also consistent with a  model in which the program increased maternal effective discipline that was  related to decreased child externalizing problems, which was related to  subsequent decreases in symptoms of externalizing disorders, less substance use,  and better academic performance in adolescence. There were no significant  differences in the model based on level of baseline risk or adolescent gender.  These results provide support for a cascading pathways model of child and  adolescent development.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000453 PMCID: PMC2950317 PMID: 20883581 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Bukowski WM(1), Laursen B, Hoza B.	Author information: (1)Concordia University, Department of Psychology and Centre de Recherche en  Développement Humain, 7141 Rue Sherbrooke Ouest, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  william.bukowski@concordia.ca	A three-wave longitudinal study conducted with preadolescent boys and girls (N =  231 at Time 1 [T1]) was used to assess the hypotheses that aspects of social  withdrawal would be predictors of a "snowball" cascade of depressed affect, and  that friendship experiences would moderate these effects. Consistent with these  hypotheses, multilevel modeling showed that measures of avoidance and exclusion  at T1 were associated with concurrent levels of depressed affect and were  antecedent to escalating trajectories of depressed affect over time. These  accelerating growth curves fit a snowball cascade model. The analyses also  showed the protective effects of friendship. Specifically, the snowball effect  was limited to avoidant and excluded children who were friendless. Depressed  affect did not increase among avoidant and excluded children who were friended.

Author information: (1)Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development, National Institutes of Health, 6705 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD  20892-7971, USA. marc_h_bornstein@nih.gov	This study used a three-wave longitudinal design to investigate developmental  cascades among social competence and externalizing and internalizing behavioral  adjustment in a normative sample of 117 children seen at 4, 10, and 14 years.  Children, mothers, and teachers provided data. A series of nested path analysis  models was used to determine the most parsimonious and plausible cascades across  the three constructs over and above their covariation at each age and stability  across age. Children with lower social competence at age 4 years exhibited more  externalizing and internalizing behaviors at age 10 years and more externalizing  behaviors at age 14 years. Children with lower social competence at age 4 years  also exhibited more internalizing behaviors at age 10 years and more  internalizing behaviors at age 14 years. Children who exhibited more  internalizing behaviors at age 4 years exhibited more internalizing behaviors at  age 10 years and more externalizing behaviors at age 14 years. These cascades  among social competence and behavioral adjustment obtained independent of child  intelligence and maternal education and social desirability of responding.

Author information: (1)Center for Family Research, University of Georgia, 1095 College Station Road,  Athens, GA 30602-4527, USA. gbrody@uga.edu	A three-wave cascade model linking life stress to increases in risk behavior was  tested with 347 African American emerging adults living in the rural South. Data  analyses using structural equation modeling and latent growth curve modeling  demonstrated that life stress was linked to increases in risk behavior as  African Americans transitioned out of secondary school. The cascade model  indicated that life stress fostered increases in negative emotions. Negative  emotions, in turn, were linked to increases in affiliations with deviant peers  and romantic partners; this forecast increases in risk behavior. The findings  supported a stress proliferation framework, in which primary stressors affect  increases in secondary stressors that carry forward to influence changes in risk  behaviors that can potentially compromise mental health.

Developmental cascades: externalizing, internalizing, and academic competence  from middle childhood to early adolescence.	Moilanen KL(1), Shaw DS, Maxwell KL.	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh, USA. klmoilanen@mail.wvu.edu	The current study was initiated to increase understanding of developmental  cascades in childhood in a sample of at-risk boys (N = 291; 52% White). Mothers,  teachers, and boys reported on boys' externalizing problems, internalizing  difficulties, and academic competence. Consistent with hypotheses regarding  school-related transitions, high levels of externalizing problems were  associated with both low levels of academic competence and high levels of  internalizing problems during the early school-age period, and with elevations  in internalizing problems during the transition to adolescence. Low levels of  academic competence were associated with high levels of internalizing problems  in middle childhood, and with high levels of externalizing problems during the  transition from elementary school to middle school. Shared risk factors played a  minimal role in these developmental cascades. Results suggest that there are  cascading effects of externalizing problems and academic competence in childhood  and early adolescence, and that some cascading effects are more likely to occur  during periods of school-related transitions. Implications of developmental  cascade effects for research and intervention are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000337 PMCID: PMC3168570 PMID: 20576184 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Developmental cascades of peer relations and symptoms of externalizing and  internalizing problems from kindergarten to fourth-grade elementary school.	van Lier PA(1), Koot HM.	Author information: (1)Department of Developmental Psychology, VU University Amsterdam, Van der  Boechorststraat 1, 1081 BT Amsterdam, The Netherlands. pac.van.lier@psy.vu.nl	A developmental cascade model linking symptoms of externalizing and  internalizing psychopathology through three indices of peer relational  difficulty (peer rejection, peer victimization, friendedness) was tested in a  general population sample of 653 children followed annually from kindergarten to  fourth grade. Rejection and victimization linked kindergarten externalizing  problems with fourth-grade internalizing problems. Transactional links between  rejection and victimization were found. In addition, peer rejection added to the  development of externalizing problems. Friendedness did not add to the  development of externalizing or internalizing problems. Cascade paths were  similar for boys and girls. Over the period of kindergarten to fourth grade,  psychopathology and peer relations become entangled, and the dynamic interplay  between multiple manifestations of poor peer relations ultimately adds to the  development of both externalizing and internalizing problems and their  cross-time relation. Implications for research and prevention are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000283 PMID: 20576179 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Human Development, Vanderbilt University,  Nashville, TN, USA. chrystyna.kouros@vanderbilt.edu	Consistent with developmental cascade notions, the present study investigated  (a) associations between trajectories of interparental conflict and early  externalizing problems during childhood and (b) early trajectories of  externalizing problems as a pathway by which interparental conflict impacts  children's social competence in preadolescence. Participants were 235 children  and their parents and teachers. Children were assessed annually for 3 years,  beginning when they were in kindergarten. Parents provided reports of  interparental conflict and child externalizing problems. Children's social  competence (prosocial behavior, social problems) was assessed approximately 5  years later via parent and teacher reports. Results from parallel process models  indicated that changes in interparental conflict were positively associated with  changes in externalizing problems during childhood. Further, demonstrating  pathways consistent with notions of developmental cascades, early trajectories  of externalizing problems accounted for the longitudinal link between early  trajectories of interparental conflict and children's social problems in  preadolescence.

Author information: (1)Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims, Copenhagen, Denmark.  em@rct.dk	The aim of the present study was to assess and understand the long-term  trajectory of psychological problems among young Middle Eastern refugees in  Denmark. Participants were 131 young refugees from the Middle East (76 girls, 55  boys; mean age = 15.3 years) from 67 families. They were assessed first on  arrival in Denmark in 1992-1993 and again 8-9 years later. The high prevalence  of psychological problems at arrival was considerably reduced by the time of  follow-up, but it was still somewhat higher than what has been found in most  community studies using the same assessment tools. Groups of children differed  in showing low levels of symptoms at arrival that were stable (spared) or  increased (reacting) and high levels at arrival that persisted (traumatized) or  decreased (adapted). The number of types of traumatic experiences before arrival  distinguished the spared and the traumatized young refugees and the number of  types of stressful events after arrival the adapted and the traumatized, also  after corrections for age, sex, specific traumatic events, parents' education  and health, and the social situation of the young refugees. The study emphasizes  the importance of environmental factors for healthy long-term adaptation after  traumatic experiences related to war and other organized violence.

Author information: (1)Methodology Center, Pennsylvania State University, 204 East Calder Way, Suite  400, State College, PA 16801, USA. slanza@psu.edu	This study identified profiles of 13 risk factors across child, family, school,  and neighborhood domains in a diverse sample of children in kindergarten from  four US locations (n = 750; 45% minority). It then examined the relation of  those early risk profiles to externalizing problems, school failure, and low  academic achievement in Grade 5. A person-centered approach, latent class  analysis, revealed four unique risk profiles, which varied considerably across  urban African American, urban White, and rural White children. Profiles  characterized by several risks that cut across multiple domains conferred the  highest risk for negative outcomes. Compared to a variable-centered approach,  such as a cumulative risk index, these findings provide a more nuanced  understanding of the early precursors to negative outcomes. For example, results  suggested that urban children in single-parent homes that have few other risk  factors (i.e., show at least average parenting warmth and consistency and report  relatively low stress and high social support) are at quite low risk for  externalizing problems, but at relatively high risk for poor grades and low  academic achievement. These findings provide important information for refining  and targeting preventive interventions to groups of children who share  particular constellations of risk factors.

Transitioning to adolescence: how changes in child personality and overreactive  parenting predict adolescent adjustment problems.	van den Akker AL(1), Deković M, Prinzie P.	Author information: (1)Department of Child and Adolescent Studies, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The  Netherlands. A.L.vandenAkker@uu.nl	The present study examined how changes in child Big Five personality  characteristics and overreactive parenting during the transition from childhood  to adolescence predict adolescent adjustment problems. The sample included 290  children, aged 8-9 years. At three moments, with 2-year intervals, mothers,  fathers, and a teacher reported on the child's personality, and mothers and  fathers reported on their parenting behavior. At the third measurement moment,  mothers, fathers, and children reported on the child's adjustment problems.  Rank-order stability of the personality dimensions and overreactive parenting  were high. Univariate latent growth models revealed mean-level decreases for  extraversion, conscientiousness, and imagination. Mean levels of benevolence,  emotional stability, and overreactive parenting were stable. Multivariate latent  growth models revealed that decreases in extraversion and emotional stability  predicted internalizing problems, whereas decreases in benevolence,  conscientiousness, and emotional stability predicted externalizing problems.  Increases in overreactive parenting predicted externalizing, but not  internalizing problems. The associations were similar for boys and girls. The  results indicate that changes in child personality and overreactive parenting  during the transition to adolescence are associated with adolescent adjustment  problems. Overall, child personality was more important than overreactive  parenting, and children were more likely to "act out" than to "withdraw" in  reaction to overreactive parenting.

Cyr C(1), Euser EM, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, Van Ijzendoorn MH.	Author information: (1)Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands. chantal.cyr.psy@videotron.ca	The current meta-analytic study examined the differential impact of maltreatment  and various socioeconomic risks on attachment security and disorganization.  Fifty-five studies with 4,792 children were traced, yielding 59 samples with  nonmaltreated high-risk children (n = 4,336) and 10 samples with maltreated  children (n = 456). We tested whether proportions of secure versus insecure  (avoidant, resistant, and disorganized) and organized versus disorganized  attachments varied as a function of risks. Results showed that children living  under high-risk conditions (including maltreatment studies) showed fewer secure  (d = 0.67) and more disorganized (d = 0.77) attachments than children living in  low-risk families. Large effects sizes were found for the set of maltreatment  studies: maltreated children were less secure (d = 2.10) and more disorganized  (d = 2.19) than other high-risk children (d = 0.48 and d = 0.48, respectively).  However, children exposed to five socioeconomic risks (k = 8 studies, d = 1.20)  were not significantly less likely to be disorganized than maltreated children.  Overall, these meta-analyses show the destructive impact of maltreatment for  attachment security as well as disorganization, but the accumulation of  socioeconomic risks appears to have a similar impact on attachment  disorganization.

Serotonin pathway gene-gene and gene-environment interactions influence  behavioral stress response in infant rhesus macaques.	Kinnally EL(1), Karere GM, Lyons LA, Mendoza SP, Mason WA, Capitanio JP.	Author information: (1)University of California Davis, USA. ek2500@columbia.edu	A subset of serotonin (5-HT) pathway polymorphisms has been shown to confer risk  for psychological dysfunction, particularly in individuals who experience early  adversity. Understanding the developmental processes underlying these Gene x  Environment interactions will strengthen the search for risk factors for  behavioral dysfunction. We investigated the combined influence of two serotonin  pathway polymorphisms and species-atypical, and possibly adverse, rearing  (nursery rearing [NR]) on two dimensions of behavioral stress response in infant  rhesus macaques. We hypothesized that the experience of NR and possession of  both "high-risk" genotypes (genotypes that are thought to confer low 5-HT  function) would predict the greatest behavioral stress response to  maternal/social separation. Using a matched-pair design, the impact of early  experience and the serotonin transporter (rh5-HTTLPR) and monoamine oxidase A  (rhMAO-A-LPR) promoter polymorphisms on behavioral reactivity of 136 infant  rhesus macaques (90-120 days of age) during a 25-hr social separation/relocation  procedure was assessed. Each pair included one infant reared with mother in a  large, outdoor field enclosure (field rearing) and one infant reared in a  nursery (NR). Pairs were matched for putative gene activity of each  polymorphism, sex, age, and weight at testing. Behavioral responses in a "human  intruder" test were recorded, and activity and emotional reactivity composites  were created to detect different aspects of psychological adaptation to stress.  Our hypothesis that high-risk groups would be the most reactive to stress was  not entirely borne out. Rh5-HTTLPR x rhMAOA-LPR interactions predicted emotional  reactivity and tended to predict behavioral activity scores. Carriers of the two  "low-risk" alleles exhibited the lowest behavioral activity, as might be  predicted, but carriers of both "high-risk" alleles were two of four genotype  groups exhibiting the highest observed Emotional Reactivity. Gene x Gene  interactions were exacerbated by the experience of nursery rearing, as  predicted, however. Finally, we suggest that genetic or environmental factors  may mitigate the risk for behavioral dysregulation illustrated in the patterns  of behavioral activity and emotional reactivity displayed by infants.

Fonagy P(1), Luyten P.	Author information: (1)Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology,  University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, UK. p.fonagy@ucl.ac.uk	The precise nature and etiopathogenesis of borderline personality disorder (BPD)  continues to elude researchers and clinicians. Yet, increasing evidence from  various strands of research converges to suggest that affect dysregulation,  impulsivity, and unstable relationships constitute the core features of BPD.  Over the last two decades, the mentalization-based approach to BPD has attempted  to provide a theoretically consistent way of conceptualizing the  interrelationship between these core features of BPD, with the aim of providing  clinicians with a conceptually sound and empirically supported approach to BPD  and its treatment. This paper presents an extended version of this approach to  BPD based on recently accumulated data. In particular, we suggest that the core  features of BPD reflect impairments in different facets of mentalization, each  related to impairments in relatively distinct neural circuits underlying these  facets. Hence, we provide a comprehensive account of BPD by showing how its core  features are related to each other in theoretically meaningful ways. More  specifically, we argue that BPD is primarily associated with a low threshold for  the activation of the attachment system and deactivation of controlled  mentalization, linked to impairments in the ability to differentiate mental  states of self and other, which lead to hypersensitivity and increased  susceptibility to contagion by other people's mental states, and poor  integration of cognitive and affective aspects of mentalization. The combination  of these impairments may explain BPD patients' propensity for vicious  interpersonal cycles, and their high levels of affect dysregulation and  impulsivity. Finally, the implications of this expanded mentalization-based  approach to BPD for mentalization-based treatment and treatment of BPD more  generally are discussed.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, University of Mississippi  Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216, USA. klgratz@aol.com	Although research has been conducted on the course, consequences, and correlates  of borderline personality disorder (BPD), little is known about its emergence in  childhood, and no studies have examined the extent to which theoretical models  of the pathogenesis of BPD in adults are applicable to the correlates of  borderline personality symptoms in children. The goal of this study was to  examine the interrelationships between two BPD-relevant personality traits  (affective dysfunction and disinhibition), self- and emotion-regulation  deficits, and childhood borderline personality symptoms among 263 children aged  9 to 13. We predicted that affective dysfunction, disinhibition, and their  interaction would be associated with childhood borderline personality symptoms,  and that self- and emotion-regulation deficits would mediate these  relationships. Results provided support for the roles of both affective  dysfunction and disinhibition (in the form of sensation seeking) in childhood  borderline personality symptoms, as well as their hypothesized interaction.  Further, both self- and emotion-regulation deficits partially mediated the  relationship between affective dysfunction and childhood borderline personality  symptoms. Finally, results provided evidence of different gender-based pathways  to childhood borderline personality symptoms, suggesting that models of BPD  among adults are more relevant to understanding the factors associated with  borderline personality symptoms among girls than boys.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Center for Research in Human Development,  Concordia University, 7141 East Sherbrooke Street, Montréal, Québec H4B 1R6,  Canada, USA. william.bukowksi@concordia.ca	A multisample, multistudy project aimed at understanding how individual  differences in narcissism during early adolescence are related to distortions in  the aggression, and the reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to  negative and positive experiences. The findings indicate that individual  differences in narcissism are a remarkably stable aspect of personality during  early adolescence. It is predictably related to an inflated view of the self  that is not warranted by objective indices of social functioning. Further  evidence shows that it promotes the continuity of aggressive behavior and is  more strongly related to reactive aggression than to proactive aggression and  more strongly related to relational aggression than to physical aggression.  Finally, there is evidence that distortions in the self may derive from the  inadequate functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, one of the  body's main response system for dealing with stress. These findings are  discussed in terms of the processes by which early adolescents react to threats  and arousal in their daily functioning.

Rudolph KD(1), Klein DN.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Illinois, 603 East Daniel Street,  Champaign, IL 61820, USA. krudolph@illinois.edu	Research suggests that depressive personality (DP) disorder may represent a  persistent, trait-based form of depression that lies along an affective spectrum  ranging from personality traits to diagnosable clinical disorders. A significant  gap in this area of research concerns the development of DP and its  applicability to youth. The present research explored the construct of DP traits  in youth. Specifically, this study examined the reliability, stability, and  validity of the construct, potential origins of DP traits, and the developmental  consequences of DP traits. A sample of 143 youth (mean age = 12.37 years, SD =  1.26) and their caregivers completed semistructured interviews and  questionnaires on two occasions, separated by a 12-month interval. The measure  of DP traits was reliable and moderately stable over time. Providing evidence of  construct validity, DP traits were associated with a network of constructs,  including a negative self-focus, high-negative and low-positive emotionality,  and heightened stress reactivity. Moreover, several potential origins of DP  traits were identified, including a history of family adversity, maternal DP  traits, and maternal depression. Consistent with hypotheses regarding their  developmental significance, DP traits predicted the generation of stress and the  emergence of depression (but not nondepressive psychopathology) during the  pubertal transition. Finally, depression predicted subsequent DP traits,  suggesting a reciprocal process whereby DP traits heighten risk for depression,  which then exacerbates these traits. These findings support the construct of DP  traits in youth, and suggest that these traits may be a useful addition to  developmental models of risk for youth depression.

Baker LA(1), Tuvblad C, Reynolds C, Zheng M, Lozano DI, Raine A.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA  90089-1061, USA. lbaker@usc.edu	The genetic and environmental basis of a well-replicated association between  antisocial behavior (ASB) and resting heart rate was investigated in a  longitudinal twin study, based on two measurements between the ages of 9 and 14  years. ASB was defined as a broad continuum of externalizing behavior problems,  assessed at each occasion through a composite measure based on parent ratings of  trait aggression, delinquent behaviors, and psychopathic traits in their  children. Parent ratings of ASB significantly decreased across age from  childhood to early adolescence, although latent growth models indicated  significant variation and twin similarity in the growth patterns, which were  explained almost entirely by genetic influences. Resting heart rate at age 9-10  years old was inversely related to levels of ASB but not change patterns of ASB  across age or occasions. Biometrical analyses indicated significant genetic  influences on heart rate during childhood, as well as ASB throughout development  from age 9 to 14. Both level and slope variation were significantly influenced  by genetic factors. Of importance, the low resting heart rate and ASB  association was significantly and entirely explained by their genetic  covariation, although the heritable component of heart rate explained only a  small portion (1-4%) of the substantial genetic variance in ASB. Although the  effect size is small, children with low resting heart rate appear to be  genetically predisposed toward externalizing behavior problems as early as age 9  years old.

Patrick CJ(1), Fowles DC, Krueger RF.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455,  USA. cpatrick@umn.edu	The clinical concept of psychopathy ("psychopathic personality") is generally  considered to entail persistent behavioral deviancy in the company of  emotional-interpersonal detachment. However, longstanding debates continue  regarding the appropriate scope and boundaries of the concept. Here, we review  alternative historic descriptions of the disorder together with empirical  findings for the best-established assessment instruments in use with adolescents  and youth as a basis for formulating an integrative, triarchic model of  psychopathy. The essence of the triarchic model is that psychopathy encompasses  three distinct phenotypic constructs: disinhibition, which reflects a general  propensity toward problems of impulse control; boldness, which is defined as the  nexus of social dominance, emotional resiliency, and venturesomeness; and  meanness, which is defined as aggressive resource seeking without regard for  others ("dysaffliated agency"). These differing phenotypic components are  considered in terms of relevant etiologic and developmental pathways. The  triarchic conceptualization provides a basis for reconciling and accommodating  alternative descriptive accounts of psychopathy, and a framework for  coordinating research on neurobiological and developmental processes  contributing to varying manifestations of the disorder.

Childhood personality pathology: dimensional stability and change.	de Clercq B(1), van Leeuwen K, van den Noortgate W, de Bolle M, de Fruyt F.	Author information: (1)Department of Developmental, Personality and Social Psychology, Ghent  University, Gent, Belgium. BarbaraJ.DeClercq@ugent.be	Studies on the developmental course of personality disorders have suggested that  adult personality disorders enclose both features with a natural plasticity over  time, as well as stable components represented by underlying trait dimensions.  The current study broadens this dimensional stability perspective toward an  earlier developmental stage, and describes with different indices of stability  the longitudinal behavior of basic childhood maladaptive trait dimensions in a  community sample of 477 Flemish children. The results underscore structural,  rank-order, and within-person stability for the disagreeableness, emotional  instability, introversion, and compulsivity dimensions and suggest a similar  maturation principle as has been proposed for adults. Individual growth curve  analyses indicate that children's maladaptive trait scores generally decrease as  they grow older, with a smaller decline for high-scoring individuals. Childhood  maladaptive traits and general psychopathology dimensions show similar  longitudinal patterns in terms of shape and change over time, supporting a  spectrum conceptualization of Axis I related pathology and personality disorder  precursors at young age. The implications of these findings for a developmental  perspective on dimensional conceptualizations of personality disorders are  discussed.

The development of personality disorders: perspectives from normal personality  development in childhood and adolescence.	Shiner RL(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Colgate University, Hamilton, NY 13346, USA.  rshiner@mail.colgate.edu	The developmental pathways leading to personality disorders are poorly  understood, but clues to these pathways come from recent research on personality  disorders and normal personality development in childhood and adolescence. The  first section of this paper reviews recent work on personality disorders in  childhood and adolescence, and concludes that personality disorders in  adolescence are already prevalent, moderately stable, and impairing. The second  section draws on McAdams and Pals' personality model to offer a taxonomy of  personality differences that can account for the known patterns of emerging  personality pathology. This taxonomy includes youths' temperament and  personality traits, mental representations (including attachment), coping  strategies, and narrative identities. Individual differences in all of these  domains may play critical roles in the development, manifestation, and course of  personality disorders. Existing knowledge of normal and abnormal personality  development can inform future research on the developmental pathways leading to  personality pathology, the diagnostic criteria for personality disorders, and  the development of validated treatments for personality disorders in the first  two decades of life.

Forgatch MS(1), Patterson GR, Degarmo DS, Beldavs ZG.	Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center, 10 Shelton McMurphey Boulevard, Eugene, OR  97401, USA. marionf@oslc.org	This paper presents experimental tests of the Oregon delinquency model applied  within a randomized design of an at-risk sample of single mothers and their  elementary school-aged sons. In the theoretical model, ineffective parenting  practices and deviant peer association serve as the primary mechanisms for  growth in adolescent delinquent behavior and early arrests. Multiple-method  assessments of 238 mothers and sons include delinquency as measured by teacher  reports and official arrest records, parenting skills measured by observations  of parent-child interactions, and deviant peer association as reported by focal  boys. Analyses of the 9-year follow-up data indicate that the Oregon model of  parent management training significantly reduced teacher-reported delinquency  and police arrests for focal boys. As hypothesized, the experiments demonstrated  that improving parenting practices and reducing contacts with deviant peers  served as mediating mechanisms for reducing rates of adolescent delinquency. As  predicted, there was also a significant delay in the timing of police arrests  for youth in the experimental as compared to the control group.

Shaw DS(1), Connell A, Dishion TJ, Wilson MN, Gardner F.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, 210 South Bouquet Street,  4101 Sennott Square, Pittsburgh, PA 15260-0001, USA. casey@pitt.edu	Maternal depression has been consistently linked to the development of child  problem behavior, particularly in early childhood, but few studies have examined  whether reductions in maternal depression serve as a mediator in relation to  changes associated with a family-based intervention. The current study addressed  this issue with a sample of 731 families receiving services from a national food  supplement and nutrition program. Families with toddlers between ages 2 and 3  were screened and then randomized to a brief family intervention, the Family  Check-Up, which included linked interventions that were tailored and adapted to  the families needs. Follow-up intervention services were provided at age 3 and  follow-up of child outcomes occurred at ages 3 and 4. Latent growth models  revealed intervention effects for early externalizing and internalizing problems  from 2 to 4, and reductions in maternal depression from ages 2 to 3. In  addition, reductions in maternal depression mediated improvements in both child  externalizing and internalizing problem behavior after accounting for the  potential mediating effects of improvements in positive parenting. The results  are discussed with respect to targeting maternal depression in future  intervention studies aimed at improving early child problem behavior.

Socially indiscriminate attachment behavior in the Strange Situation: convergent  and discriminant validity in relation to caregiving risk, later behavior  problems, and attachment insecurity.	Lyons-Ruth K(1), Bureau JF, Riley CD, Atlas-Corbett AF.	Author information: (1)Harvard Medical School, Cambridge Hospital, 1493 Cambridge Street, Cambridge,  MA 02139, USA. klruth@hms.harvard.edu	Socially indiscriminate attachment behavior has been repeatedly observed among  institutionally reared children. Socially indiscriminate behavior has also been  associated with aggression and hyperactivity. However, available data rely  heavily on caregiver report of indiscriminate behavior. In addition, few studies  have been conducted with samples of home-reared infants exposed to inadequate  care. The current study aimed to develop a reliable laboratory measure of  socially indiscriminate forms of attachment behavior based on direct observation  and to validate the measure against assessments of early care and later behavior  problems among home-reared infants. Strange Situation episodes of 75 socially  at-risk mother-infant dyads were coded for infant indiscriminate attachment  behavior on the newly developed Rating for Infant-Stranger Engagement. After  controlling for infant insecure-organized and disorganized behavior in all  analyses, extent of infant-stranger engagement at 18 months was significantly  related to serious caregiving risk (maltreatment or maternal psychiatric  hospitalization), observed quality of disrupted maternal affective  communication, and aggressive and hyperactive behavior problems at age 5.  Results are discussed in relation to the convergent and discriminant validity of  the new measure and to the potential utility of a standardized observational  measure of indiscriminate attachment behavior. Further validation is needed in  relation to caregiver report measures of indiscriminate behavior.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409000376 PMCID: PMC2666941 PMID: 19338688 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Concurrent changes in conduct problems and depressive symptoms in early  adolescents: a developmental person-centered approach.	Chen R(1), Simons-Morton B.	Author information: (1)Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, 3520 Prospect Street, NW  #314, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057, USA. chenrs@georgetown.edu	The co-occurrence of conduct problems (CP) and depressive symptoms (DS) is an  important topic in developmental psychopathology; however, research in this area  is still in its early stages. Using data from a school-based longitudinal sample  of 2,453 adolescents with five waves from Grade 6 to 9, we examined the  prevalence, etiology, and consequences of the co-occurrence of CP and DS. A  person-centered approach, general growth mixture modeling, was applied to obtain  CP and DS trajectory groups. The risk factors and consequences of the  co-occurrence problem were examined using the trajectory groups. As hypothesized  in a nonclinical sample, a small proportion of boys (8.8%) and girls (3.7%)  reported to be high in both CP and DS over time. Among the adolescents with the  highest level of CP, only 6.3% of the boys and 6.0% of the girls experienced the  highest level of DS. However, among those with the highest level of DS  trajectories, 42.9% of the boys and 10.2% of the girls reported the highest  level of CP, indicating a gender-specific risk of the co-occurrence problem for  depressed boys. Psychosocial and family factors were identified as vulnerable  precursors to co-occurring CP and DS, a finding in line with the multiple domain  risk model for CP and the transactional model for DS. The study also found that  adolescents with the co-occurrence problem were more similar to those with "pure  DS" than those with "pure CP" in academic adjustment at the ninth grade.

Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center, Eugene, OR 97401-4928, USA. jackieb@oslc.org	Postinstitutionalized children frequently demonstrate persistent socioemotional  difficulties. For example, some postinstitutionalized children display an  unusual lack of social reserve with unfamiliar adults. This behavior, which has  been referred to as indiscriminate friendliness, disinhibited attachment  behavior, and disinhibited social behavior, was examined by comparing children  internationally adopted from institutional care to children internationally  adopted from foster care and children raised by their biological families.  Etiological factors and behavioral correlates were also investigated. Both  groups of adopted children displayed more disinhibited social behavior than the  nonadopted children. Of the etiological factors examined, only the length of  time in institutional care was related to disinhibited social behavior.  Disinhibited social behavior was not significantly correlated with general  cognitive ability, attachment-related behaviors, or basic emotion abilities.  However, this behavior was negatively associated with inhibitory control  abilities even after controlling for the length of time in institutional care.  These results suggest that disinhibited social behavior might reflect underlying  deficits in inhibitory control.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409000108 PMCID: PMC2629385 PMID: 19144228 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Comment in     Dev Psychopathol. 2009 Winter;21(1):87-97.	Home baseline and laboratory stressor (Trier Social Stress Test for Children)  measures of salivary cortisol were obtained from 82 participants (40 girls) aged  9, 11, 13, and 15 years. Measures of pubertal development, self-reported stress,  parent reports of child depressive symptoms and fearful temperament, and cardiac  measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity were also obtained.  Significant increases in the home cortisol baselines were found with age and  pubertal development. Cortisol stress reactivity differed by age group with  11-year-olds and 13-year-old boys showing blunted reactivity and 9-year-olds,  13-year-old girls, and 15-year-olds showing significant cortisol reactions.  Cortisol reactivity correlated marginally with sexual maturation. Measures of  sympathetic activity revealed increased sympathetic modulation with age. Higher  sympathetic tone was associated with more fearful temperament, whereas greater  cortisol reactivity was associated with more anxious and depressed symptoms for  girls. The importance of these findings for the hypothesis that  puberty-associated increases in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity  heightens the risk of psychopathology is discussed.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar  Street, New Haven, CT 06510, USA. sally.shaywitz@yale.edu	Extraordinary progress in functional brain imaging, primarily advances in  functional magnetic resonance imaging, now allows scientists to understand the  neural systems serving reading and how these systems differ in dyslexic readers.  Scientists now speak of the neural signature of dyslexia, a singular achievement  that for the first time has made what was previously a hidden disability, now  visible. Paralleling this achievement in understanding the neurobiology of  dyslexia, progress in the identification and treatment of dyslexia now offers  the hope of identifying children at risk for dyslexia at a very young age and  providing evidence-based, effective interventions. Despite these advances, for  many dyslexic readers, becoming a skilled, automatic reader remains elusive, in  great part because though children with dyslexia can be taught to decode words,  teaching children to read fluently and automatically represents the next  frontier in research on dyslexia. We suggest that to break through this  "fluency" barrier, investigators will need to reexamine the more than  20-year-old central dogma in reading research: the generation of the  phonological code from print is modular, that is, automatic and not attention  demanding, and not requiring any other cognitive process. Recent findings now  present a competing view: other cognitive processes are involved in reading,  particularly attentional mechanisms, and that disruption of these attentional  mechanisms play a causal role in reading difficulties. Recognition of the role  of attentional mechanisms in reading now offer potentially new strategies for  interventions in dyslexia. In particular, the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents  affecting attentional mechanisms not only may provide a window into the  neurochemical mechanisms underlying dyslexia but also may offer a potential  adjunct treatment for teaching dyslexic readers to read fluently and  automatically. Preliminary studies suggest that agents traditionally used to  treat disorders of attention, particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder, may prove to be an effective adjunct to improving reading in dyslexic  students.

Author information: (1)National Institutes of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1600, USA.	Human brain development is created through continuing complex interactions of  genetic and environmental influences. The challenge of linking specific genetic  or environmental risk factors to typical or atypical behaviors has led to  interest in using brain structural features as an intermediate phenotype. Twin  studies in adults have found that many aspects of brain anatomy are highly  heritable, demonstrating that genetic factors provide a significant contribution  to variation in brain structures. Less is known about the relative impact of  genes and environment while the brain is actively developing. We summarize  results from the ongoing National Institute of Mental Health child and  adolescent twin study that suggest that heritability of different brain areas  changes over the course of development in a regionally specific fashion. Areas  associated with more complex reasoning abilities become increasingly heritable  with maturation. The potential mechanisms by which gene-environment interactions  may affect heritability values during development is discussed.

Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. ohearnk@upmc.edu	Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social and  communication deficits, and repetitive behavior. Studies investigating the  integrity of brain systems in autism suggest a wide range of gray and white  matter abnormalities that are present early in life and change with development.  These abnormalities predominantly affect association areas and undermine  functional integration. Executive function, which has a protracted development  into adolescence and reflects the integration of complex widely distributed  brain function, is also affected in autism. Evidence from studies probing  response inhibition and working memory indicate impairments in these core  components of executive function, as well as compensatory mechanisms that permit  normative function in autism. Studies also demonstrate age-related improvements  in executive function from childhood to adolescence in autism, indicating the  presence of plasticity and suggesting a prolonged window for effective  treatment. Despite developmental gains, mature executive functioning is limited  in autism, reflecting abnormalities in wide-spread brain networks that may lead  to impaired processing of complex information across all domains.

How can the study of biological processes help design new interventions for  children with severe antisocial behavior?	van Goozen SH(1), Fairchild G.	Author information: (1)School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.  vangoozens@cardiff.ac.uk	Children with severe antisocial behavior have an increased risk of showing  violently aggressive and other forms of problem behavior in adolescence and  adulthood. It is well established that both biological and social factors are  involved in the development of antisocial behavior. The primary aim of this  paper is to discuss the evidence that specific neurobiological systems are  involved in the etiology of childhood-onset antisocial behavior. These factors  are responsible for the severity of the behavioral problems observed in  antisocial children, but they also play a role in their persistence, because  they influence children's interactions with their environment. We will discuss  the possible causes of disruptions in neurobiological systems in childhood  antisocial behavior and point out the implications of these findings for theory  and clinical practice. We will argue that familial factors (e.g., genetic  influences, early childhood adversity) are linked to negative behavioral  outcomes (e.g., antisocial behavior problems) through the mediating and  transactional interplay with neurobiological deficits. An investigation of  neurobiological functioning in antisocial children might not only indicate which  children are most likely to persist in engaging in severe antisocial behavior,  but also guide the development of new interventions.

Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University, USA. cbb11@psu.edu	This paper examines interrelations between biological and social influences on  the development of self-regulation in young children and considers implications  of these interrelations for the promotion of self-regulation and positive  adaptation to school. Emotional development and processes of emotion regulation  are seen as influencing and being influenced by the development of executive  cognitive functions, including working memory, inhibitory control, and mental  flexibility important for the effortful regulation of attention and behavior.  Developing self-regulation is further understood to reflect an emerging balance  between processes of emotional arousal and cognitive regulation. Early childhood  educational programs that effectively link emotional and motivational arousal  with activities designed to exercise and promote executive functions can be  effective in enhancing self-regulation, school readiness, and school success.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Social Behavior, University of  California-Irvine, Irvine, CA92697-7085, USA. codgers@uci.edu	This article reports on the childhood origins and adult outcomes of female  versus male antisocial behavior trajectories in the Dunedin longitudinal study.  Four antisocial behavior trajectory groups were identified among females and  males using general growth mixture modeling and included life-course persistent  (LCP), adolescent-onset, childhood-limited, and low trajectory groups. During  childhood, both LCP females and males were characterized by social, familial and  neurodevelopmental risk factors, whereas those on the adolescent-onset pathway  were not. At age 32, women and men on the LCP pathway were engaging in serious  violence and experiencing significant mental health, physical health, and  economic problems. Females and males on the adolescent-onset pathway were also  experiencing difficulties at age 32, although to a lesser extent. Although more  males than females followed the LCP trajectory, findings support similarities  across gender with respect to developmental trajectories of antisocial behavior  and their associated childhood origins and adult consequences. Implications for  theory, research, and practice are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579408000333 PMID: 18423100 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, 1051 Riverside Drive, New  York, NY 10032, USA. prc2@columbia.edu	Low socioeconomic status (SES) background has been identified as a risk for  several mental disorders. However evidence regarding SES and the developmental  course of personality disorder (PD) has not been addressed. Nor is it clear  whether an SES relationship to PD symptom course may be attributable to known  associated risks. Further, specificity of such relationships to a particular PD  diagnostic pattern independent of comorbidity with other PD or with depression  has not been investigated. Data are from a general population studied  longitudinally between ages 10 and 36 in four assessment waves. Effects of  SES-associated risks on the level of symptoms of schizotypal and borderline  disorders are estimated and compared to effects on depressive symptoms. Low  family SES had robust modest independent effects on both PDs over the entire age  span despite substantial cumulative effects of trauma history, stressful recent  life events, IQ, poor parenting, and comorbid symptoms. SES effects on  depressive symptoms were generally absent, but a small "protective" effect of  low SES appeared when comorbidity with PD symptoms was taken into account.  Cumulatively, these risks account for developmental failures of substantial  magnitude and consequence, marking the importance of understanding the remaining  mechanisms of SES effects and programmatic implications for minimizing  associated risk.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Box 351525, Seattle, WA  98195, USA. liliana@u.washington.edu	Effortful control was examined as a moderator of the relations of three domains  of contextual risk factors to growth in internalizing and externalizing problems  in a community sample (N = 189) of children (8-12 years at Time 1).  Socioeconomic, maternal, and environmental risk factors were examined as  predictors of initial levels and growth in children's adjustment problems across  3 years. The effects of the risk factors depended on children's level of  effortful control. For children lower in effortful control, socioeconomic risk  was related to significantly higher initial levels of internalizing and  externalizing problems and decreases over time. However, children lower in  effortful control had higher levels of problems at all three time points than  children higher in effortful control. Maternal risk was associated with  increases in internalizing for children lower in effortful control, and  environmental risk was related to increases in internalizing and externalizing  problems for children lower in effortful control, but not those higher in  effortful control. Children who were lower in effortful control appeared to  experience more adverse effects of contextual risk than those higher in  effortful control, suggesting that interventions aimed at improving children's  effortful control might serve to protect children from increased risk of  adjustment problems associated with contextual risk factors.

A neurocognitive model of borderline personality disorder: effects of childhood  sexual abuse and relationship to adult social attachment disturbance.	Minzenberg MJ(1), Poole JH, Vinogradov S.	Author information: (1)University of California, Sacramento, CA 95817, USA.  michael.minzenberg@udcmc.ucdavis.edu	Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a paradigmatic disorder of adult  attachment, with high rates of antecedent childhood maltreatment. The  neurocognitive correlates of both attachment disturbance and maltreatment are  both presently unknown in BPD. This study evaluated whether dimensional adult  attachment disturbance in BPD is related to specific neurocognitive deficits,  and whether childhood maltreatment is related to these dysfunctions. An  outpatient BPD group (n=43) performed nearly 1 SD below a control group (n=26)  on short-term recall, executive, and intelligence functions. These deficits were  not affected by emotionally charged stimuli. In the BPD group, impaired recall  was related to attachment-anxiety, whereas executive dysfunction was related to  attachment-avoidance. Abuse history was correlated significantly with executive  dysfunction and at a trend level with impaired recall. Neurocognitive deficits  and abuse history exhibited both independent and interactive effects on adult  attachment disturbance. These results suggest that (a) BPD patients' reactivity  in attachment relationships is related to temporal-limbic dysfunction,  irrespective of the emotional content of stimuli, (b) BPD patients' avoidance  within attachment relationships may be a relational strategy to compensate for  the emotional consequences of frontal-executive dysregulation, and (c) childhood  abuse may contribute to these neurocognitive deficits but may also exert effects  on adult attachment disturbance that is both independent and interacting with  neurocognitive dysfunction.

Bevans K(1), Cerbone A, Overstreet S.	Author information: (1)Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, 19104-4399, USA.  bevans@email.chop.edu	The present study evaluated the independent and cumulative effects of recent  life stress, previous trauma, and recent trauma exposure on salivary cortisol  levels among school-aged children. Sixty-eight children (mean age=10.7 years)  reported their exposure to life stressors and traumatic events in the 12 months  preceding the study. Children and their caregivers reported frequency of  exposure to trauma earlier in life. Exposure to life stress within the past 12  months was related to higher afternoon cortisol levels. Exposure to high levels  of recent trauma in combination with frequent exposure to trauma earlier in life  was related to both lower morning cortisol levels and higher afternoon cortisol  levels. Results suggest that frequency, duration, and severity of exposure to  stress and trauma played key roles in the prediction of basal cortisol levels in  a community sample of urban youth.

Valentino K(1), Cicchetti D, Rogosch FA, Toth SL.	Author information: (1)University of Rochester, USA. kristin.valentino@yale.edu	The current investigation addresses the manner through which trauma affects  basic memory and self-system processes. True and false recall for self-referent  stimuli were assessed in conjunction with dissociative symptomatology among  abused (N=76), neglected (N=92), and nonmaltreated (N=116) school-aged children.  Abused, neglected, and nonmaltreated children did not differ in the level of  processing self-schema effect or in the occurrence and frequency of false  recall. Rather, differences in the affective valence of false recall emerged as  a function of maltreatment subtype and age. Regarding dissociation, the abused  children displayed higher levels of dissociative symptomatology than did the  nonmaltreated children. Although abused, neglected, and nonmaltreated children  did not exhibit differences in the valence of their self-schemas, positive and  negative self-schemas were related to self-integration differently among the  subgroups of maltreatment. Negative self-schemas were associated with increased  dissociation among the abused children, whereas positive self-schemas were  related to increased dissociation for the neglected children. Thus, positive  self-schemas displayed by the younger neglected children were related to higher  dissociation, suggestive of defensive self-processing. Implications for clinical  intervention are underscored.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579408000102 PMID: 18211735 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Hussong AM(1), Flora DB, Curran PJ, Chassin LA, Zucker RA.	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3270, USA.  hussong@unc.edu	Adopting a developmental epidemiology perspective, the current study examines  sources of risk heterogeneity for internalizing symptomatology among children of  alcoholic parents (COAs). Parent-based factors, including comorbid diagnoses and  the number of alcoholic parents in the family, as well as child-based factors,  namely child gender, formed the indicators of heterogeneity. Following a novel  approach to cross-study methods, we present a three-stage analysis involving  measurement development using item response theory, examination of study effects  on latent trajectories over time using latent curve modeling, and prediction of  these latent trajectories testing our theoretically derived hypotheses in two  longitudinal investigations across both mother- and self-reported  symptomatology. Specifically, we replicated previous findings that parent  alcoholism has a unique effect on child internalizing symptoms, above and beyond  those of both parent depression and antisocial personality disorder. However, we  also found important subgroup differences, explaining heterogeneity within COAs'  risk profile in terms of the number of alcoholic parents in the family, comorbid  diagnoses for the alcoholic parent and, for self-reported symptoms, child  gender. Such factors serve to refine the definition of risk among COAs,  suggesting a more severely impaired target group for preventive interventions,  identifying the significance of familial alcoholism in individual differences  underlying internalizing symptoms over time, and further specifying the distal  risk matrix for an internalizing pathway to alcohol involvement.

Trajectories of maternal depression over 7 years: relations with child  psychophysiology and behavior and role of contextual risks.	Ashman SB(1), Dawson G, Panagiotides H.	Author information: (1)University of Washington, USA. sashman@u.washington.edu	This study examines the relation between the longitudinal course of maternal  depression during the child's early life and children's psychophysiology and  behavior at age 6.5 years. One hundred fifty-nine children of depressed and  nondepressed mothers were followed from infancy through age 6.5 years. Growth  mixture modeling was used to identify classes of depressed mothers based on the  longitudinal course of the mother's depression. School-aged children of  chronically depressed mothers were found to have elevated externalizing behavior  problems, decreased social competence, reduced frontal brain activation (EEG  power), and higher respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity. Children of mothers  with decreasing and stable mild depression were found to have increased  hyperactivity and attention problems compared to children of nondepressed  mothers. Contextual risk factors were found to mediate the relation between  maternal depression and child behavioral outcomes.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579408000035 PMID: 18211728 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Predicting aggressive behavior in the third year from infant reactivity and  regulation as moderated by maternal behavior.	Crockenberg SC(1), Leerkes EM, Bárrig Jó PS.	Author information: (1)University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405, USA. susan.crockenberg@uvm.edu	The degree to which infant attention behaviors, together with infant reactivity  to frustrating events, predict aggressive behavior at 2.5 years, and the  moderating effect of maternal behavior were tested with 64 low-risk mothers and  infants. Mothers rated infant negative reactivity at 5 months and aggressive  behavior and maternal trait anger at 2.5 years; infant and maternal behaviors  were observed at 6 months. Based on hierarchical multiple regressions, infant  attention to frustrating events at 6 months positively predicted aggressive  behavior, whereas looking away from frustrating events was associated with less  aggressive behavior for girls only. High reactivity to limits predicted  aggressive behavior only when mothers encouraged infant attention to the  frustrating event, suggesting that maternal behavior amplifies developmental  pathways associated with infant temperament.

Author information: (1)Child Study Center, Yale University, 230 South Frontage Road, New Haven, CT  06519, USA. elena.grigorenko@yale.edu	It is established that reading and reading-related processes are heritable;  genes thus play an important role in the foundation of individual differences in  reading. In this article, we focus on one facet of reading-comprehension.  Comprehension is a higher order cognitive skill that requires many other  cognitive processes for it to unfold completely and successfully. One such  process is executive functioning, which has been associated with genetic  variation in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene. Genotypes and  haplotypes of four single nucleotide polymorphisms in COMT were investigated in  179 incarcerated adolescent delinquents. Four hierarchical logistic regression  models predicting the presence/absence of comprehension difficulties were fitted  to the data; genetic variation in COMT and the presence/absence of maternal  rejection were investigated as main effects and as effects acting interactively.  Three out of four interaction terms were found to be important predictors of  individual differences in comprehension. These findings were supported by the  results of the haplotype analyses, in which the four investigated polymorphisms  were considered simultaneously.

Previous research on these processes has focused largely on  behavioral, cognitive, and psychophysiological properties of the individual and  the dyad. The goals of this study were to explore genetic and environmental  interactions within the family system by examining how the dopamine receptor D2  gene (DRD2) A1+ polymorphism in mothers and children relates to maternal  sensitivity, how maternal and child characteristics might mediate those effects,  and whether maternal sensitivity moderates the association between DRD2 A1+ and  child affective problems. Evidence is found for an evocative effect of child  polymorphism on parenting behavior, and for a moderating effect of child  polymorphism on the association between maternal sensitivity and later child  affective problems. Findings are discussed from a family systems perspective,  highlighting the role of the family as a context for gene expression in both  mothers and children.

A.Taylor@iop.kcl.ac.uk	As studies of measured gene-environment interactions (G x E) in developmental  psychopathology gain momentum, methods for systematically and quantitatively  summarizing effects across multiple studies are urgently needed. Meta-analyses  of G x E findings are critical for evaluating the overall statistical and  theoretical significance of any given G x E based on cumulative and  systematically combined knowledge. Although meta-analytic methods for the  combination of study findings based on single effect measures such as odds  ratios and mean differences are well established, equivalent methods for the  meta-analysis of studies investigating interactions are not well developed. This  article describes one simple approach to the meta-analysis of G x E effects  using, as a contemporaneous example, the interaction of the monoamine oxidase A  (MAOA) gene and the impact of childhood maltreatment on risk for developing  antisocial behavior.

Thapar@cf.ac.uk	The study of gene-environment interaction (G x E) constitutes an area of  significant social and clinical significance. Different types of research study  designs are being used to investigate the contribution of G x E to  psychopathology, although the term G x E has also been used and interpreted in  different ways. Despite mixed evidence that G x E contributes to  psychopathology, some promising and consistent findings are emerging. Evidence  is reviewed in relation to depression, antisocial behavior, schizophrenia, and  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Although findings from various  research designs have different meaning, interestingly much of the evidence with  regard to the contribution of G x E that has arisen from twin and adoption  studies has been for antisocial behavior and depression. It is for these same  forms of psychopathology that molecular genetic evidence of G x E has also been  most convincing. Finally, current and anticipated methodological challenges and  implications for future research in this area are considered.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579407000491 PMID: 17931430 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Do cognitive, physiological, and psychosocial risk and promotive factors predict  desistance from delinquency in males?	Loeber R(1), Pardini DA, Stouthamer-Loeber M, Raine A.	Author information: (1)Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh School of  Medicine, Pittsburgh, 15213, USA. loeberr@upmc.edu	Relatively few studies have examined cognitive, physiological, and psychosocial  promotive and risk factors that can be linked to desistance from delinquency in  community samples. This paper reports on a sample of boys first studied at age 7  and then followed up yearly to age 20. Around age 16, most of the boys received  a range of cognitive tests; at that time, information regarding their resting  heart rate and skin conductance activity in response to aversive stimuli was  also collected. Several psychosocial and two cognitive measures distinguished  delinquents from nondelinquents around age 16. Among the promotive factors  associated with low delinquency were good housing quality, low community crime  (parent and youth report), verbal IQ, delayed verbal memory, and sustained  attention. Predictive analyses discriminating between desisters and persisters  in delinquency between ages 17 and 20 showed that all of the significant  predictors were either child or peer risk factors. None of the cognitive,  physiological, parenting, or community factors significantly predicted  desistance from delinquency. In addition, no promotive factors were  significantly related to desistance. The final set of analyses compared  persisters, desisters, and nondelinquents in terms of their adult adjustment.  Desisters were similar to persisters in that desisters continued to display  serious problems in anxiety, failure to graduate from high school, no post high  school education, being a nonstudent and unemployed, daily cigarette use, and  weekly marijuana use. Desisters scored low on depression and weekly heavy  drinking and in these respects were indistinguishable from nondelinquents and  better off than persisters.

Shannon KE(1), Beauchaine TP, Brenner SL, Neuhaus E, Gatzke-Kopp L.	Author information: (1)Deparment of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-1525,  USA.	In this study, we evaluated predictors of resilience among 8- to 12-year-old  children recruited from primarily low socioeconomic status neighborhoods, 117 of  whom suffered from clinical levels of conduct problems and/or depression, and 63  of whom suffered from no significant symptoms. Tests of interactions were  conducted between (a) paternal antisocial behavior and maternal depression and  (b) several physiological indices of child temperament and emotionality in  predicting (c) children's conduct problems and depression. Both internalizing  and externalizing outcomes among children were associated specifically with  maternal melancholic depression, and not with nonmelancholic depression. In  addition, low levels of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) among children  conferred significant risk for depression, regardless of maternal melancholia,  whereas high RSA offered partial protection. Furthermore, high levels of  maternal melancholia conferred significant risk for child depression, regardless  of paternal antisocial behavior, whereas low levels of maternal melancholia  offered partial protection. Finally, low levels of electrodermal responding  (EDR) conferred significant risk for conduct problems, regardless of paternal  antisocial behavior, whereas high EDR offered partial protection. None of the  identified protective factors offered complete immunity from psychopathology.  These findings underscore the complexity of resilience and resilience-related  processes, and suggest several potential avenues for future longitudinal  research.

Scharf M(1).	Author information: (1)University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel. scharfm@construct.haifa.ac.il	The long-term effects of extreme war-related trauma on the second and the third  generation of Holocaust survivors (HS) were examined in 88 middle-class  families. Differences in functioning between adult offspring of HS (HSO) and a  comparison group, as well as the psychosocial functioning of adolescent  grandchildren of HS, were studied. Degree of presence of Holocaust in the family  was examined in families in which both parents were HSO, either mother or father  was HSO, and neither parent was HSO. Mothers' Holocaust background was  associated with higher levels of psychological distress and less positive  parenting representations. In line with synergic (multiplicative) models of  risk, adolescents in families where both parents were HSO perceived their  mothers as less accepting and less encouraging independence, and reported less  positive self-perceptions than their counterparts. They also perceived their  fathers as less accepting and less encouraging independence, showed higher  levels of ambivalent attachment style, and according to their peers,  demonstrated poorer adjustment during military basic training than their fellow  recruits from the one-parent HSO group. Parents and adolescents in the  one-parent HSO group functioned similarly to others with no Holocaust  background. Parenting variables mediated the association across generations  between degree of Holocaust experience in the family of origin of the parents  and ambivalent attachment style and self-perception of the adolescents. It is  recommended that researchers and clinicians develop awareness of the possible  traces of trauma in the second and the third generation despite their sound  functioning in their daily lives.

The study tested how far group differences in individual  change in adjustment over time were explained by differences in exposure to  specific environmental risk experiences. Data are drawn from the Avon  Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Information on mothers' own  experience of childhood abuse, offspring adjustment at ages 4 and 7 years, and  hypothesized mediators was available for 5,619 families. A residuals scores  analysis was used to track children's adjustment over time. Maternal childhood  abuse was associated with poorer behavioral trajectories between ages 4 and 7  years. Children of abused mothers were more likely to experience a range of  negative life events between ages 4 and 7 years, including changes in family  composition, separations from parents, "shocks and frights" and physical  assaults. Interim life events, together with antecedent psychosocial risk  (maternal antenatal affective symptoms, age 4 parental hostility, age 4 family  type) fully mediated the association between maternal childhood abuse and  offspring prognosis.The authors express their gratitude to the families who  participated in the study. Support for these analyses was provided by a grant  from the Medical Research Council.

Bailey HN(1), Moran G, Pederson DR, Bento S.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, MacKinnon Building, University of Guelph, Guelph,  Ontario, Canada. hnbailey@uoguelph.ca	The interrelations of maternal attachment representations, mother-infant  interaction in the home, and attachment relationships were studied in 99  adolescent mothers and their 12-month-old infants. A q-factor analysis was used  to identify emergent profiles of mother and infant interaction. Traditional  multivariate statistical analyses were complemented by a relationship-based  approach utilizing latent class analysis. The results confirmed many theoretical  predictions linking interaction with autonomous maternal representations and  secure attachment, but failed to support a mediating role for maternal  sensitivity. Strong associations were found between mothers displaying  nonsensitive and disengaged interaction profiles, infants who did not interact  harmoniously with the mother and preferred interaction with the visitor,  unresolved maternal representations, and disorganized attachment relationships.  Moreover, maternal nonsensitive and disengaged interaction in the home mediated  the association between unresolved representations and disorganization. The  results of the latent class analysis were consistent with these findings and  revealed additional, empirically derived associations between attachment  classifications and patterns of interactive behavior, some of which prompt a  reconsideration of our current understanding of attachment transmission in  at-risk populations.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel.  Feldman@mail.biu.ac.il	Individual, dyadic, and triadic influences on the development of the family  system were examined in the context of developmental risk. Participants were 145  couples and their 4-month-old first-born child in six groups: controls, three  mother-risk groups (depressed, anxious, comorbid), and two infant-risk groups  (preterm, intrauterine growth retardation). Dyadic and triadic interactions were  observed. Differences in parent-infant reciprocity and intrusiveness were found,  with mother-risk groups scoring less optimally than controls and infant-risk  groups scoring the poorest. Similar results emerged for family-level cohesion  and rigidity. Structural modeling indicated that father involvement had an  influence on the individual level, by reducing maternal distress, as well as on  the triadic level, by increasing family cohesion. Maternal emotional distress  affected the reciprocity component of early dyadic and triadic relationships,  whereas infant negative emotionality impacted on the intrusive element of  parenting and family-level relationships. Discussion considered the multiple and  pattern-specific influences on the family system as it is shaped by maternal and  child risk conditions.

Variable- and person-based  analyses suggest that, at least through children's early adolescence, maternal  drug use is no more inimical for them than is maternal depression. A second goal  was to illuminate vulnerability and protective processes linked with mothers'  everyday functioning, and results showed that negative parenting behaviors were  linked with multiple adverse child outcomes. Conversely, the other parenting  dimensions showed more domain specificity; parenting stress was linked with  children's lifetime diagnoses, and limit setting and closeness with children's  externalizing problems and everyday competence, respectively. Results are  discussed in terms of implications for resilience theory, interventions, and  social policy.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579407070113 PMCID: PMC1933495 PMID: 17241491 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Crimes Against Children Research Center, University of New Hampshire, 126  Horton Social Science Center, 20 College Road, Durham, NH 03824, USA.  david.finkelhor@unh.edu	This paper utilizes a national longitudinal probability sample of children to  demonstrate how important exposure to multiple forms of victimization  (polyvictimization) is in accounting for increases in children's symptomatic  behavior. The study is based on two annual waves of the Developmental  Victimization Survey that began with a nationally representative sample of  children and youth ages 2 to 17. A broad range of victimization experiences were  assessed using the 34-item Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire. Eighteen  percent of the children experienced four or more different kinds of  victimization (polyvictims) in the most recent year. Polyvictimization in the  most recent year was highly predictive of trauma symptoms at the end of the  year, controlling for prior victimization and prior mental health status. When  polyvictimization was taken into account, it greatly reduced or eliminated the  association between most other individual victimizations and symptomatology  scores.

Lateral glances toward moving stimuli among young children with autism: Early  regulation of locally oriented perception?	Mottron L(1), Mineau S, Martel G, Bernier CS, Berthiaume C, Dawson M, Lemay M,  Palardy S, Charman T, Faubert J.	Author information: (1)University of Montréal. mottronl@istar.ca	Autistic adults display enhanced and locally oriented low-level perception of  static visual information, but diminished perception of some types of movement.  The identification of potential precursors, such as atypical perceptual  processing, among very young children would be an initial step toward  understanding the development of these phenomena. The purpose of this study was  to provide an initial measure and interpretation of atypical visual exploratory  behaviors toward inanimate objects (AVEBIOs) among young children with autism. A  coding system for AVEBIOs was constructed from a corpus of 40 semistandardized  assessments of autistic children. The most frequent atypical visual behavior  among 15 children aged 33-73 months was lateral glance that was mostly oriented  toward moving stimuli and was detected reliably by the experimenters (intraclass  correlation > .90). This behavior was more common among autistic than typically  developing children of similar verbal mental age and chronological age. As  lateral vision is associated with the filtering of high spatial frequency  (detail perception) information and the facilitation of high temporal  frequencies (movement perception), its high prevalence among very young autistic  children may reflect early attempts to regulate and/or optimize both excessive  amounts of local information and diminished perception of movement. These  findings are initial evidence for the need to consider the neural bases and  development of atypical behaviors and their implications for intervention  strategies.

Nuechterlein KH(1), Pashler HE, Subotnik KL.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of  California, Los Angeles 90095-6968, USA. keithn@ucla.edu	Abnormalities in attention have long been viewed as one of the fundamental  underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, likely contributing both to  formation of some types of symptoms and particularly to the substantial work and  social impairments that often accompany schizophrenia. Yet, the precise nature  of the attentional deficits in schizophrenia remains poorly understood.  Translating advances in cognitive psychology to clinical research brings  paradigms with greater analytic power to the study of attention in  schizophrenia. In particular, these paradigms should shed light on whether the  attentional dysfunction in schizophrenia is best conceptualized as arising from  limitations in amount or allocation of processing capacity or from more specific  structural bottlenecks that do not allow certain processes to be carried out in  two tasks simultaneously. Certain types of dual-task paradigms are particularly  well suited to make distinctive predictions, particularly those involving a  psychological refractory period paradigm. The background and design of a series  of ongoing studies of prodromal, first-episode, and chronic schizophrenia  patients are described that are addressing the developmental course of  attentional dysfunction in this disorder. These refined paradigms should  substantially increase our understanding of the specific forms of attentional  impairment characterizing schizophrenia and their connections to symptom  development and functional outcome.

Theory and findings from these domains are  reviewed and synthesized in the proposed model, which posits that (a) aggressive  behavior and hostile attributions are universal human characteristics, (b)  socialization leads to the development of benign attributions, (c) individual  differences in attributional style account for differences in aggressive  behavior, and (d) interventions to change attributions have the potential to  alter antisocial development.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, OH  45267-0559, USA. delbelmp@email.uc.edu	Despite the high prevalence rate, there have been relatively few controlled  studies to systematically examine pharmacological treatments for children and  adolescents with bipolar disorder. We review the differences in clinical  characteristics between youth and adults with bipolar disorder and the extant  literature of pharmacological treatments for children and adolescents with  bipolar disorder, as well as discuss the effectiveness of pharmacological  interventions for treating children and adolescents who are at familial risk for  developing bipolar disorder. Although the number of controlled studies of youth  with manic and mixed episodes is rapidly growing, there are few studies  examining treatments for depression and the prevention of recurrent affective  episodes in this population. Although children and adolescents with bipolar  disorder commonly present with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, such as  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, there are limited data to guide the  treatment of these patients. Recently, studies have begun to characterize  prodromal manifestations of bipolar disorder and identify early intervention  strategies for treating children and adolescents with an elevated risk for  developing bipolar disorder.

Author information: (1)Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical  Center, PA 15123-2593, USA. thaseme@upmc.edu	Bipolar affective disorder is a recurrent, disabling, and potentially lethal  illness that typically begins early in life. Although the disorder is defined by  the manic and hypomanic episodes, for most people the depression episodes are  the more virulent aspect of the illness. Specifically, the depressive episodes  are more numerous, last longer, and are more difficult to treat than the manias,  and depression is the principal cause of the illness's increased mortality due  to suicide. For people with early-onset depression, predictors of subsequent  bipolarity include a family history, psychotic features, and reverse  neurovegetative features. Initial episodes of depression are commonly  misdiagnosed, which often delays initiation of appropriate therapy and increases  the likelihood of treatment with antidepressants alone. Unfortunately, the  correct diagnosis is often not made until there has been a treatment-emergent  affective switch. There are no treatments specifically approved for bipolar  disorder in youth and, among antidepressants, only fluoxetine has received  approved. When bipolarity is suspected, treatment with mood stabilizers, both  conventional (i.e., lithium, valproate, and carbamazapine) and more recently  classified (lamotrigine) and atypical antipsychotics should be prioritized. When  antidepressants are indicated in combination with mood stabilizers, first choice  options include bupropion and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.  Studies of adults indicate that several forms of focused psychotherapy may  improve longer term outcomes.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579406060585 PMID: 17064435 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The role of psychosocial stress in the onset and progression of bipolar disorder  and its comorbidities: the need for earlier and alternative modes of therapeutic  intervention.	Post RM(1), Leverich GS.	Author information: (1)Penn State University School of Medicine, USA. robert.post@speakeasy.net	Psychosocial stress plays an important role at multiple junctures in the onset  and course of bipolar disorder. Childhood adversity may be a risk factor for  vulnerability to early onset illness, and an array of stressors may be relevant  not only to the onset, recurrence, and progression of affective episodes, but  the highly prevalent substance abuse comorbidities as well. A substantial group  of controlled studies indicate that various cognitive behavioral psychotherapies  and psychoeducational approaches may yield better outcomes in bipolar disorder  than treatment as usual. Yet these approaches do not appear to be frequently or  systematically employed in clinical practice, and this may contribute to the  considerable residual morbidity and mortality associated with conventional  treatment. Possible practical approaches to reducing this deficit (in an illness  that is already underdiagnosed and undertreated even with routine medications)  are offered. Without the mobilization of new clinical and public health  approaches to earlier and more effective treatment and supportive interventions,  bipolar illness will continue to have grave implications for many patients'  long-term well being.

Author information: (1)Psychology Department, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-1650,  USA.	The aim of this paper is to highlight the importance of the sleep-wake cycle in  children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. After presenting an overview of  the measurement and function of human sleep, we describe changes in sleep and  circadian functioning across the life cycle. We then review evidence that, in  adults, sleep and/or circadian rhythms are of considerable influence in the  multifactorial causal chain implicated in relapse in bipolar disorder,  discussing relevant mechanisms. The latter include abnormalities in the amount  and timing of sleep, the role of social zeitgebers, and the importance of sleep  in regulating emotional responses and mood. We next present preliminary data  indicating considerable sleep disturbance among children and adolescents with  bipolar disorder. Given the considerable sleep disturbance evident among  children and adolescents with bipolar disorder along with a key role for sleep  in emotion regulation and learning, we conclude that sleep among children and  adolescents with bipolar disorder is a critical domain for future research. An  agenda for future research is presented that includes descriptive studies,  investigations of causality, and treatment development research.

Chang K(1), Adleman N, Wagner C, Barnea-Goraly N, Garrett A.	Author information: (1)Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305-5540, USA.  kchang88@stanford.edu	There is a great need for discovery of biological markers that could be used  diagnostically for pediatric onset disorders, particularly those with  potentially confusing phenomenology such as pediatric-onset bipolar disorder  (BD). Obtaining these markers would help overcome current subjective diagnostic  techniques of relying on parent and child interview and symptomatic history.  Brain imaging may be the most logical choice for a diagnostic tool, and certain  neurobiological abnormalities have already been found in pediatric BD. However,  much work remains to be done before neuroimaging can be used reliably to  diagnose this disorder, and because of the nature of BD and the limitations of  imaging technology and technique, neuroimaging will likely at most be only a  diagnostic aide in the near future. In this paper we discuss the characteristics  of pediatric BD that complicate the use of biological markers as diagnostic  tools, how neuroimaging techniques have been used to study pediatric BD so far,  and the limitations and potential of such techniques for future diagnostic use.

A cognitive vulnerability-stress perspective on bipolar spectrum disorders in a  normative adolescent brain, cognitive, and emotional development context.	Alloy LB(1), Abramson LY, Walshaw PD, Keyser J, Gerstein RK.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Temple University, Philadelphia 19122, USA.  lalloy@temple.edu	Why is adolescence an "age of risk" for onset of bipolar spectrum disorders? We  discuss three clinical phenomena of bipolar disorder associated with adolescence  (adolescent age of onset, gender differences, and specific symptom presentation)  that provide the point of departure for this article. We present the cognitive  vulnerability-transactional stress model of unipolar depression, evidence for  this model, and its extension to bipolar spectrum disorders. Next, we review  evidence that life events, cognitive vulnerability, the cognitive  vulnerability-stress combination, and certain developmental experiences (poor  parenting and maltreatment) featured in the cognitive vulnerability-stress model  play a role in the onset and course of bipolar disorders. We then discuss how an  application of the cognitive vulnerability-stress model can explain the  adolescent age of onset, gender differences, and adolescent phenomenology of  bipolar disorder. Finally, we further elaborate the cognitive  vulnerability-stress model by embedding it in the contexts of normative  adolescent cognitive (executive functioning) and brain development, normative  adolescent development of the stress-emotion system, and genetic vulnerability.  We suggest that increased brain maturation and accompanying increases in  executive functioning along with augmented neural and behavioral  stress-sensitivity during adolescence combine with the cognitive  vulnerability-stress model to explain the high-risk period for onset of bipolar  disorder, gender differences, and unique features of symptom presentation during  adolescence.

Phenomenology and diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children, adolescents, and  adults: complexities and developmental issues.	Carlson GA(1), Meyer SE.	Author information: (1)State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY 11794-8790, USA.  gabrielle.carlson@stonybrook.edu	This review addresses the phenomenology of mania/bipolar disorder from a  developmental psychopathology perspective and uses cases with longitudinal  information to illustrate major points. Beginning with a summary of the  phenomenology of bipolar illness as it occurs in adults, the authors identify  diagnostic complexities unique to children and adolescents. These include the  challenges of characterizing elation and grandiosity; differentiating mania from  comorbid symptoms, rages, sequelae of maltreatment, and typical developmental  phenomena; and the unique manifestations of psychosis. We conclude with the  observation that a significant difference between early and later onset bipolar  disorder is that, in the former, there appears to be a global delay or arrest in  the development of appropriate affect regulation; whereas in adult-onset bipolar  illness, emotion dysregulation generally presents as an intermittent phenomenon.  At this juncture, the study of childhood bipolar illness would benefit from a  developmental psychopathology perspective to move beyond the level of  cross-sectional symptom description to begin to study individuals over time,  focusing on developmental, environmental, genetic, and neurobiological  influences on manifest behavior.

Schulz MS(1), Waldinger RJ, Hauser ST, Allen JP.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Bryn Mawr College, 101 North Merion Avenue, Bryn  Mawr, PA 19010, USA.	Within-family covariation between interparental hostility and adolescent  behavior across three interactions over a 2-year period was explored in a sample  that included 37 typical adolescents and 35 adolescents recently hospitalized  for psychiatric difficulties. More interparental hostility across the three  interactions was associated with more adolescent hostility and more positive  engagement (at a trend level) regardless of psychiatric background.  Parent-to-child hostility in each interaction mediated the link for adolescent  hostility but not for positive adolescent engagement. Emotion regulation  capacities and age were linked to variability in adolescents' behavior in the  presence of interparental conflict. In interactions with more interparental  hostility, adolescents with greater capacity to tolerate negative affect were  more likely to show increased positive engagement, and adolescents who were  better able to modulate their emotional expression were less likely to show  increased hostility. Covariation between interparental and adolescent hostility  across the three family interactions decreased as the adolescent aged. These  findings are consistent with the theory that exposure to interparental hostility  is emotionally disequilibrating, and that adolescent responses may reflect  differences in emotion regulation and other developmentally based capacities.  Gender and variations across families in overall levels of hostile parenting  were also linked with adolescent behavior in the presence of interparental  hostility.

In  addition, we asked if emotion-specific socialization strategies tell us more  about child psychopathology than global socialization strategies do. Exploratory  analyses suggest that a mixture of both emotion-specific and global  socialization strategies may best predict child psychopathology. It remains  important to clarify the emotional context of socialization strategies.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579405050224 PMID: 16761554 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Dunantlaan 2,  B-9000 Ghent, Belgium. sylvie.verte@UGent.be	The main aims of this study were to investigate if children with  high-functioning autism (HFA) and children with Tourette syndrome (TS) can be  differentiated in their executive functioning (EF) profile compared to normal  controls (NCs) and compared to each other and to investigate whether children  with HFA or children with TS and a comorbid group of children with both  disorders are distinct conditions in terms of EF, Four groups of children  participated in this study: HFA, TS, comorbid HFA + TS, and a NC group. All  children were in the age range of 6 to 13 years. The groups were compared on  five major domains of EF: inhibition, visual working memory, planning, cognitive  flexibility, and verbal fluency. Children with HFA scored lower than NC children  on all the EFs measured. Children with TS and NC children showed the same EF  profile. The HFA group scored lower than the TS group for inhibition of a  prepotent response and cognitive flexibility. Children with HFA performed poorer  than children with comorbid HFA + TS on all functions, with the exception of  inhibiting an ongoing response, interference control, and verbal fluency.  Children with TS and children with comorbid HFA + TS could not be differentiated  from one another in terms of EF. This study indicates that EF deficits are  highly characteristic of children with HFA in comparison to children with TS and  NC. The results suggest that for the comparison between HFA and TS groups, it is  important to take into account comorbidity. A reevaluation of the EF hypothesis  in children with TS is suggested.

Author information: (1)Division of Family Studies and Human Development, University of Arizona, PO  Box 210033, Tucson, AZ 85721-033, USA. bjellis@email.arizona.edu	In two studies comprising 249 children and their families, the authors utilized  secondary, exploratory data analyses to examine Boyce and Ellis' (this issue)  evolutionary-developmental theory of biological sensitivity to context. The  theory proposes that individual differences in stress reactivity constitute  variation in susceptibility to environmental influence, both positive and  negative, and that early childhood exposures to either highly protective or  acutely stressful environments result in heightened reactivity. In Study 1, 127  3- to 5-year old children were concurrently assessed on levels of  support/adversity in home and preschool environments and on cardiovascular  reactivity to laboratory challenges. In Study 2, 122 children were prospectively  assessed on familial stress in both infancy and preschool and on autonomic and  adrenocortical reactivity to laboratory challenges at age 7. In both studies, a  disproportionate number of children in supportive, low stress environments  displayed high autonomic reactivity. Conversely, in Study 2, a relatively high  proportion of children in very stressful environments showed evidence of  heightened sympathetic and adrenocortical reactivity. Consistent with the  evolutionary-developmental theory, the exploratory analyses also generated the  testable hypothesis that relations between levels of childhood support/adversity  and the magnitude of stress reactivity are curvilinear, with children from  moderately stressful environments displaying the lowest reactivity levels in  both studies.

Author information: (1)University of Chicago, Clinical Neuroscience and Psychopharmacology Research  Unit, Department of Psychiatry, IL 60637, USA. jgollan@uchicago.edu	The aim of this paper is to clarify how neural mechanisms at the molecular  level, specifically the serotonergic (5-HT) system and the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis system (HPA) in conjunction with early life  stress may contribute to the emergence of aggression, self-directed and  otherwise, in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Chronic dysregulation of  these biological systems, which function to regulate stress and emotion, may  potentiate the development of impulsive aggression in borderline personality  conditions. Our central premise in this paper is that brain development, stress  regulation, and early pathonomic experience are interactive and cumulative in  their mutual influence on the development of impulsive aggression in BPD. We  review the parameters of impulsive aggression in BPD, followed by a discussion  of the neurobiological and neuroendocrine correlates of impulsive aggression  with and without BPD. We then focus on the developmental continuities in BPD  with attention to brain maturation of 5-HT and HPA axis function during the life  span and the influence of early adverse experiences on these systems. Finally,  we comment on the data of the relative stability of aggression in BPD,  adolescence as a developmental stage of potential vulnerability, and the course  of aggressive behavior during the life span.

Author information: (1)University of Reading, School of Psychology, Whitenights, Reading, UK.  lynne.murray@reading.ac.uk	We examined the impact on adolescent socioemotional functioning of maternal  postnatal depression (PND) and attachment style. We also investigated the role  of earlier aspects of the child's development-attachment in infancy, and 5-year  representations of family relationships. Ninety-one mother-child pairs,  recruited in the postnatal period, were followed up at 13 years. Adolescents  were interviewed about their friendships, and their level of emotional  sensitivity and maturity were rated. Emotional sensitivity was heightened in  girls whose mothers experienced PND; notably, its occurrence was also linked to  insecure attachment in infancy and raised awareness of emotional components of  family relationships at 5 years. High emotional sensitivity was also associated  with adolescent depressed mood. Raised social maturity was predicted by a secure  maternal attachment style and, for girls, by exposure to maternal PND.  Precursors of adolescent social maturity were evident in the narrative coherence  of 5-year family representations. Higher social maturity in the friendship  interview was also associated with overall good adjustment.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579406060263 PMID: 16600065 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Colder CR(1), Chassin L.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Loyola University of Chicago, IL 60626, USA.  CColder@LUC.EDU	Most previous research has assumed that adolescent alcohol use and problem use  represent a continuum and are influenced by the same psychosocial factors, with  problem use representing more severe psychosocial impairment. The current study  evaluated this assumption by identifying the correlates of adolescent alcohol  use and those of problem use. Using a community sample of adolescent children of  alcoholics (COAs) and a demographically matched comparison group (non-COAs), a  typology of adolescent alcohol use was created, and alcohol use groups were  compared on variables chosen from nine psychosocial domains. The correlates of  problem alcohol use were different from those of moderate use. Problem use was  associated with fundamental family disruptions and poor psychological  functioning. In contrast, the determinants of moderate alcohol use reflected  unconventionality and socialization specific to alcohol. Few psychosocial  variables distinguished abstainers from light drinkers. Intervention and  methodological implications of these findings are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579499002084 PMID: 16506537 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Clinic-referred preschool  boys (n = 80) with early onset conduct problems (as indicated by diagnoses of  Oppositional Defiant Disorder) were compared with a case-matched group of 80  nonproblem boys to determine whether observed attachment behaviors could: (a)  differentiate the groups, (b) explain concurrent variation in problem severity  within the clinic group, and (c) predict the outcomes of clinic boys 1 and 2  years later. Over half of the clinic boys with early onset conduct problems  (54%) exhibited an insecure attachment strategy during reunion, as opposed to  18% of comparison group boys. All insecure patterns were overrepresented in the  clinic group. Clinic boys were more likely than comparison boys to engage in  provocative behavior when separated from their mothers. Contrary to our  hypothesis, attachment variables showed little ability to explain concurrent or  future variation in the problem severity or diagnostic status of clinic boys. We  conclude that observable attachment behaviors exhibited during the preschool  years are related to the initial identification of early onset conduct problems  but may have little value by themselves in predicting the subsequent course and  severity of problems in the 2 years following clinic referral.

Trajectories of depressive symptoms and stressful life events among male and  female adolescents in divorced and nondivorced families.	Ge X(1), Natsuaki MN, Conger RD.	Author information: (1)Department of Human and Community Development, University of California, One  Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, USA. xjge@ucdavis.edu	This 11-year longitudinal study models the trajectories of depressive symptoms  among approximately 550 females and males raised in divorced and nondivorced  families in the rural Midwest. Using multilevel analyses, we demonstrate that,  first, depressive symptoms changed according to a curvilinear pattern,  especially for females; they increased during early to midadolescence and then  declined in late adolescence to young adulthood. Second, compared with males,  females experienced a greater number of depressive symptoms in adolescence and  early adulthood. Third, children who experienced parental divorce by age 15  manifested a sharper increase in depressive symptoms compared to those from  nondivorced families. Fourth, stressful life events children experienced shortly  after parental divorce mediated the effect of parental divorce on depressive  symptoms. Fifth and finally, time-varying stressful life events, particularly  those related to relationship and personal loss, were significantly associated  with the trajectories of depressive symptoms.

The contribution of peers to monthly variation in adolescent depressed mood: a  short-term longitudinal study with time-varying predictors.	Connell AM(1), Dishion TJ.	Author information: (1)Child and Family Center, University of Oregon, Eugene 97401-3408, USA.  aconnell@uoregon.edu	This study examined peer predictors of variation and growth in depressed mood  among high-risk adolescents, using child and parent reports of monthly symptoms.  One hundred seventy-six parents and their 10- to 14-year-old children separately  took part in a series of up to nine monthly interviews. Multilevel growth models  examined both time-varying peer predictors of parent and child reports of the  child's depressive symptoms, controlling for age, gender, and treatment status.  Deviant peer affiliation significantly predicted elevated depressive symptoms in  the monthly child-report of depressed mood, especially for younger adolescents.  Children's level of delinquency was significantly related to parent-reported  depressive symptoms, and to child-reported symptoms in older adolescents only.  As expected, depressed mood was higher for girls and more prevalent among older  adolescents. The results suggest that peer processes may be linked in time to  the development of depression, especially among high-risk adolescents.

Crockenberg SC(1), Leerkes EM.	Author information: (1)Psychology Department, Dewey Hall, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT  05405, USA. susan.crockenberg@uvm.edu	The degree to which infant regulatory behaviors, together with infant reactivity  to novelty, predicted anxious behavior at 2.5 years, and the moderating effect  of maternal behavior were tested. Sixty-four low-risk mothers and infants  participated. Mothers rated infant negative reactivity and anxious behavior;  infant and maternal behaviors were observed at 6 months postpartum. Based on  results of hierarchical, multiple regressions, infant regulatory behaviors  (i.e., attention control, withdrawal) moderated associations between reactivity  to novelty and later anxious behavior, but predictions depended also on maternal  behavior. High reactivity to novelty, in conjunction with withdrawal and with  poor attention control, predicted anxious behavior only when mothers were less  engaged or less sensitive, suggesting that maternal behavior alters  developmental trajectories associated with infant temperament.

Kosslyn SM(1).	Author information: (1)Harvard University, USA. smkosslyn@wjh.harvard.edu	Reflective thinking occurs when information stored in long-term memory (LTM) is  not sufficient to allow one to respond "automatically" to an object or event.  Instead, stored information must be entered into working memory and a novel  response or solution produced. In this article I argue that mental imagery plays  a central role in this process, and that over the course of normal cognitive  development the process of reflective thinking "programs" LTM so that an  increasingly large number of tasks can be performed without reflective thinking.  Normal cognitive development thus results in a decreasing reliance on imagery.  However, if highly emotional images are formed, additional retrieval cues can be  entered into LTM, making such images more likely to occur in the future. Such  images induce arousal, similar to that induced by the actual event. This line of  thinking leads to a novel perspective on the neurocognitive deficits that  underlie the development of posttraumatic stress disorder, and may also help to  explain some symptoms seen in hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and difficulties in  self-control.

An integrative theory of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder based on the  cognitive and affective neurosciences.	Nigg JT(1), Casey BJ.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824-1116,  USA. nigg@msu.edu	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioral syndrome that  arises in early childhood, often co-occurs with conduct disorder and leads,  developmentally, to antisocial behavior and substance abuse. Models from  cognitive and affective neuroscience have been invoked in an effort to  understand the development of ADHD, leading to a broad array of interrelated  theories and hypothesized mechanisms. In this paper, we highlight core  mechanisms that may cut across several theories and constructs, and thus provide  some leverage for further study and conceptualization from a neuroscience  perspective. We emphasize the joint operations of frontostriatal and  frontocerebellar neural loops in detecting and predicting what and when  important events in the environment will occur and their interaction with  frontoamygdala loops in assigning emotional significance to these events. We  note that weaknesses in the development of these basic operations could lead to  decrement in the development of cognitive and affective control and other mental  operations mediated by prefrontal cortex during development. In turn, such  decrement could lead to many of the phenotypic cognitive and neuropsychological  features seen in children with ADHD.

A multilevel analysis of cognitive dysfunction and psychopathology associated  with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in children.	Simon TJ(1), Bish JP, Bearden CE, Ding L, Ferrante S, Nguyen V, Gee JC,  McDonald-McGinn DM, Zackai EH, Emanuel BS.	Author information: (1)University of California, Davis, Sacramento 95817, USA. tjsimon@ucdavis.edu.	We present a multilevel approach to developing potential explanations of  cognitive impairments and psychopathologies common to individuals with  chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Results presented support our hypothesis  of posterior parietal dysfunction as a central determinant of characteristic  visuospatial and numerical cognitive impairments. Converging data suggest that  brain development anomalies, primarily tissue reductions in the posterior brain  and changes to the corpus callosum, may affect parietal connectivity. Further  findings indicate that dysfunction in "frontal" attention systems may explain  some executive cognition impairments observed in affected children, and that  there may be links between these domains of cognitive function and some of the  serious psychiatric conditions, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder, autism, and schizophrenia, that have elevated incidence rates in the  syndrome. Linking the neural structure and the cognitive processing levels in  this way enabled us to develop an elaborate structure/function mapping  hypothesis for the impairments that are observed. We show also, that in the case  of the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene, a fairly direct relationship between  gene expression, cognitive function, and psychopathology exists in the affected  population. Beyond that, we introduce the idea that variation in other genes may  further explain the phenotypic variation in cognitive function and possibly the  anomalies in brain development.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to brief images of caregivers' and  strangers' faces for 72 institutionalized children (IG), ages 7-32 months, and  compared with ERPs from 33 children, ages 8-32 months, who had never been  institutionalized. All children resided in Bucharest, Romania. Prominent  differences in four ERP components were observed: early negative (N170), early  positive (P250), midlatency negative (Nc), and positive slow wave (PSW). For all  but the P250, the amplitude of these components was larger in the never  institutionalized group than the institutionalized group; this pattern was  reversed for the P250. Typical effects of the Nc (amplitude greater to stranger  vs. caregiver) were observed in both groups; in contrast, the IG group showed an  atypical pattern in the PSW. These findings are discussed in the context of the  role of experience in influencing the neural circuitry putatively involved in  recognizing familiar and novel faces.

Autism at the beginning: microstructural and growth abnormalities underlying the  cognitive and behavioral phenotype of autism.	Courchesne E(1), Redcay E, Morgan JT, Kennedy DP.	Author information: (1)University of California, San Diego, USA. ecourchesne@ucsd.edu	Autistic symptoms begin in the first years of life, and recent magnetic  resonance imaging studies have discovered brain growth abnormalities that  precede and overlap with the onset of these symptoms. Recent postmortem studies  of the autistic brain provide evidence of cellular abnormalities and processes  that may underlie the recently discovered early brain overgrowth and arrest of  growth that marks the first years of life in autism. Alternative origins and  time tables for these cellular defects and processes are discussed. These  cellular and growth abnormalities are most pronounced in frontal, cerebellar,  and temporal structures that normally mediate the development of those same  higher order social, emotional, speech, language, speech, attention, and  cognitive functions that characterize autism. Cellular and growth pathologies  are milder and perhaps nonexistent in other structures (e.g., occipital cortex),  which are known to mediate functions that are often either mildly affected or  entirely unaffected in autistic patients. It is argued that in autism, higher  order functions largely fail to develop normally in the first place because  frontal, cerebellar, and temporal cellular and growth pathologies occur prior to  and during the critical period when these higher order neural systems first  begin to form their circuitry. It is hypothesized that microstructural  maldevelopment results in local and short distance overconnectivity in frontal  cortex that is largely ineffective and in a failure of long-distance  cortical-cortical coupling, and thus a reduction in frontal-posterior reciprocal  connectivity. This altered circuitry impairs the essential role of frontal  cortex in integrating information from diverse functional systems (emotional,  sensory, autonomic, memory, etc.) and providing context-based and goal-directed  feedback to lower level systems.

Author information: (1)Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology, Teachers College, Columbia  University, Box 133, 525 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027-6696, USA.  suniya.luthar@columbia.edu	This study was focused on contextual variations in the parenting dimensions  salient for preadolescent adjustment. The sample consisted of 614 sixth graders  from two communities, one low and the other high income. Parenting dimensions  included those known to be significant in each socioeconomic context: isolation  from parents (emotional and physical), and parents' emphasis on achievements  (overall expectations and emphasis on integrity over success). Adjustment  outcomes included subjective well-being as well as school competence.  Contradicting stereotypes, results showed that on average, very affluent  children can perceive their parents as emotionally and physically unavailable to  the same degree that youth in serious poverty do. The ramifications for  adjustment also seem to be largely similar: Closeness to parents was beneficial  for all, just as criticism was deleterious. Even after considering the quality  of parent-child relationships, parents' physical absence (e.g., at dinner)  connoted vulnerability for distress and for poor school performance in both  groups. The connotations of a few parenting dimensions varied by context and  gender; these variations are discussed as are overall implications for future  research and practice.

Shirtcliff EA(1), Granger DA, Booth A, Johnson D.	Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin, USA.	Research linking basal cortisol levels with internalizing and externalizing  behavior problems in youths has yielded inconsistent results. We hypothesize  that the high moment to moment variation in adrenocortical activity requires an  analytical strategy that separates variance in cortisol levels attributable to  "stable traitlike" versus "state or situationally specific" sources. Early  morning saliva samples were obtained from 724 youths (M age = 13.5 years; range  = 6-16 years in Year 1) on 2 successive days 1 year apart. Latent state-trait  modeling revealed that 70% of the variance in cortisol levels could be  attributed to statelike sources, and 28% to traitlike sources. For boys only,  higher levels of externalizing problem behaviors were consistently associated  with lower cortisol attributable to traitlike sources across 3 years of  behavioral assessment. The inverse association between individual differences in  cortisol and externalizing problem behavior has previously only been reported in  studies of at-risk or clinical groups. The present findings suggest the  relationship is a stable phenomenon that spans both normative and atypical child  development. Studies are needed to reveal the biosocial mechanisms involved in  the establishment and maintenance of this phenomenon, and to decipher whether  individual differences in this hormone-behavior link confers risk or resilience.

Expanding the concept of unresolved mental states: hostile/helpless states of  mind on the Adult Attachment Interview are associated with disrupted  mother-infant communication and infant disorganization.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School at Cambridge Hospital, 1493  Cambridge Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. klruth@hms.harvard.edu	In a recent meta-analysis, only 53% of disorganized infants were predicted by  parental Unresolved states of mind on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). The  goal of this study was to identify additional predictors of infant  disorganization on the AAI by developing and validating an interview-wide coding  system for Hostile/Helpless (H/H) parental states of mind with respect to  attachment. Maternal AAls were collected from 45 low-income mothers with high  rates of childhood trauma when their children were age 7; Strange Situation  assessments had been collected at 18 months of age. AAIs were independently  coded using both the Main and Goldwyn coding system and newly developed codes  for H/H states of mind. Results indicated that the H/H coding system displayed  discriminant validity in that it did not overlap substantially with the  Unresolved, Cannot Classify, or Fearfully Preoccupied by Traumatic Events  categories in the Main and Goldwyn coding system. Second, H/H states of mind  accounted for variance in disorganized infant behavior not associated with the  Unresolved classification. Third, H/H states of mind were significantly related  to maternal disrupted affective communication as coded by the Atypical Maternal  Behavior Instrument for Assessment and Classification coding system, and  maternal disrupted communication mediated the relations between H/H states of  mind and infant disorganization.

Hussong AM(1), Curran PJ, Moffitt TE, Caspi A, Carrig MM.	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 27599-3270, USA.	We examined two hypotheses about the developmental relation between substance  abuse and individual differences in desistance from antisocial behavior during  young adulthood. The "snares" hypothesis posits that substance abuse should  result in time-specific elevations in antisocial behavior relative to an  individual's own developmental trajectory of antisocial behavior, whereas the  "launch" hypothesis posits that substance abuse early in young adulthood slows  an individual's overall pattern of crime desistance relative to the population  norm during this developmental period. We conducted latent trajectory analyses  to test these hypotheses using interview data about antisocial behaviors and  substance abuse assessed at ages 18, 21, and 26 in men from the Dunedin  Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (N = 461). We found significant  individual variability in initial levels and rates of change in antisocial  behavior over time as well as support for both the snares hypothesis and the  launch hypothesis as explanations for the developmental relation between  substance abuse and crime desistance in young men.

Author information: (1)University of Alabama at Birmingham, Center for the Advancement of Youth  Health, Birmingham, AL 35294-1200, USA. windle@uab.edu	Semiparametric group-based mixture modeling was used with data from an  adolescent school sample (N = 1205) for three purposes. First, five trajectory  groups were identified to characterize different patterns of change in the  frequency of marijuana use across four waves of assessment during adolescence.  These trajectory groups were labeled Abstainers, Experimental Users, Decreasers,  Increasers, and High Chronics. Second, trajectory group comparisons were made  across eight adolescent risk factors to determine distinctive predictors of the  trajectory groups. Findings indicated, for example, that the High Chronic group,  relative to the other trajectory groups, had higher levels of delinquency, lower  academic performance, more drug using friends, and more stressful life events.  Third, adolescent trajectory group comparisons were made across 10 risk  behaviors in young adulthood (average subject age = 23.5 years) and the  occurrence of psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. Findings indicated some  consistency across adolescence to young adulthood with regard to risk factors,  and specificity with regard to the prediction of disorders. Adolescent  trajectory group membership was significantly associated in young adulthood with  cannabis and alcohol disorders but not with major depressive disorders or  anxiety disorders.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel  Hill, NC 27599-3270, USA. ahussong@email.unc.edu	The transition to young adulthood is both a time when risky health behaviors  such as substance misuse peak and a time of opportunity for growth and  development through the acquisition of adult roles. In this transition, coping  styles include responses to the stressors and opportunities associated with the  emergence of adulthood. The extent to which such coping styles are skillfully  employed in part determines adjustment into adulthood. The current study used a  high-risk, longitudinal design to examine the development of coping styles over  adolescence, continuity in these coping styles from adolescence to adulthood,  the impact of coping on adult stress and substance misuse, the ability of coping  to buffer effects of stress on substance use, and differences in coping between  at-risk youth (i.e., children of alcoholics [COAs]) and their peers. A sample of  340 adolescents completed four assessments over ages 11-23. We used latent  trajectory models to examine interindividual and intraindividual change in  coping over time. Evidence for both change and continuity in the development of  coping from adolescence to adulthood was found, although adolescent coping had  limited impact on stress and substance use in adulthood. Support was also found  for complex stress-buffering and stress-exacerbating effects of coping on the  relations between major life events and adult drug use and between stress  associated with the new roles of adulthood and heavy alcohol use. Implications  of these findings for development and adjustment in the transition to adulthood  are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579404040106 PMCID: PMC3159037 PMID: 15704824 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Susan_Dickstein@brown.edu	We explored attachment in a family context by applying family systems principles  to the investigation of multiple attachment relationships within families. This  study focused on maternal adult attachment with respect to family of origin  experiences (assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview [AAI]) as well as  maternal marital attachment (assessed using the Marital Attachment Interview  [MAI]). We examined associations between maternal adult attachment (or marital  attachment) and three levels of family functioning including individual maternal  depression symptoms, dyadic marital satisfaction (reported by mothers), and  family unit functioning. We also examined associations between combined  attachment security (consistent secure, AAI secure/MAI insecure, AAI  insecure/MAI secure, and consistent insecure) and family outcomes. Finally, we  assessed the extent to which attachment representations operate differently in  the context of family stress, namely maternal depression. We found that  attachment security with respect to particular relationships was differentially  associated with different levels of family functioning. Examination of the  security of combined adult and marital attachment further supported the  multilevel organization of the family system.

Author information: (1)Human Development and Family Studies, 203 Spidle Hall, Auburn University,  Auburn, AL 36849, USA. elshemm@auburn.edu	Parent-child conflict and perceived attachments to parents were examined as  predictors, mediators, and moderators in the marital conflict-child adjustment  connection in a sample of older children and young adolescents. After  controlling for marital conflict, parent-child conflict predicted additional  unique variance mainly for children's externalizing problems, and attachments to  parents accounted for unique variance in children's externalizing and  internalizing problems. Moderation effects illustrated that a higher level of  parent-child conflict was a vulnerability factor, whereas a secure attachment  was a protective factor, for behavior problems associated with marital conflict.  Mediation effects were also evident and supported the proposition that  parent-child conflict and attachment to parents mostly are partial mediators of  effects in the marital conflict-child outcomes link. The findings illustrate the  aggregation, potentiation, and amelioration of risk for adjustment problems  associated with marital conflict, and highlight the importance of assessing  multiple systems within the family.

Author information: (1)Department of Human Development and Family Studies, University of  Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA. ibrether@wisc.edu	Marvin and Stewart and Byng-Hall proposed that effective family collaboration  requires family members to construct "shared family working models," and that  the renegotiation of these working models during family transitions is  facilitated by family members' "interactional awareness" (ability to be  perceptive observers of family relationships). We apply these constructs to data  collected from 71 mothers and their 4.5- to 5.0-year-old preschool children, 2  years after parental divorce. Maternal representations of the father as coparent  and ex-spouse, and of father- and mother-child relationships were assessed via  two interviews. A family story completion task captured child representations of  mother-child and father-child, coparental and ex-spousal interactions. Maternal  accounts of mother-child conversations illustrated the negotiation of shared  working models. Primarily qualitative analyses contrasting maternal and child  perspectives are presented in the first section. Then we use regression analyses  to predict children's story themes from maternal representations of flexible,  sensitive, and effective discipline-related interactions; maternal depressive  symptoms; and perception of the child's father. Finally, we identify gender  differences in children's enactments of divorce-related and child-empathy  themes. We conclude by considering how our findings could be used to assist  post-divorce families in constructing shared rather than conflicting working  models of family relations.

The aim of the present study was to  investigate whether children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD) differ from ODD children with (OD/AD) or without comorbid ADHD in ANS and  HPA axis activity under baseline and stressful conditions. The effects of stress  on cortisol, heart rate (HR), and skin conductance level (SCL) were studied in  95 children (26 normal control [NC] children and 69 child psychiatric patients  referred for externalizing behavior problems [15 ODD, 31 OD/AD, and 23 ADHD]).  No baseline differences were found in cortisol between the four groups. However,  the ODD and OD/AD groups showed a significantly weaker cortisol response to  stress compared to the ADHD and NC groups; the ADHD group had a similar cortisol  response as the NC group. Within the ODD group this pattern of low cortisol  responsivity was most clearly present in the more severely affected inpatients.  With respect to HR, the ODD group had a significantly lower HR during baseline  and stressful conditions. The higher HR levels in the OD/AD and ADHD groups were  likely to be caused by methylphenidate. The externalizing groups had  significantly lower SCL levels, and no differences were found between these  groups. It was concluded that differences in cortisol responsivity during stress  exposure are important in distinguishing within a group of children with  externalizing behavior between those with ODD and ADHD.

Author information: (1)New York University School of Medicine, USA.	This study investigated the development of attachment relationships in 38 foster  infant-caregiver dyads over the first 2 months of placement. We used the Parent  Attachment Diary to measure foster infants' daily attachment behaviors, the  Adult Attachment Interview to examine foster parents' attachment states of mind,  and Ainsworth's Strange Situation to capture attachment classifications. We  examined differences in diary scales (secure, avoidant, resistant, and  coherence) as they related to age at placement and foster parent attachment,  using hierarchical linear modeling and analyses of variance. The results  indicated infants with autonomous foster parents and infants placed at younger  ages showed higher early and overall levels of secure behavior, less avoidant  behavior, and more coherent attachment strategies compared to infants placed  with nonautonomous foster parents. Changes in attachment behaviors over time  were not predicted by the models; however, there was a significant decrease in  the daily coherence of attachment behaviors associated with Strange Situation  disorganization. Finally, we found significant concordance between the diary and  Strange Situation scales for secure and avoidant behaviors.	PMID: 15487595 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Factors associated with the unresolved classification of the Adult Attachment  Interview in women who have suffered stillbirth.	Hughes P(1), Turton P, Hopper E, McGauley GA, Fonagy P.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, UK.  p.hughes@sghms.ac.uk	The "unresolved" state of mind with respect to loss or trauma as assessed in the  Adult Attachment Interview is common in clinical and forensic groups, as well as  in mothers whose infants are classified as disorganized in their attachment  relationship to them. However, questions remain about what the unresolved state  represents and what factors predict the unresolved state. This case controlled  study reports on 64 women who had suffered stillbirth and who were pregnant with  their next child. The study explores attachment, psychiatric, and social factors  associated with the unresolved state or higher unresolved scores with respect to  stillbirth. Women who had experienced stillbirth were more likely to be  unresolved than control women. Although a similar number of stillbirth and  control women had experienced childhood trauma, only women who had experienced  stillbirth were unresolved with respect to this trauma, suggesting the  unresolved state may be evoked or reevoked by subsequent traumatic loss. Higher  unresolved scores in relation to stillbirth were predicted by childhood trauma,  poor support from family after the loss, and having a funeral for the infant.  The results are discussed in terms of the woman's sense of being causal in the  loss.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579404044487 PMID: 15115072 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA, USA. kmccabe@casrc.org	The present study tested several predictions related to the theory that girls  with conduct disorder (CD) follow a single delayed onset pathway. The following  hypotheses were tested among a high-risk, stratified random sample of youth who  used public services during a 6-month period: boys will be more likely to have  childhood onset CD (COCD) than girls; girls with COCD will be less common than  girls with adolescent onset CD (AOCD); COCD girls. AOCD girls, and COCD boys  will be similar in terms of risk profiles and AOCD boys will have a less severe  risk profile than COCD girls; and risk factors that differentiate between COCD  and AOCD among males will not differentiate between COCD and AOCD among females.  Among those youth who met the criteria for CD, males were significantly more  likely to have COCD than females. However, close to half of females with CD met  the criteria for the COCD subtype. Of the seven risk factors that were examined,  girls with COCD scored higher than COCD boys on three factors and higher than  AOCD girls on four factors; however, only one significant difference was found  between AOCD girls and COCD boys. Finally, risk factors appeared to  differentiate between COCD and AOCD groups in a similar way among males and  females. These findings suggest that COCD is not rare among females in public  service sectors, COCD girls can be distinguished from AOCD girls in terms of  risk factors, and risk factors for COCD among males are also relevant to  females.

Karmiloff-Smith A(1), Thomas M.	Author information: (1)Neurocognitive Development Unit, Institute of Child Health, London, United  Kingdom. a.karmiloff-smith@ich.ucl.ac.uk	The uneven cognitive phenotype in the adult outcome of Williams syndrome has led  some researchers to make strong claims about the modularity of the brain and the  purported genetically determined, innate specification of cognitive modules.  Such arguments have particularly been marshaled with respect to language. We  challenge this direct generalization from adult phenotypic outcomes to genetic  specification and consider instead how genetic disorders provide clues to the  constraints on plasticity that shape the outcome of development. We specifically  examine behavioral studies, brain imaging, and computational modeling of  language in Williams syndrome but contend that our theoretical arguments apply  equally to other cognitive domains and other developmental disorders. While  acknowledging that selective deficits in normal adult patients might justify  claims about cognitive modularity, we question whether similar, seemingly  selective deficits found in genetic disorders can be used to argue that such  cognitive modules are prespecified in infant brains. Cognitive modules are, in  our view, the outcome of development, not its starting point. We note that most  work on genetic disorders ignores one vital factor, the actual process of  ontogenetic development, and argue that it is vital to view genetic disorders as  proceeding under different neurocomputational constraints, not as demonstrations  of static modularity.

The behavioral neurogenetics of fragile X syndrome: analyzing  gene-brain-behavior relationships in child developmental psychopathologies.	Reiss AL(1), Dant CC.	Author information: (1)Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Child Development and  Behavioral Neurogenetics Research Center, Stanford University School of  Medicine, CA 94305-5719, USA. reiss@stanford.edu	Analyzing gene-brain-behavior linkages in childhood neurodevelopmental  disorders, a research approach called "behavioral neurogenetics," has provided  new insights into understanding how both genetic and environmental factors  contribute to complex variations in typical and atypical human development.  Research into etiologically more homogeneous disorders, such as fragile X  syndrome, in particular, allows the use of more precise metrics of genetic risk  so that we can more fully understand the complex pathophysiology of childhood  onset neurodevelopmental disorders. In this paper, we review our laboratory's  behavioral neurogenetics research by examining gene-brain-behavior relationships  in fragile X syndrome, a single-gene disorder that has become a  well-characterized model for studying neurodevelopmental dysfunction in  childhood. Specifically, we examine genetic influences, trajectories of  cognition and behavior, variation in brain structure and function, and  biological and environmental factors that influence developmental and cognitive  outcomes of children with fragile X. The converging approaches across these  multilevel scientific domains indicate that fragile X, which arises from  disruption of a single gene leading to the loss of a specific protein, is  associated with a cascade of aberrations in neurodevelopment, resulting in a  central nervous system that is suboptimal with respect to structure and  function. In turn, structural and functional brain alterations lead to early  disruption in emotion, cognition, and behavior in the child with fragile X. The  combination of molecular genetics, neuroimaging, and behavioral research have  advanced our understanding of the linkages between genetic variables,  neurobiological measures, IQ, and behavior. Our research and that of others  demonstrates that neurobehavior and neurocognition, genetics, and neuroanatomy  are all different views of the same intriguing biological puzzle, a puzzle that  today is rapidly emerging into a more complete picture of the intricate linkages  among gene, brain, and behavior in developing children. Understanding the  complex multilevel scientific perspective involved in fragile X will also  contribute to our understanding of normal development by highlighting  developmental events throughout the life span, thereby helping us to delineate  the boundaries of pathology.

Author information: (1)Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37203, USA. bahr.weiss@vanderbilt.edu	Most researchers and clinicians now agree that children and adolescents are able  to develop depressive disorders, and there also appears to be consensus that  developmental level has relatively little influence on the phenomenology of the  depression. The present paper examines the validity of this latter assumption  from methodological, theoretical, and empirical perspectives. We first review  reasons why there might be developmental differences in the symptoms that define  depression, and then discuss the implications and significance if such  differences do or do not exist. Next, we highlight methodological and design  issues relevant to the appropriate evaluation of this question. Then, we propose  that this broad developmental question actually is comprised of two  subquestions--one focusing on symptoms and the other focused at the syndrome  level-that have not yet been clearly differentiated in the field. Finally, after  conducting a meta-analysis of the current empirical literature and reviewing its  limitations, recommendations are made regarding future research in this area.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disordered boys' relationships with their  mothers and fathers: child, mother, and father perceptions.	Gerdes AC(1), Hoza B, Pelham WE.	Author information: (1)Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907-2004, USA.	Self-perceptions of parent-child relationship quality were examined for 142 boys  with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 55 control boys. Parent  perceptions were examined as well. Mothers and fathers of ADHD boys perceived  their relationships with their children more negatively than mothers and fathers  of control boys. Interestingly, despite these differences in parental  perceptions, ADHD boys did not differ from control boys in their perceptions of  their relationships with their parents. Further, when ADHD boys' perceptions  were compared directly to those of their parents, ADHD boys' reports were  positively enhanced relative to those of control parent-child dyads. Together,  these results may be viewed as providing support for a positive illusory bias in  the social self-perceptions of ADHD children.

Goldberg S(1), Benoit D, Blokland K, Madigan S.	Author information: (1)Psychiatry Research, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario,  Canada. sueg@sickkids.ca	The data for 197 mother-infant pairs from two longitudinal studies were analyzed  to assess relations between maternal attachment representations; atypical  maternal behavior, coded with a new tool. Atypical Maternal Behavior Instrument  for Assessment and Classification (AMBIANCE), and infant attachment. Both  maternal and infant attachment were systematically related to atypical maternal  behavior: mothers who were Unresolved on the Adult Attachment Interview and  those whose infants were disorganized in the Strange Situation Procedure engaged  in more atypical behaviors than those who were not Unresolved and whose infants  showed organized patterns of attachment, respectively. Regression analyses  indicated that when tested as a mediator, atypical maternal behavior as measured  on the AMBIANCE did not reduce the association between maternal Unresolved  status and infant disorganized attachment. This may, in part, reflect the fact  that our low-risk sample did not include enough cases in the risk categories.  These data provide preliminary empirical validation for the AMBIANCE and  strengthen the evidence for links between atypical maternal behavior and  disorganized attachment but indicate that in addition to maternal attachment  representations, other factors must contribute to atypical maternal behavior.

Selective processing of threatening information: effects of attachment  representation and anxiety disorder on attention and memory.	Zeijlmans van Emmichoven IA(1), van IJzendoorn MH, de Ruiter C, Brosschot JF.	Author information: (1)University of Amsterdam.	To investigate the effect of the mental representation of attachment on  information processing, 28 anxiety disorder outpatients, as diagnosed by the  Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Revised, were administered the Adult  Attachment Interview and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. They also completed  an emotional Stroop task with subliminal and supraliminal exposure conditions, a  free recall memory task, and a recognition test. All tasks contained  threatening, neutral, and positively valenced stimuli. A nonclinical comparison  group of 56 participants completed the same measures. Results on the Stroop task  showed color-naming interference for threatening words in the supraliminal  condition only. Nonclinical participants with insecure attachment  representations showed a global response inhibition to the Stroop task. Clinical  participants with secure attachment representations showed the largest Stroop  interference of the threatening words compared to the other groups. Results on  the free recall task showed superior recall of all types of stimuli by  participants with secure attachment representations. In the outpatient group,  participants with secure attachment representations showed superior recall of  threatening words on the free recall task, compared to insecure participants.  Results on the recognition task showed no differences between attachment groups.  We conclude that secure attachment representations are characterized by open  communication about and processing of threatening information, leading to less  defensive exclusion of negative material during the attentional stage of  information processing and to better recall of threatening information in a  later stage. Attachment insecurity, but not the type of insecurity, seems a  decisive factor in attention and memory processes.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579403000129 PMID: 12848443 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Developmental trajectories of boys' delinquent group membership and facilitation  of violent behaviors during adolescence.	Lacourse E(1), Nagin D, Tremblay RE, Vitaro F, Claes M.	Author information: (1)Carnegie Mellon University, USA. eric.lacourse@umontreal.ca	Being part of a delinquent group has been shown to facilitate the expression of  an individual's own delinquent propensities. However, this facilitation effect  has not been investigated from a developmental perspective within a population  heterogeneity model. Using a semiparametric mixture model with data from the  Montreal Longitudinal Experimental Study, this article addresses important  issues in the developmental trends of membership to delinquent groups. We  explore how the rate of violent behaviors follows delinquent peer group  trajectories and investigate a differential facilitation effect of delinquent  peers on violence across multiple developmental pathways. Results suggest that  25% of males followed a childhood or an adolescence delinquent group affiliation  trajectory. These two groups account far most of the violent acts assessed  during adolescence. In addition, the rate of violent behaviors follows these  developmental trajectories. Controlling for these delinquent group trajectories,  we also found that being involved in a delinquent group at any specific time  during adolescence is associated with an increased rate of violent behaviors,  and that leaving these groups results in a decrease in violent behaviors. This  facilitation effect appears homogeneous over time and across developmental  trajectories. Results are discussed from a social interactional perspective.

Reddy R(1), Rhodes JE, Mulhall P.	Author information: (1)University of Massachusetts, Boston 02125-3393, USA.	The influence of perceived teacher support on trajectories of depression and  self-esteem in middle school was examined using multigroup latent growth  cross-domain models. A longitudinal sample of 2,585 students was followed from  the sixth through the eighth grades. Students' perceptions of teacher support  and general self-esteem declined and depressive symptoms increased over the  course of middle school. We further found that, for both boys and girls, changes  in perceptions of teachers' support reliably predicted changes in both  self-esteem and depression. In particular, those students perceiving increasing  teacher support showed corresponding decreases in depressive symptoms and  increases in self-esteem. Gender differences were found for the initial levels  of both perceptions of teacher support and general self-esteem. A competing  model was also tested, which gave additional support for pathways of influence  from perceptions of teacher support to depression and self-esteem, rather than  the reverse. This study underscores the role of teacher support in facilitating  students' adjustment to middle school and highlights the importance of using  idiographic methodologies in the study of developmental processes. Implications  and future directions are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579403000075 PMID: 12848438 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Behavioral and  physiological indicators of empathic responding in 2-year-old children.	Gill KL(1), Calkins SD.	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Greensboro, 27412-6164, USA.	Ninety-nine 2-year-olds, out of a larger sample of 474 children, were classified  as high (n = 49) or low (n = 50) in externalizing (aggressive/destructive)  behaviors based on maternal reports assessed twice across a 2-month period.  During a laboratory assessment, these toddlers participated in two  empathy-eliciting tasks, from which affective, behavioral, and physiological  measures were derived. Relations among measures of empathy were examined both  within and across episodes and aggression groups. Analyses indicated that  different indices of empathy were related to each other, both within and across  empathy situations. In addition, aggressive children displayed more behaviors  indicative of empathy than did nonaggressive children. Finally, a pattern of  physiological responding to another's distress was evident across both groups of  children, and some results indicated that greater physiological regulation was  related to less empathy-related behavior. Results are discussed in terms of the  developing nature of empathy and its changing association with both  self-regulation and aggression.

O'Connor TG(1), Marvin RS, Rutter M, Olrick JT, Britner PA; English and Romanian  Adoptees Study Team.	Author information: (1)Institute of Psychiatry, London, UK. spjwtoc@iop.kcl.ac.uk	Child-parent attachment quality with an adoptive caregiver at age 4 years was  examined in a sample of 111 children adopted into the United Kingdom following  early severe deprivation in Romania and a comparison group of 52 nondeprived  within-United Kingdom adoptees. Findings indicated that, compared with  nondeprived adoptees, children who experienced early severe deprivation were  less likely to be securely attached and more likely to show atypical patterns of  attachment behavior; ordinary forms of insecure attachment were not associated  with deprivation. Within the sample of deprived adoptees, there was a  dose-response association between duration of deprivation and disturbances in  attachment behavior. In addition, a minority of children who experienced severe  early deprivation were classified as avoidant, secure, or dependent using  conventional classification strategies, despite also exhibiting atypical  patterns of attachment behaviors, and this was also more likely among children  exposed to prolonged deprivation. The results raise both theoretical and  methodological implications for attachment research on very deprived children.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579403000026 PMID: 12848433 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Delaware, Newark 19716, USA.  mdozier@udel.edu	All children who enter foster care have experienced disruptions in their  relationships with caregivers, and many have experienced maltreatment. Studying  the effects of these adverse early experiences can inform developmental theory.  In particular, insight can be provided regarding sensitive periods in the  development of attachment and self-regulatory capabilities. The quality of  surrogate caregivers varies as a function of both the intervention services  provided and foster parent characteristics. Studying the effects of foster  parent quality can suggest which aspects of child functioning are more or less  canalized at various developmental periods. This paper considers salient  developmental issues of infancy, preschool years, middle childhood, and  adolescence and examines ways in which these issues may present special  difficulties for foster children. Across development, foster care is associated  with difficulties regulating behaviors, emotions, and physiology. Thus,  conditions associated with foster care placement (e.g., disruptions in care,  maltreatment) appear to affect very basic and fundamental regulatory processes.  Interventions have been designed that target developmentally specific  manifestations of regulatory difficulties. Although the literature regarding  evidence-based interventions for foster parents is quite limited, preliminary  findings provide some evidence that nurturing, responsive care can serve to  partially remediate early deficits. These findings suggest that stable and  nonfrightening care is essential for normal development. Nonetheless, even in  the case of quite adverse early experience that results in problematic child  outcomes, there is some evidence that the development of many systems remains  relatively plastic.

Author information: (1)Institute for Juvenile Research, University of Illinois at Chicago, 60612,  USA.	This article reviews major issues of a developmental psychopathology  understanding of youth violence and related insights gained from violence  prevention efforts to date. Based in a perspective that emphasizes three areas  of knowledge, epidemiology, risk factors and models, and developmental  trajectories, findings are reviewed that help clarify theoretical propositions  about the developmental patterns, influences, and pathways related to youth  violence. Extant research is able to support several major contentions of basic  developmental psychopathology theories of youth violence. Support is most robust  for risk factors central to prevailing models of the development of youth  violence. In addition to noting current knowledge contributions, the review  suggests areas of needed additional analytic progress and theoretical extension  to refine knowledge and expand understanding of the development of violence risk  and its prevention.

Clingempeel WG(1), Henggeler SW.	Author information: (1)Family Services Research Center, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral  Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425, USA.	The design of effective interventions for antisocial adolescents has been  greatly influenced by research-based developmental theories. However, randomized  clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrating effectiveness of these treatments have  contributed minimally to alterations and refinements of these theories. In this  article, nine guidelines for research that may enhance the contributions of RCTs  to developmental theory are proposed: (1) use mediational analyses to test and  refine theories of change; (2) use moderator analyses to test differential  pathways to change; (3) assess change processes separately for different types  of antisocial behavior; (4) use constructive and dismantling designs to isolate  effects of intervention components on targeted mediators and outcomes; (5)  assess the time-sensitive nature of change mechanisms with theoretically  relevant spacing of multiple assessments and long-term follow-ups; (6) expand  the nomological net of developmental theories by assessing intervention effects  on nontargeted constructs; (7) use RCTs to disentangle direction of effects  questions in developmental theories; (8) conduct secondary analyses of RCTs to  assess extra-treatment influences on antisocial behavior; and (9) assess the  generalizability of mediator and moderator effects. Use of these guidelines may  promote a recursive and iterative relationship between RCTs and theory building.  Improved developmental theories may yield more effective interventions, and  theory-testing interventions may engender more comprehensive and better informed  theories.

Author information: (1)Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience, Rutgers University, Newark,  NJ 07102, USA. tallal@axon.rutgers.edu	Developmental language learning impairments (LLI) are one of the most prevalent  of all developmental disabilities, can occur in children for a wide variety of  reasons, and have been shown to co-occur frequently with other developmental  social, emotional and behavioral disorders, as well as with academic achievement  problems. Research pertaining to developmental LLI of unknown origin, with an  emphasis on the continuum between oral and written language impairment, is the  focus of this review. Given the complexity of language learning, research has  focused on multiple levels of analysis, including linguistic,  neuropsychological, genetic, neurobiological, and remediation studies. To date,  the vast majority of data on LLI derive from studies focused on a single level  of analysis. Although attempts have been made to integrate data across studies  and multiple levels of analysis, this has proven to be problematic, given the  heterogeneity of the subject populations used to study LLI, as well as the  differences in ages, degree of impairment, and types of impairment included in  each study. Given that LLI is a complex developmental disability, it is  suggested that future research would benefit from taking a multiple levels of  analysis approach with the same individuals, incorporating mathematical models  designed to analyze dynamically changing complex systems, and studying  individual differences in language learning, prospectively and longitudinally,  throughout the most dynamic stages of the process.

Self-regulatory processes in early personality development: a multilevel  approach to the study of childhood social withdrawal and aggression.	Calkins SD(1), Fox NA.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of North Carolina at Greensboro,  27402-6164, USA.	Self-regulatory processes are believed to be critical to early personality and  behavioral adjustment. Such processes can be observed on multiple levels,  including the physiological, attentional, emotional, cognitive, and  interpersonal domains of functioning. Data from several longitudinal studies  suggest links between early temperamental tendencies such as behavioral  inhibition and frustration tolerance, and regulatory developments at the levels  of physiological, attentional, and emotional regulation. Deficits in these  particular levels of self-regulation may underlie childhood social withdrawal  and aggression. Significant gaps remain in our knowledge of the pathways to  disordered behavior and the role that self-regulation plays in such pathways.  Suggestions are made for the ways in which future longitudinal studies might  address these gaps.	DOI: 10.1017/s095457940200305x PMID: 12349870 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Research suggests that disruptions in early caretaking can have long-term  effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which mediates the  stress response. Children of depressed mothers are at increased risk for  developing internalizing problems in part because of disruptions in their  caretaking environment. The present study investigated whether children of  depressed mothers exhibit elevated salivary cortisol levels. Salivary cortisol  samples were collected from 45 7- to 8-year-old children of mothers with a  history of depression and 29 children of nondepressed mothers. Samples were  collected soon after arrival to the laboratory and after a mild laboratory  stressor and at home after wakeup and before bedtime. Children who had elevated  levels of intemalizing symptoms and whose mothers had a history of depression  showed elevated laboratory baseline cortisol levels. Children who were reported  to have clinically significant internalizing symptoms were also more likely to  show an elevated stress response to a mild laboratory stressor. When the  longitudinal history of maternal depression was examined, matemal depression  during the child's first 2 years of life was the best predictor of elevations in  baseline cortisol at age 7 years. This study provides evidence that  internalizing symptoms exist in conjunction with a more reactive hormonal stress  system in children of depressed mothers. The results also provide preliminary  evidence that exposure to maternal depression in the first 2 years of life may  be related to children's cortisol levels later in life.

Early intervention for low birth weight, preterm infants: the role of negative  emotionality in the specification of effects.	Blair C(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Pennsylvania State  University, University Park 16802-6504, USA. cbb11@psu.edu	This study examined the relation of negative emotionality in infancy to child  social and cognitive developmental outcomes among low birth weight (LBW) preterm  infants participating in the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP), a  comprehensive compensatory education intervention beginning in infancy and  lasting through age 3 years. In this analysis, intervention effects at age 36  months on maternal report of child behavior as assessed by the Child Behavior  Checklist externalizing and internalizing scales and on intelligence as measured  by the Stanford-Binet scale were largest among children characterized by higher  levels of negative emotionality in infancy. Findings indicate that for LBW  preterm infants characterized by negative emotionality at age 12 months the  intervention was associated with a twofold decrease in the occurrence of  clinically meaningful levels of behavior problems at age 3 years and a fourfold  decrease in the occurrence of a high-risk profile in which both internalizing  and externalizing scores are in the clinically meaningful range. The  intervention was also associated with a fivefold decrease in the occurrence of  IQ < or = 75 at age 3 years among children with higher levels of negative  emotionality and heavier LBW (2001-2500 g). However, specific aspects of  temperamental difficulty such as fearfulness and anger were related to  internalizing and externalizing, respectively, in both the intervention and  control groups. Findings are consistent with research linking negative  emotionality in infancy with social and cognitive developmental outcomes in  early childhood among normal birth weight infants. Results suggest the need for  further attention to child temperament in early intervention research.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579402002079 PMID: 12030694 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)University at Buffalo, State University of New York, USA.  eiden@ria.buffalo.edu	This study examined the association between fathers' alcoholism and other risk  factors such as parental depression, family conflict, infant temperament, and  parent-infant attachment. The quality of parent-infant interactions was  hypothesized to be a proximal mediator of the associations among alcoholism and  other risk factors and attachment. The participants were 223 families (104  nonalcoholic families and 119 alcoholic families) with 12-month-old infants  recruited through birth records. Infants in families with two parents with  alcohol problem had significantly higher rates of insecure attachment with both  parents. Structural Equations Modeling indicated that the fathers' alcohol  problem was associated with lower paternal sensitivity (higher negative affect,  lower positive engagement, and lower sensitive responding) during father-infant  play interactions, and this in tum was associated with higher risk for infant  attachment insecurity with fathers. The association between the fathers' alcohol  problem and infant attachment security with the mother was mediated by matemal  depression, and matemal alcohol problems and family conflict were associated  with maternal sensitivity during play interactions. These results indicate that  the fathers' alcoholism is associated with higher family risk including the  quality of the parent-infant relationship; infant attachment develops in a  family context; and this context has a significant association with attachment  security.

Osterling JA(1), Dawson G, Munson JA.	Author information: (1)Center on Human Development and Disability, University of Washington, Seattle  98195, USA. osterlin@u.washington.edu	Previous work based on observations of home videotapes indicates that  differences can be detected between infants with autism spectrum disorder and  infants with typical development at 1 year of age. The present study addresses  the question of whether autism can be distinguished from mental retardation by 1  year of age. Home videotapes of first birthday parties from 20 infants later  diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, 14 infants later diagnosed with mental  retardation (without autism), and 20 typically developing infants were coded by  blind raters with respect to the frequencies of specific social and  communicative behaviors and repetitive motor actions. Results indicated that  1-year-olds with autism spectrum disorder can be distinguished from 1-year-olds  with typical development and those with mental retardation. The infants with  autism spectrum disorder looked at others and oriented to their names less  frequently than infants with mental retardation. The infants with autism  spectrum disorder and those with mental retardation used gestures and looked to  objects held by others less frequently and engaged in repetitive motor actions  more frequently than typically developing infants. These results indicate that  autism can be distinguished from mental retardation and typical development by 1  year of age.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579402002031 PMID: 12030690 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Benefits and pitfalls in the merging of disciplines: the example of  developmental psychopathology and the study of persons with autism.	Burack JA(1), Iarocci G, Bowler D, Mottron L.	Author information: (1)Department of Educational Psychology, McGill University, Montréal, Québec,  Canada.	Recent advances in the discipline of developmental psychopathology highlight the  contributions of developmental thought to the study of persons with autism. This  article briefly outlines primary developmental innovations in theory,  methodology, and the interpretation of findings. Specifically. we discuss two  sets of issues that arise from the general notion of developmental level. One  set is relevant to the choice of persons that comprise the comparison group and  the other to the various implications of the subjects' levels of functioning. In  sum, we contend that researchers need to frame their empirical work within the  context of developmental theory and methodology and interpret their findings  accordingly. This will lead to scientifically compelling work and an  increasingly heuristic approach to the study of persons with autism.	DOI: 10.1017/s095457940200202x PMID: 12030689 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Duke University, Psychology Department, Durham, NC 27708, USA. rgf2@duke.edu	Externalizing behavior problems of 124 adolescents were assessed across Grades  7-11. In Grade 9, participants were also assessed across social-cognitive  domains after imagining themselves as the object of provocations portrayed in  six videotaped vignettes. Participants responded to vignette-based questions  representing multiple processes of the response decision step of social  information processing. Phase 1 of our investigation supported a two-factor  model of the response evaluation process of response decision (response  valuation and outcome expectancy). Phase 2 showed significant relations between  the set of these response decision processes, as well as response selection,  measured in Grade 9 and (a) externalizing behavior in Grade 9 and (b)  externalizing behavior in Grades 10-11, even after controlling externalizing  behavior in Grades 7-8. These findings suggest that on-line behavioral judgments  about aggression play a crucial role in the maintenance and growth of aggressive  response tendencies in adolescence.

Granger DA(1), Hood KE, Dreschel NA, Sergeant E, Likos A.	Author information: (1)Department of Biobehavioral Health, The Pennsylvania State University,  University Park 16802, USA. dag11@psu.edu	The origins of individual differences in social development are examined in  relation to early stress (immune challenge) and social milieu (maternal  behavior) in a genetic-developmental analysis using an animal model. Neonatal  male mice (5 or 6 days of age) from two lines of mice selectively bred for high  versus low levels of inter-male aggressive behavior received a standard immune  challenge (i.p. injections of 0.05 mg/kg endotoxin or saline). Animals were  reared by their line-specific biological dam or by a foster dam from a line bred  without selection. Adult levels of social behaviors were assessed in a dyadic  test (age 45-50 days). Mice from the high-aggressive line show more  developmental sensitivity to immune challenge than mice from the low-aggressive  line, and line differences persist regardless of the early maternal environment.  As adults, endotoxin-treated mice from the high-aggressive line have lower  levels of aggressive behavior, longer latency to attack, and higher rates of  socially reactive and inhibited behaviors compared to saline controls.  Developmental effects of endotoxin in the low-aggressive line are minimal:  endotoxin increases socially reactive behaviors, compared to saline controls,  but only for mice reared by their biological dams. Rearing by foster dams  increases social exploration in the low-aggressive line. The findings raise  novel questions regarding the openness of behavioral systems to effects of  nonobvious but omnipresent features of the environment, such as antigenic load,  how these effects are integrated to affect social development and  psychopathology, and the nature of intrinsic factors that contribute to  individual differences in sensitivity to early stressors.

Author information: (1)Clinical Neuroendocrinology Branch, National Institute of Mental Health,  Bethesda, MD 20892-1284, USA. meyer104@gold.tc.umn.edu	From a transactional developmental perspective, the authors review findings from  studies of animals and humans regarding a proposed relation between stress  system abnormalities and major depression. The stress system has evolved to  promote successful adaptation across the life span, but disruptions in its  functioning may increase the risk of pathological outcomes. Emphasis is placed  on the role of prenatal and early postnatal experience in contributing to  individual differences in postnatal stress reactivity, which may interact with  cognitive and psychosocial vulnerabilities to increase susceptibility to later  onset of depression. Findings regarding cognitive, psychosocial, and medical  sequelae of depression are also reviewed, with a focus on the possible mediating  role of the stress system. The authors highlight the importance of  multidisciplinary, longitudinal studies in attempting to gain a deeper  understanding of the complex developmental processes involved in the onset and  course of depression.

Gunnar MR(1), Vazquez DM.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455,  USA.	Since the work of Hans Selye, stress has been associated with increased activity  of the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (LHPA) axis. Recently, a  number of studies in adults have shown that this neuroendocrine axis may be  hyporesponsive in a number of stress-related states. Termed hypocortisolism, the  paradoxical suppression of the LHPA axis under conditions of trauma and  prolonged stress presently challenges basic concepts in stress research. Adverse  conditions that produce elevated cortisol levels early in life are hypothesized  to contribute to the development of hypocortisolism in adulthood. However, as  reviewed in this paper, hypocortisolism also may be a common phenomenon early in  human childhood. Although preliminary at this point, the ubiquity of these  findings is striking. We argue that developmental studies are needed that help  explicate the origins of low cortisol and to determine whether the development  of hypocortisolism is, in fact, preceded by periods of frequent or chronic  activation of the LHPA axis. We also argue that developmental researchers who  incorporate measures of salivary cortisol into their studies of at-risk  populations need to be aware of the hypocortisolism phenomenon. Lower than  expected cortisol values should not necessarily be relegated to the file drawer  because they contradict the central dogma that stress must be associated with  elevations in cortisol. Lastly, we note that evidence of low cortisol under  adverse early life conditions in humans adds to the importance of understanding  the implications of hypocortisolism for health and development.

Shipman KL(1), Zeman J.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Georgia, Athens 30602-3013, USA.  kshipman@arches.uga.edu	This study investigated the socialization of children's emotion regulation in 25  physically maltreating and 25 nonmaltreating mother-child dyads. Maltreating  mothers and their 6- to 12-year-old children were recruited from two parenting  programs affiliated with Children's Protective Services with a control group  matched on race, SES, child gender, and child age. Children and their mothers  were interviewed individually about their (a) management of emotional  expression. (b) strategies for coping with emotional arousal, and (c)  anticipated consequences following emotional displays. Compared to controls,  maltreated children expected less maternal support in response to their  emotional displays, reported being less likely to display emotions to their  mothers, and generated fewer effective coping strategies for anger. Maltreating  mothers indicated less understanding of children's emotional displays and fewer  effective strategies for helping children to cope with emotionally arousing  situations than nonmaltreating mothers. Further, findings indicated that  maternal socialization practices (e.g., providing support in response to  children's emotional display, generating effective coping strategies for their  child) mediate the relation between child maltreatment and children's regulation  of emotional expression and emotional arousal. These findings suggest that  children's emotion regulation strategies are influenced by their relationship  with their social environment (e.g.. physically maltreating, nonmaltreating) and  that the experience of a physically maltreating relationship may interfere with  children's emotional development.

Author information: (1)Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge, UK.	Executive tasks typically contain a prepotent lure. In addition, they require  individuals either to (a) follow arbitrary procedures or (b) update their model  of the physical world. Recent research suggests that children with autism may be  challenged only by executive tasks of the former kind (containing arbitrary  rules). We asked whether this continues to be true when there is no prepotent  lure, comparing performance on (a) a task with arbitrariness but without  prepotency with (b) a task with both features and (c) a task with neither. The  participants with autism performed at a lower level than comparison groups on  the first and second task but not on the third task. This outcome is consistent  with the view that autism is associated with difficulties in following arbitrary  procedures per se. We try to locate difficulties with acting on the basis  arbitrary rules in relation to more mainstream ideas about autistic executive  dysfunction.

Author information: (1)Department of Maternal and Child Health, Harvard University School of Public  Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA.	Three hundred sixty-three school-aged children from maritally violent and  nonviolent families were interviewed about their friendship networks, frequency  of social contact, the interpersonal quality of their friendships, and hostile  attributional biases. Mothers answered items from the Child Behavior Checklist  about peer conflict. Children did not differ on the number of friends they  claimed or their frequency of contact with peers. However, children exposed to  marital violence reported feeling more lonely and having more conflict with a  close friend. Their mothers also reported them as having more problems with  peers. In addition, children with punitive mothers had more conflict with a best  friend. Residing in a shelter added further to children's feelings of  loneliness, with one third having no best friend. Children's attributional  biases were unrelated to the quality of their peer relations or any other index  of peer functioning. Results are discussed in terms of an attachment framework.  Findings confirm that it is important to examine the quality of relationships to  determine how children at risk fare in their social lives.

Vondra JI(1), Shaw DS, Swearingen L, Cohen M, Owens EB.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology in Education, University of Pittsburgh, PA  15260-7478, USA.	Relations between attachment and child emotional and behavioral regulation were  studied longitudinally in a sample of 223 children from urban, low-income  families. Attachment in the Strange Situation at 12 and 18 months was scored  using the infant classification system and at 24 months was scored using a  preschool classification system. Only modest stability was found in attachment  whether within or across classification systems, with the percentage of insecure  attachments consistently increasing over time. Results indicated both concurrent  and predictive associations with indices of child regulation based on observer  ratings or maternal report. However, only the 24-month classification predicted  maternal report of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems at age 3.5  years. with additional variance accounted for by selected measures of child  emotional and behavior regulation from the same assessment. Attachment security  (B) and atypical attachment classifications (D, A/C, and AD) appear to provide  the most consistently useful information about child functioning. Results are  discussed in terms of continuity and change from the perspective of  developmental psychopathology.	DOI: 10.1017/s095457940100102x PMID: 11346048 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The focus of this article is on the interface between research on resilience-a  construct representing positive adaptation despite adversity--and the  applications of this work to the development of interventions and social  policies. Salient defining features of research on resilience are delineated, as  are various advantages, limitations, and precautions linked with the application  of the resilience framework to developing interventions. For future applied  efforts within this tradition, a series of guiding principles are presented  along with exemplars of existing programs based on the resilience paradigm. The  article concludes with discussions of directions for future work in this area,  with emphases on an enhanced interface between science and practice, and a  broadened scope of resilience-based interventions in terms of the types of  populations, and the types of adjustment domains, that are encompassed.

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455,  USA.	This article summarizes the research on the developmental outcomes of  postinstitutionalized children and discusses the implications for social policy.  Postinstitutionalized children often reach their adoptive families with varying  degrees of physical growth retardation, cognitive delays, and socioemotional  problems. Many children demonstrate remarkable recovery following adoption.  Unfortunately, some of the children continue to display significant problems  that require professional intervention. It appears that the children's recovery  may be influenced by their early experiences with their birth family and in  institutional care, and there is suggestive evidence that postadoption  experiences also play a role. These findings indicate that preadoption and  postadoption services may support the outcome of postinstitutionalized children.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579400004077 PMID: 11202039 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Thompson RA(1), Ontai L.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Nebraska, Lincoln 68588-0308, USA.	Social support can have significant stress-preventive and stress-buffering  benefits for troubled individuals in everyday circumstances. Consequently, it is  not surprising that many therapeutic and preventive programs enlist social  support to address problems of child and family psychopathology, especially in  the context of "two-generation interventions" that seek to improve child  well-being by strengthening parental functioning and parent-child relationships.  Home visitation programs are the best known of these two-generation strategies  and have become the focus of state-level and national efforts to support  families and prevent harm to children. The conclusions of basic research studies  on social support converge significantly with the findings of evaluation studies  of the impact of home visitation programs to yield important new insights into  the conditions in which formal social support is likely to be beneficial. or  ineffective, in improving child and family well-being. Both basic and applied  research literatures emphasize the importance of linking formal social support  to informal social networks in extended families, neighborhoods, and  communities, and attending to the complex reactions of the recipients of support  and the needs of support providers. These studies are reviewed and evaluated to  highlight the connections between social support, developmental psychopathology.  and social policy.

Author information: (1)Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge, UK.	This article considers whether Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism  (HFA) necessarily leads to disability or whether AS/HFA simply leads to  "difference." It concludes that the term "difference" in relation to AS/ HFA is  a more neutral, value-free, and fairer description than terms such as  "impairment," "deficiency," or "disability"; that the term "disability" only  applies to the lower functioning cases of autism; but that the term "disability"  may need to be retained for ASIHFA as long as the legal framework provides  financial and other support only for individuals with a disability. Two models  are summarized which attempt to define in what way individuals with AS/HFA are  "different": the central coherence model, and the folk psychology-folk physics  model. The challenge for research is to test the value of such models and to  precisely characterize the differences in cognitive style.	PMID: 11014749 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Certain misconceptions, arising from  research traditions initiated by Francis Galton on the one hand and G. Stanley  Hall on the other, may now be set aside in the light of new evidence. Three  important findings promise a new synthesis. First, while each of us is born with  about 100,000 genes that, under ordinary circumstances, do not change, the  expression of these genes on behavior is dynamic. Some genetic influences are  expressed early in development, but others are manifest many years later.  Second, genetic factors often account not only for some of the individual  differences in the measures of adjustments we typically use to monitor  development but also for individual differences in environmental experiences  that covary with those measures of adjustment. Indeed, genetic factors have been  found to account for a surprising amount of covariance between measures of the  social environment and of adjustment in young children, adolescents, and adults.  Third, the expression of genetic influences are very malleable and responsive to  the social environment. These new findings are revealing specific mechanisms for  the interplay of genetic and social environmental factors in four domains.  First, the social environment may play both a necessary and specific role in the  expression of particular genetic influences on a range of behaviors from  depression to social responsibility. Second, an understanding of the interplay  between the social environment and genetics may lead to a clearer definition of  the phenotypic manifestations of particular genetic influences. Third, we  will-as a result of these studies-have a clearer fix on the timing of important  events and their sequence in development. Fourth, this new genre of work  promises to illumine more completely mechanisms by which the social environment  influences development independent of genetic influence.

Scheuffgen K(1), Happé F, Anderson M, Frith U.	Author information: (1)Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Department of Psychology, University  College London, UK.	The uneven profile of performance on standard assessments of intelligence and  the high incidence of savant skills have prompted interest in the nature of  intelligence in autism. The present paper reports the first group study of speed  of processing in children with autism (IQ 1 SD below average) using an  inspection time task. The children with autism showed inspection times as fast  as an age-matched group of young normally developing children (IQ 1 SD above  average). They were also significantly faster than mentally handicapped children  without autism of the same age, even when these groups were pairwise matched on  Wechsler IQ. To the extent that IT tasks tap individual differences in basic  processing efficiency, children with autism in this study appear to have  preserved information processing capacity despite poor measured IQ. These  findings have implications for the role of general and specific cognitive  systems in knowledge and skill acquisition: far from showing that children with  autism are unimpaired, we suggest that our data may demonstrate the vital role  of social insight in the development of manifest "intelligence."

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Missouri-Columbia, 65211, USA.  sherk@missouri.edu	In 1987, we began a longitudinal study of the offspring of alcoholic parents and  have been following this group of young adults from their freshman year in  college throughout their transition into later young adulthood. The goal of this  review is to highlight some of the findings we consider most important and  relevant to the development of pathological alcohol involvement in young  adulthood. Courses of pathological alcohol involvement in young adulthood are  outlined. Predictors of both the development and course of pathological alcohol  use in young adulthood are also addressed, including family history of  alcoholism, personality, alcohol use motivations, and role transitions. While  certainly a problem in its own right, pathological alcohol involvement can also  affect the attainment of important life tasks and success in various life roles.  Consequently, we also examine the effects of pathological alcohol involvement on  later role transitions and role attainment. Finally, prevention, policy, and  treatment issues surrounding this stage of life are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579499002394 PMID: 10624733 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The relation of adolescent substance use to young adult autonomy, positive  activity involvement, and perceived competence.	Chassin L(1), Pitts SC, DeLucia C.	Author information: (1)Psychology Department, Arizona State University, Tempe 85287-1104, USA.  Laurie.Chassin@asu.edu	The current paper uses data from a longitudinal study of a high-risk sample to  test the relation between adolescent alcohol and drug use and later young adult  autonomy, positive activity involvement, and perceived competence. Participants  (children of alcoholics and demographically matched controls) were assessed in  three annual interviews in adolescence (mean age: 12.7 years at Time 1) and then  again 5-7 years later, in young adulthood (median age: 20 years). Path analyses  and latent growth curve models tested the effects of adolescent substance use on  both self-reported and collateral-reported outcomes, controlling for correlated  risk factors (parental alcoholism, adolescent psychopathology, and parental  support), preexisting levels of the outcome, and concurrent young adult  substance use. Results showed that adolescent drug use had a significant, unique  negative effect on later autonomy and perceived competence. Alcohol use effects  were more complex. Adolescent heavy drinking was associated with less positive  adult outcomes, but more so in collateral reports than in self-reported  outcomes. Moreover, young adult heavy drinking was either uncorrelated with or  positively correlated with higher levels of perceived competence, suggesting  different developmental significance of alcohol use in adolescence than in young  adulthood.

Behavioral disinhibition and the development of substance-use disorders:  findings from the Minnesota Twin Family Study.	Iacono WG(1), Carlson SR, Taylor J, Elkins IJ, McGue M.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.	One variant of substance-use disorder is characterized by behavioral  disinhibition. In this report, we martial evidence for a model for the  development of this variant. We hypothesize that genetic liability for this  variant is reflected in a spectrum of risk indicators linked to the inability or  unwillingness to inhibit behavioral impulses. Included in this spectrum are  personality traits suggesting low constraint, and externalizing psychopathology,  including conduct, oppositional defiant, and attention-deficit disorder in  children and antisocial personality disorder and behavior in adults. We further  hypothesize that these individual differences in behavioral disinhibition are  manifestations of underlying central nervous system processes associated with  various psychophysiological anomalies, some of which may index genetic risk for  substance abuse. Support for the model is derived from the analysis of findings  from the Minnesota Twin Family Study, an epidemiological investigation of  approximately 2,700 adolescent twins and their parents.

Heterogeneity of risk aggregation for alcohol problems between early and middle  childhood: nesting structure variations.	Wong MM(1), Zucker RA, Puttler LI, Fitzgerald HE.	Author information: (1)University of Michigan, Department of Psychiatry and Alcohol Research Center,  Ann Arbor, 48108-3318, USA. mmwong@umich.edu	We examined how family and child risk factors jointly affected stability and  change in externalizing behavior over time in a prospective study of eventual  alcohol use disorder. Study participants were community-recruited alcoholic and  control families, and their initially preschool-aged male and female children (N  = 335). Family risk varied as a function of both parental alcoholism (ALC) and  antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and was evaluated for both parents. Child  risk was characterized by a set of risky temperament attributes pertaining to  high activity, high reactivity, and low attention span. Externalizing behavior  was used as the proxy indicator for later alcohol problems. For children in the  high family risk group (involving current ALC in both parents or current ALC +  ASPD comorbidity or both), child risk when children were 3-5 years old (Wave 1)  directly predicted externalizing behavior when children were 6-8 years old (Wave  2), even when Wave 1 child risk was controlled for. In addition, parents'  negative interaction with children at Wave 1 mediated the effect of child risky  temperament on Wave 2 externalizing behavior. No such pattern was observed in  the low family risk group, where only autostability effects were predictive of  outcomes at Wave 2. The importance of nesting structure as an ingredient in the  epigenesis of risk was discussed. Its particular relevance in understanding the  process of risk transmission among offspring from antisocial alcoholic families  was emphasized.

Beckwith L(1), Howard J, Espinosa M, Tyler R.	Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, University of California at Los Angeles, 90095,  USA.	The course of severe depressive symptoms from pregnancy to 6 months postpartum,  as well as the occurrence of severe paranoid symptoms prenatally, were examined  by the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory I and the Beck Depression Inventory,  in 78 women who were heavy, chronic cocaine users and who retained custody of  their children after birth. Six months postpartum, the quality of caregiving was  observed and assessed in the home, and the children were assessed on the Bayley  MDI Index in the laboratory. Mothers who were depressed and paranoid prenatally,  regardless of whether the depression continued to 6 months postpartum, were less  sensitive in caregiving than women without severe symptoms of paranoia or  depression during pregnancy or those who reported only depression that lifted by  6 months postpartum. Mothers who were depressed prenatally and continued to be  depressed by 6 months postpartum, regardless of the presence or absence of  paranoia, had infants who earned lower Bayley MDI scores than the offspring of  women without severe psychological symptoms or women whose depression had  lifted. Severe depressive symptoms during pregnancy, if they did not continue to  6 months postpartum, did not appear to adversely influence either caregiving or  infant functioning.

Tarter R(1), Vanyukov M, Giancola P, Dawes M, Blackson T, Mezzich A, Clark DB.	Author information: (1)Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213,  USA.	The etiology of early age onset substance use disorder (SUD), an Axis I  psychiatric illness, is examined from the perspective of the multifactorial  model of complex disorders. Beginning at conception, genetic and environment  interactions produce a sequence of biobehavioral phenotypes during development  which bias the ontogenetic pathway toward SUD. One pathway to SUD is theorized  to emanate from a deviation in somatic and neurological maturation, which, in  the context of adverse environments, predisposes to affective and behavioral  dysregulation as the cardinal SUD liability-contributing phenotype.  Dysregulation progresses via epigenesis from difficult temperament in infancy to  conduct problems in childhood to substance use by early adolescence and to  severe SUD by young adulthood.

Cannon TD(1), Rosso IM, Bearden CE, Sanchez LE, Hadley T.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles 90095-1563,  USA.	A number of lines of evidence converge in implicating neurodevelopmental  processes in the etiology and epigenesis of schizophrenia. In this study we used  a prospective, longitudinal design to examine whether adverse obstetric  experiences predict schizophrenia and whether there is a deviant  functional-developmental trajectory during the first 7 years of life among  individuals who manifest schizophrenia as adults. The 9,236 members of the  Philadelphia cohort of the National Collaborative Perinatal Project were  screened for mental health service utilization in adulthood, and chart reviews  were performed to establish diagnoses according to DSM-IV criteria. The risk for  schizophrenia increased linearly with the number of hypoxia-associated obstetric  complications but was unrelated to maternal infection during pregnancy or fetal  growth retardation. Preschizophrenic cases (and their unaffected siblings who  were also cohort members) manifested cognitive impairment, abnormal involuntary  movements and coordination deficits, and poor social adjustment during  childhood. There was no evidence of intraindividual decline in any domain, but  preschizophrenic cases did show deviance on an increasing number of functional  indicators with age. Together, these findings suggest that both genetic and  obstetric factors participate in creating a neural diathesis to schizophrenia,  the phenotypic expressions of which are age dependent, probably reflecting the  maturational status of a number of interconnected brain systems.

Author information: (1)Social Science Research Institute, Allan Hancock Foundation, University of  Southern California, Los Angeles 90089-0375, USA. jwatson@rcf.usc.edu	Our findings in the Helsinki Influenza Study and the Danish Forty Year Study  lead us to conclude that a 2nd-trimester maternal influenza infection may  increase risk for adult schizophrenia or adult major affective disorder. More  recently we have also reported an increase of unipolar depression among  offspring who were exposed prenatally to a severe earthquake (7.8 on the Richter  scale) in Tangshan, China. Among the earthquake-exposed males (but not the  females), we observed a significantly greater depression response for those  individuals exposed during the 2nd trimester of gestation. These findings  suggest that maternal influenza infection and severe maternal stress may operate  (in different ways) as teratogens, disrupting the development of the fetal brain  and increasing risk for developing schizophrenia or depression in adulthood.

Author information: (1)Center for Neurobiology and Behavior, University of Pennsylvania.  alveus@mail.med.upenn.edu	Growing epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neurobiological evidence  indicates that abnormalities in brain development play determining roles in the  pathobiology of schizophrenia. Neuropathological research has made significant  progress in delineating cellular and molecular abnormalities in schizophrenia  that have relevance to neurodevelopment. This paper reviews the  neurodevelopmental processes of neurogenesis, neuronal migration,  differentiation, synaptogenesis, neuron and synaptic pruning, and myelination  and the reported neuropathological findings in schizophrenia that may be a  consequence of disturbances in these processes. While many neuropathological  findings in schizophrenia are controversial or await confirmation, reported  abnormalities in neuron density, number and morphology, cytoarchitecture,  dendritic arbors and spines, synapse-related proteins, and the well-established  absence of gliosis or any other evidence of neurodegeneration or neural injury  all provide support for the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia.

The effects of stress on memory and the hippocampus throughout the life cycle:  implications for childhood development and aging.	Bremner JD(1), Narayan M.	Author information: (1)Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. j.bremner@yale.edu	Studies in animals showing hippocampal atrophy and associated memory deficits in  stress and aging have implications for stress and aging in humans. Clinical  studies in traumatized human populations with posttraumatic stress disorder  (PTSD) have replicated studies in animals, showing reduction in volume of the  hippocampus measured with magnetic resonance imaging and associated memory  deficits. Trauma at different stages of development (early childhood abuse  versus trauma in later life due to combat) may influence the nature of memory  deficits and hippocampal atrophy. Studies in aging human subjects are consistent  with animal studies, although future research is needed in this area. The  similarities between biological findings related to cortisol and the hippocampus  in stress and aging in both animal and human studies raises the question of  whether PTSD can be seen as a form of accelerated aging. Evidence that stress  affects the hippocampus and the capacity for learning has broad implications for  public health policy, underlying the need for additional resources in this  important area and a reexamination of our understanding of factors influencing  academic achievement.

Author information: (1)Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center,  NY 10468, USA. golier.julia@bronx.va.gov	This article reviews memory-related impairments in trauma survivors with  posttraumatic stress disorder and their possible association to neuroendocrine  alterations seen in this disorder. The neuroendocrine profile in PTSD first  described in chronically ill combat veterans is characterized by lower basal  cortisol levels, higher glucocorticoid receptor number, enhanced sensitivity to  exogenous steroids, and increased variation in basal cortisol levels over the  diurnal cycle. The generalizability and time course of these neuroendocrine  alterations are explored in longitudinal studies and studies in other  traumatized populations. These studies suggest that at least some aspects of  this neuroendocrine profile can also be seen in other populations, including  women, children, and victims of childhood trauma. Additionally, the alterations  may be present early in the course of illness, perhaps even in the immediate  aftermath of trauma, and may continue to be manifest in elderly trauma  survivors. The mechanisms by which these neuroendocrine alterations may  influence the formation and processing of traumatic memories are discussed.

Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, NY 14608, USA.  mlynch@ican.net	Research on the effects of child maltreatment and exposure to community violence  suggests that children who experience these types of traumatic events may be at  risk for alterations and biases in attention and memory similar to those that  have been observed in adults suffering from traumatic stress reactions. Along  these lines, attachment theory posits that representational models of  relationships also may act as moderators of similar cognitive biases by  selectively guiding children's attention to and processing of interpersonal  stimuli. Building upon the trauma and attachment literatures, the present  investigation examined the links among trauma, representational models of  caregivers, and children's memory for mother-relevant information using an  incidental recall task in a sample of maltreated (n = 71) and nonmaltreated (n =  102) children between the ages of 8 and 13 years. Results were consistent with  the hypothesis that experiences of trauma and representational models of  caregivers are associated with differences in the way children process and  retrieve information about positive and negative mother attribute words. In  particular, experiences of trauma initially were associated with increased  insecurity in children's representational models. Moreover, the interaction of  traumatic experience and security of mental representation predicted children's  recall for mother attribute words: victimized children with insecure models  recalled the highest proportion of negative mother stimuli. Trauma and mental  representation did not have a consistent effect on structurally encoded aspects  of recall. Results were discussed in terms of the ways in which children who  have experienced trauma process information about their worlds. The importance  of assessing functioning in multiple developmental domains when studying memory  also was discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579498001849 PMID: 9886224 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.  WKE@WJH.Harvard.edu	Because nearly all human behavior depends to some degree on functioning of the  memory system, progress in understanding the diverse psychopathological effects  of trauma must be expected to reflect the state of research and theory on human  memory. An informal survey of literature on research in psychopathology reveals  increasing attention to processes of memory and cognition but an absence of  citations of the models of memory that subsume research results and mediate  their applications. In this article, a series of steps is taken with the aim of  redressing this situation. The first is an overview of contemporary models of  memory. From these a set of widely supported assumptions about basic processes  and structures is abstracted to form a composite model, which is illustrated in  application to several major research paradigms. Finally, consideration is given  to implications of the composite model for effects of psychopathological trauma  and for some aspects of the maturation and decline of memory functions  throughout the life span.

Author information: (1)University of Ghent, Gent, Belgium. Herbert.Roeyers@rug.ac.be	There is growing scientific interest in the precursors to the ability of  conceiving other people's minds. The present study investigates two candidate  precursors, imitation and joint attention, in young children with autism and a  control group of nonautistic children with a developmental delay. Children with  autism were found to be impaired or delayed in both abilities. Gestural and  procedural imitation were significantly related to mental age and chronological  age in subjects with autism. Although the evidence for an autism-specific  deficit appears to be stronger in the domain of joint-attention behaviors than  it is in the domain of imitation, it seems premature to reject imitation as a  possible precursor to the development of mindreading skills. Systematic  investigations of the imitation deficit in autism are urgently needed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579498001680 PMID: 9741676 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Schneider ML(1), Clarke AS, Kraemer GW, Roughton EC, Lubach GR, Rimm-Kaufman S,  Schmidt D, Ebert M.	Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA.	In this study, we assessed behavioral responses to social separation at 8 months  of age and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of biogenic amines and  metabolites at 8 and 18 months of age in 12 rhesus monkeys derived from either  stressed or undisturbed pregnancies. Compared to controls from undisturbed  pregnancies, prenatal stress-derived monkeys had higher concentrations of  3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in  CSF than controls. Norepinephrine and MHPG response to stress were both  correlated between 8 and 18 months of age. There were few group differences in  behavior during social separation; however, several behavioral differences  between groups were found when monkeys were reunited with cage mates. Prenatally  stressed monkeys spent more time clinging to their surrogates and exploring  (including eating and drinking), while controls showed more locomotion and  social play with their cage mates. Collectively, our findings suggest that  chronic unpredictable psychological stress during pregnancy has long-lasting  effects on noradrenergic and dopaminergic activity and behavior in the offspring  of gestationally stressed primate mothers.

Aber JL(1), Jones SM, Brown JL, Chaudry N, Samples F.	Author information: (1)National Center for Children in Poverty, Columbia School of Public Health,  New York, NY 10032, USA. jla12@columbia.edu	This study evaluated the short-term impact of a school-based violence prevention  initiative on developmental processes thought to place children at risk for  future aggression and violence and examined the influence of classroom and  neighborhood contexts on the effectiveness of the violence prevention  initiative. Two waves of developmental data (fall and spring) were analyzed from  the 1st year of the evaluation of the Resolving Conflict Creatively Program  (RCCP), which includes 5053 children from grades two to six from 11 elementary  schools in New York City. Three distinct profiles of exposure to the  intervention were derived from Management Information System (MIS) data on  between classroom differences in teacher Training and Coaching in RCCP,  Classroom Instruction in RCCP, and percentages of students who are Peer  Mediators. Developmental processes that place children at risk were found to  increase over the course of the school year. Children whose teachers had a  moderate amount of training and coaching from RCCP and who taught many lessons  showed significantly slower growth in aggression-related processes, and less of  a decrease in competence-related processes, compared to children whose teachers  taught few or no lessons. Contrary to expectation, children whose teachers had a  higher level of training and coaching in the RCCP but taught few lessons showed  significantly faster growth over time in aggressive cognitions and behaviors.  The impact of the intervention on children's social cognitions (but not on their  interpersonal behaviors) varied by context. Specifically the positive effect of  High Lessons was dampened for children in high-risk classrooms and  neighborhoods. Implications for future research on developmental psychopathology  in context and for the design of preventive interventions are discussed.

Schwartz D(1), McFadyen-Ketchum SA, Dodge KA, Pettit GS, Bates JE.	Author information: (1)Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.	This study reports a short-term prospective investigation of the role of peer  group victimization in the development of children's behavior problems, at home  and in school. Sociometric interviews were utilized to assess aggression,  victimization by peers, and peer rejection, for 330 children who were in either  the third or fourth grade (approximate mean ages of 8-9 years old). Behavior  problems were assessed using standardized behavior checklists completed by  mothers and teachers. A follow-up assessment of behavior problems was completed  2 years later, when the children were in either the fifth or sixth grade  (approximate mean ages of 10-11 years old). Victimization was both concurrently  and prospectively associated with externalizing, attention dysregulation, and  immature/dependent behavior. Victimization also predicted increases in these  difficulties over time, and incremented the prediction in later behavior  problems associated with peer rejection and aggression. The results of this  investigation demonstrate that victimization in the peer group is an important  predictor of later behavioral maladjustment.

Phelps JL(1), Belsky J, Crnic K.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park  16802, USA.	Research suggests that adults who have developed a coherent perspective on their  negative, early attachment relationships (i.e., earned secures) do not reenact  poor parenting practices with their own children. However, no studies have  addressed whether earned secures maintain positive parenting under the pressures  of aversive environmental conditions. This study tested five alternative models  that predict how earned secures parent under low and high stress in comparison  to adults who had a positive upbringing (i.e., continuous secures) and adults  who have an incoherent perspective on a troubled childhood (i.e., insecures).  Only if earned secures exhibit effective caregiving under high stress, in  comparison to the other security groups, can it be assumed that they have broken  the intergenerational cycle of poor parenting. The Adult Attachment Interview  was used to classify 97 mothers as earned secure, continuous secure, and  insecure. Home observations of parenting and maternal self-reports of daily  hassles (our stress measure) were obtained when children were 27 months old.  Planned comparisons revealed that the diathesis-stress/incoherent present state  of mind model most accurately predicted parenting. Thus, under high stress, the  earned secures parented equivalently to the continuous secures and more  positively than the insecures; under low stress no group differences were  obtained. These findings indicate that in a normative sample earned secures  break the intergenerational cycle and exhibit resilient parenting even under  high stress conditions.

Author information: (1)Yale University School of Medicine, USA.	One of the central tenets of developmental psychopathology is the belief that we  can learn more about normal functioning through the study of psychopathology and  arrive at a better understanding of pathological conditions through  investigations of normal behavior. Advances in knowledge from one area will  inform us regarding mechanisms at work in the other. A similar perspective is  the driving force behind recent scientific advances in our understanding of  certain developmental disorders. In this paper, molecular findings for four  developmental disorders are reviewed: Prader-Willi syndrome, fragile X syndrome,  Williams syndrome, and lissencephaly. These disorders were chosen for discussion  because putative genes for each of them have been isolated. The ways in which  mutations within these genes disrupt normal cognitive and behavioral functioning  are discussed. Although considerable progress has been achieved in understanding  the genetic mechanisms for these illnesses, much more research is needed to  identify the environmental and genetic factors that interact to contribute to  the expression of the more complex behavioral disorders.

Post RM(1), Weiss SR.	Author information: (1)Biological Psychiatry Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, National  Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1272, USA.	Whereas the basic wiring diagram of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS)  is genetically preprogramed, its fine tuning throughout different phases of  infancy, childhood, and adulthood are highly experience dependent. The potential  neurobiological mechanisms and behavioral effects of such experience-dependent  neuroplasticity as a function of stage of development are outlined. A basic  thesis of this paper is that mechanisms involved in neuronal learning and  memory, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), are  used and reused not only in the sculpting of the CNS in the initial  establishment of connections, but also again in the molding of personality and  behavior based on experience. It is postulated that for higher order processes  such as emotional memory, such neuroplasticity is occurring at increasingly  larger numbers of synapses and cell assemblies with increasing mechanistic  complexity and self-organization. Just as overexcitation or deprivation can  profoundly affect the development of the visual system, it is postulated that  similar phenomena exist in the neural substrates of emotional and cognitive  development. In addition, a secondary and potentially more widespread series of  ramifications are likely to occur in the higher order and integrative systems,  such as secondary and tertiary cortical association areas and prefrontal cortex  that become the ultimate integrators of emotion and experience, leading to  subsequent actions and plans for the future. This process is by definition,  plastic, and such remodeling is likely to take place not only at the level of  the single synapse, but also at higher levels of network integration of which we  currently have only the barest glimpse. Nonetheless, beginning to discuss the  neurobiology of such self-organizing plastic systems may begin to change our  conceptual approaches to psychopathology and open new avenues of therapeutics  for the major psychiatric illnesses that are critically dependent on such higher  order learning and memory mechanisms.

Toth SL(1), Cicchetti D, Macfie J, Emde RN.	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, NY 14608, USA.	The MacArthur Story Stem Battery was used to examine maternal and  self-representations in neglected, physically abused, sexually abused, and  nonmaltreated comparison preschool children. The narratives of maltreated  children contained more negative maternal representations and more negative  self-representations than did the narratives of nonmaltreated children.  Maltreated children also were more controlling with and less responsive to the  examiner. In examining the differential impact of maltreatment subtype  differences on maternal and self-representations, physically abused children  evidenced the most negative maternal representations; they also had more  negative self-representations than nonmaltreated children. Sexually abused  children manifested more positive self-representations than neglected children.  Despite these differences in the nature of maternal and self-representations,  physically and sexually abused children both were more controlling and less  responsive to the examiner. The investigation adds to the corpus of knowledge  regarding disturbances in the self-system functioning of maltreated children and  provides support for relations between representational models of self and other  and the self-organizing function that these models exert on children's lives.

Beeghly M(1), Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. beeghly@a1.tch.harvard.edu	The ability to talk about the internal states (IS) of self and other is an  age-typical development of early childhood that is thought to reflect young  children's emergent self-other understanding. This study examined the emergence  of an IS lexicon in a cross-sectional sample of young children with Down  syndrome (DS) and a cognitively and demographically comparable group of normally  developing (ND) children. Children's IS lexicons were derived from transcripts  of their spontaneous utterances during two laboratory contexts: a mother-child  emotions picture book task and semistructured play. Children with DS produced  significantly fewer IS words and fewer IS word types than their MA-matched  counterparts. Controlling for corpus size, children with DS also were less  likely to attribute internal states to themselves and were more context bound in  their use of IS language. In addition, children with DS also differed from ND  children in the semantic content of their IS language, with proportionately  higher rates of affective words and lower rates for words about volition  ability, and cognition. For both the DS and ND groups, individual differences in  IS language production were significantly related to general expressive language  skills. However, dissociations were observed for the relation between children's  IS word production and nonverbal symbolic play skills in the two groups. These  findings suggest some degree of disorganization at the interface among symbolic  domains for children with DS. Because IS language is critical to the regulation  of social interaction and an early index of self-other differentiation and  understanding, children with DS may be at risk for later compromises in  self-organization.

Loveland KA(1), Tunali-Kotoski B, Chen YR, Ortegon J, Pearson DA, Brelsford KA,  Gibbs MC.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Texas Mental  Sciences Institute 77030, USA.	This study examined the roles of verbal and nonverbal sources of information in  the ability of persons with and without autism to recognize emotion. Child,  adolescent, and young adult participants in four groups [Lower Functioning  Autism (LFA) (n = 17), High Functioning Autism (HFA) (n = 18), Lower Functioning  Comparison (LFC) (n = 18), and High Functioning Comparison (HFC) (n = 23)]  identified emotions shown (happy, angry, sad, surprised, or neutral) in video  clips of individuals expressing emotion verbally, nonverbally, or both. Verbal  expressions of emotion were either Explicit, Implicit, or Neutral, whereas  nonverbal expressions were Animate or Flat (3 x 2). Pairwise ANCOVAs indicated  no group differences between HFA and HFC groups or between the LFA and LFC  groups, and indicated instead group differences between higher and lower  functioning persons. With groups collapsed into High Functioning (HF) and Lower  Functioning (LF), significant group differences were found. Performance of LF  individuals suggested they had difficulty inferring how a person felt based on  what the person said, if the emotion was not explicitly named. Performance of HF  individuals suggested they relied more on nonverbal than on verbal information  to determine a speaker's emotion, except where the emotion was explicitly named.  Results suggested that persons with autistic spectrum disorders can use  affective information from multiple sources in much the same ways as persons of  comparable developmental level without autism.

Author information: (1)University of Miami School of Medicine, FL 33101, USA.  njones@mednet.med.miami.edu	Previous research has documented differences in the pattern of EEG activation  between 3-month-old infants of depressed mothers and infants of nondepressed  mothers. In the present study, EEG was recorded in even younger 1-month-old  infants of depressed and nondepressed mothers. The infants of depressed mothers  exhibited greater relative right frontal EEG asymmetry (due to reduced left  frontal activation), and this pattern at 1 month was significantly related to  3-month EEG asymmetry. Right frontal EEG asymmetry was also related to more  frequent negative facial expressions (sad and pre-cry faces) during the  Brazelton exam. Finally, the infants of depressed mothers showed more  indeterminate sleep, were less active, and cried less than infants of  nondepressed mothers.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Stockholm University, Sweden. lrb@psychology.su.se	There is a growing acceptance of a holistic, interactionistic view in which the  individual is seen as an organized whole, functioning and developing as a  totality. This view emphasizes the importance of patterns of operating factors.  Within this framework, a standard variable-oriented approach, focusing on the  variable as the main theoretical and analytical unit, has limitations. A  person-oriented approach would often be preferable, where the main theoretical  and analytical unit is the specific pattern of operating factors. Such an  approach is presented here, focusing on individual development and  psychopathology. A brief theoretical and methodological overview is given and a  classification approach is emphasized. Empirical examples concerning the  longitudinal study of adjustment problems illustrate a number of issues believed  to be important to development and psychopathology: problem gravitation, the  significance of single variables and of patterns, the developmental study of  syndromes (= typical patterns), and the detection of "white spots" in  development.

Wakefield JC(1).	Author information: (1)Rutgers University, USA. jcw2@columbia.edu	One goal of developmental psychopathology is to understand the origins and  course of mental disorders. I argue that pursuit of this goal requires a valid  conceptual understanding of disorder and that this understanding can be provided  by the "harmful dysfunction" analysis of the concept of disorder. The harmful  dysfunction analysis holds that a disorder is a condition that is both harmful  according to social values and caused by an internal dysfunction, that is, by a  failure of an internal mechanism to perform a function for which it was  naturally selected. This analysis explains why many of the distinctive features  of developmental psychopathology are appropriate to the study of disorder. It is  argued that the harmful dysfunction analysis is a necessary supplement to other  proposed criteria for disorder, such as developmental deviation or predictive  validity.

Author information: (1)Child & Adolescent Disorder Branch, NIMH, Rockville, MD 20857, USA.  jrichter@NIH.gov	Developmental psychopathology stands poised at the close of the 20th century on  the horns of a major scientific dilemma. The essence of this dilemma lies in the  contrast between its heuristically rich open system concepts on the one hand,  and the closed system paradigm it adopted from mainstream psychology for  investigating those models on the other. Many of the research methods,  assessment strategies, and data analytic models of psychology's paradigm are  predicated on closed system assumptions and explanatory models. Thus, they are  fundamentally inadequate for studying humans, who are unparalleled among open  systems in their wide ranging capacities for equifinal and multifinal  functioning. Developmental psychopathology faces two challenges in successfully  negotiating the developmentalist's dilemma. The first lies in recognizing how  the current paradigm encourages research practices that are antithetical to  developmental principles, yet continue to flourish. I argue that the  developmentalist's dilemma is sustained by long standing, mutually enabling  weaknesses in the paradigm's discovery methods and scientific standards. These  interdependent weaknesses function like a distorted lens on the research process  by variously sustaining the illusion of theoretical progress, obscuring the need  for fundamental reforms, and both constraining and misguiding reform efforts. An  understanding of how these influences arise and take their toll provides a  foundation and rationale for engaging the second challenge. The essence of this  challenge will be finding ways to resolve the developmentalist's dilemma outside  the constraints of the existing paradigm by developing indigenous research  strategies, methods, and standards with fidelity to the complexity of  developmental phenomena.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of Vermont, Burlington 05401, USA.	Accelerated longitudinal analyses revealed both similarities and differences  between the developmental trajectories of empirically based aggressive versus  delinquent syndromes in childhood and adolescence. Syndromes were scored from  standardized ratings obtained from parents five times at 2-year intervals for  seven birth cohorts of Dutch children initially assessed at ages 4 to 10 years.  Scores for both the aggressive and delinquent syndromes declined from ages 4 to  10. After about age 10 years, scores for the aggressive syndrome continued to  decline, but scores for the delinquent syndrome increased until about age 17.  The aggressive syndrome was significantly more stable than the delinquent  syndrome. Long-term predictive correlations between matched subjects from  different cohorts were as high as predictive correlations between scores  obtained by the same subjects, thus supporting the validity of accelerated  longitudinal analyses. The results highlight important developmental  distinctions between aggressive versus delinquent conduct problems. Failure to  distinguish between aggressive and delinquent conduct problems could generate  misleading conclusions about their respective developmental courses and limit  the generalizability of results.

Rejection sensitivity as a mediator of the impact of childhood exposure to  family violence on adult attachment behavior.	Feldman S(1), Downey G.	Author information: (1)Columbia University.	Substantial evidence indicates a link between exposure to family violence in  childhood and troubled social relationships. We draw on attachment and  social-cognitive theory to formulate a model of the mechanisms underlying this  association. The model proposes that early experiences of overt rejection (e.g.,  physical maltreatment) or covert rejection (e.g., emotional neglect) are  internalized as sensitivity to rejection. In this study, we operationalize  sensitivity to rejection in social-cognitive terms as a tendency to expect and  be concerned about rejection across a range of social situations. We hypothesize  that rejection sensitivity mediates the link between exposure to family violence  and adult attachment behavior. Data from a survey of 212 undergraduates support  this hypothesis and also provide evidence that indicates sensitivity to  rejection underlies both avoidant and ambivalent patterns of insecure adult  attachment behavior. Overall, the results illustrate the power of a process  approach to explaining the developmental sequelae of maltreatment.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579400005976 PMID: 23438329

Despite considerable efforts to understand the processes that underlie the  development of externalizing behavior problems, it is still unclear why  externalizing problems remain chronically high for some children, emerge early  and cease by late childhood for others, and arise in adolescence in some cases.  The purpose of this study was to examine how a wide range of child and family  risk factors are linked to trajectories of externalizing behavior and how these  relationships vary from infancy to middle adolescence. We used data from the  community-based Norwegian Tracking Opportunities and Problems (TOPP) study  sample (n = 921). A Cholesky factorization model was specified to separate  stable and emerging risk doses across four developmental periods (infancy, early  and middle childhood, and middle adolescence). Children in the High Stable class  were characterized by substantially elevated risk levels in multiple domains  throughout the study period. Children in the High Childhood Limited class had  very high levels of temperamental emotionality, internalizing symptoms, and  maternal mental distress, suggesting a substantial intrinsic emotional basis for  their externalizing problems. Intrinsic factors seemed less salient for the  Adolescent Onset class. These findings emphasize the need for a dynamic  perspective on risk factors and support the importance of prevention and  intervention efforts across multiple domains from early childhood and throughout  adolescence.

Given the equivocal literature on the relationship between internalizing  symptoms and early adolescent alcohol use (AU) and AU disorder (AUD), the  present study took a developmental perspective to understand how internalizing  and externalizing symptoms may operate together in the etiology of AU and AUD.  We pit the delayed onset and rapid escalation hypothesis (Hussong et al., 2011)  against a synthesis of the dual failure model and the stable co-occurring  hypothesis (Capaldi, 1992; Colder et al., 2013, 2018) to test competing  developmental pathways to adolescent AU and AUD involving problem behavior, peer  delinquency, and early initiation of AU. A latent transactional and mediational  framework was used to test pathways to AUD spanning developmental periods before  AU initiation (Mage = 11) to early and high risk for AUD (Mage = 14-15 and Mage  = 17-18). The results supported three pathways to AUD. The first started with  "pure" externalizing symptoms in early childhood and involved multiple  mediators, including the subsequent development of co-occurring symptoms and  peer delinquency. The second pathway involved stable co-occurring symptoms.  Interestingly, chronically elevated pure internalizing symptoms did not figure  prominently in pathways to AUD. Selection and socialization effects between  early AU and peer delinquency constituted a third pathway.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001512 PMID: 32308172

The current study used daily assessments of sleep to examine stability and  change in sleep chronotype in adolescents and their parents. The study assessed  adolescent sleep chronotype according to age, gender, and parent chronotype, and  evaluated its associations with emotional and behavioral problems in youth.  Participants included of 417 Mexican American adolescents (Mage = 16.0 years,  Range = 13.9-20.0) and 403 caregivers, who reported bed and wake times daily for  2 consecutive weeks at two time points spaced 1 year apart. In addition,  adolescents completed established self-report questionnaires of emotional and  behavioral problems. Chronotype was computed as the midsleep point from bed to  wake time on free days, correcting for sleep debt accumulated across scheduled  days. Multilevel modeling showed a curvilinear association between adolescent  age and chronotype, with a peak eveningness observed between ages 16 to 17.  Adolescent and parent chronotypes were contemporaneously correlated, but each  was only moderately stable over the 1-year period. Later adolescent chronotype  was contemporaneously associated with more substance use in all adolescents.  Individual development and the family context shape sleep chronotype in  adolescents and parents. Sleep chronotype is implicated in adolescent behavioral  health.

(2)Centre for Adolescent Health, Murdoch Children's Research Institute,  Parkville, Australia. (3)La Trobe University, Bundoora, Australia.	Attachment disorganization in early childhood is an influential yet modifiable  risk factor for later mental health problems. Beyond established transmission  through parents' unresolved attachment representations and caregiving  sensitivity, little replicated evidence exists for wider determinants of  offspring attachment disorganization. This study examined the replicated  evidence for psychosocial risk factors in the preconception, prenatal, and  postnatal periods. We identified all relevant longitudinal studies, and examined  all risk relationships for which evidence existed in two or more cohorts (48  effects, 17 studies, N = 6,099). Study-specific and pooled risk associations  were estimated and a range of moderators evaluated. Mothers' low socioeconomic  status (r = .28, k = 2), perinatal loss of a child (r = .26, k = 2), caregiving  intrusiveness (r = .31, k = 2), and infant male sex (r = .26, k = 4) predicted  offspring attachment disorganization. Maternal sensitivity (r = -.25, k = 6) and  higher metacognition during pregnancy (r = -.23, k = 3) predicted lower risk of  offspring attachment disorganization. Findings suggest the origins of offspring  disorganized attachment include but extend beyond maternal unresolved attachment  representations and caregiving. We discuss implications for theory and for  identification of modifiable risk pathways in the perinatal window.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941900172X PMID: 32299518

(2)Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden. (3)Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics and Department of  Psychiatry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.	We investigate how early exposure to parental externalizing behaviors (EB) may  contribute to development of alcohol use disorders (AUD) in young adulthood,  testing a developmental cascade model focused on competencies in three domains  (academic, conduct, and work) in adolescence and emerging adulthood, and  examining whether high parental education can buffer negative effects of  parental EB and other early risk factors. We use data from 451,054 Swedish-born  men included in the national conscript register. Structural equation models  showed parental EB was associated with academic and behavioral problems during  adolescence, as well as with lower resilience, more criminal behavior, and  reduced social integration during emerging adulthood. These pathways led to  elevated rates of AUD in emerging and young adulthood. Multiple groups analysis  showed most of the indirect pathways from parental EB to AUD were present but  buffered by higher parental education, suggesting early life experiences and  competencies matter more for young men from lower socioeconomic status (SES)  families than from higher SES families. Developmental competencies in school,  conduct, and work are important precursors to the development of AUD by young  adulthood that are predicted by parental EB. Occupational success may be an  overlooked source of resilience for young men from low-SES families.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001640 PMID: 32124710

The present study examined empathy deficits in toddlerhood (age 14 to 36 months)  as predictors of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) symptoms and psychopathy  measured by the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy scale (Levenson, Kiehl, &  Fitzpatrick, 1995) in adulthood (age 23 years) in 956 individuals from the  Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study. Consistent with the hypothesis that antisocial  behavior is associated with "active" rather than "passive" empathy deficits,  early disregard for others, not lack of concern for others, predicted later ASPD  symptoms. Early disregard for others was also significantly associated with  factor 1 of the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale, which includes items  assessing interpersonal and affective deficits, but not with factor 2, which  includes items assessing impulsivity and poor behavioral control. The  association between early disregard for others and psychopathy factor 2 was near  zero after controlling for the shared variance between psychopathy factors 1 and  2. These results suggest that there is a propensity toward adulthood ASPD  symptoms and psychopathy factor 1 that can be assessed early in development,  which may help identify individuals most at risk for stable antisocial outcomes.

Aggression coincides with emotional underarousal in childhood, but we still lack  an understanding of how underarousal contributes to aggression. With an  ethnically diverse sample of 8-year-olds (N = 150), we tested whether  physiological underarousal and lower fear recognition were indirectly associated  with heightened aggression through dampened guilt feelings. Caregivers rated  children's aggressive behavior. We assessed children's skin conductance (SC) and  respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) while they imagined transgressing norms and  measured their fear recognition with a facial morph task. Children reported  guilt or lack thereof after hypothetically transgressing. The interaction of  decreasing SC and increasing RSA (i.e., physiological underarousal) and poor  fear recognition were indirectly associated with higher aggression through their  associations with lower guilt. Emotional underarousal may contribute to  aggression by disrupting the normative development of guilt. We discuss  strategies to improve social-emotional acuity and reduce aggression in children  with blunted physiological arousal and fear recognition.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001627 PMID: 32103788

The way that people internalize adverse experiences plays an important role in  the development of psychopathology. The Pathogenic Belief Scale (PBS) is  intended to operationalize a transtheoretical understanding of repetitive  patterns of emotion-laden beliefs that develop in childhood and continue to  influence people's current experience. Using a cross-sectional survey design, we  recruited a large heterogeneous sample of 246 clinic outpatients and 732 adults  in the community. Besides the PBS, measures of adverse parenting experiences and  common psychopathology were administered. An exploratory factor analysis of the  total sample of 978 participants was conducted followed by a convergent validity  analysis for the 246 clinic outpatients. The three-factor solution included  "cannot rely on others," "undeserving," and "interpersonal guilt," and it showed  good psychometric properties, including convergent validity with the measures of  adverse parenting experiences and psychopathology. The 34-item PBS offers a  promising self-report measure that could help delineate and understand the  pathogenic beliefs that heterogeneous samples of patients may hold. Pathogenic  beliefs may be relevant to the psychotherapy process, regardless of model or  theoretical context.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001615 PMID: 32091353

Examining income dynamics and externalizing and internalizing trajectories  through a developmental psychopathology lens: A nationally representative study.

(2)Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.	Prior research has documented elevations in levels of internalizing and  externalizing behaviors among children in lower income families in comparison to  more advantaged peers. However, most studies focus on behavior problems at a  single point in time or within a short developmental period. Associations  between income dynamics and developmental trajectories of behavior problems over  time are less understood. To address this, the current study uses data from the  National Longitudinal Study of Youth (N = 7,476; 50.8% male) to examine how  income dynamics (annual income and income volatility) across three distinct  developmental periods from early childhood to early adolescence relate to  trajectories of externalizing and internalizing problems. Group-based mixture  modeling revealed a five-group trajectory model for externalizing behavior and a  four-group trajectory model for internalizing behavior. Higher cumulative annual  income predicted greater likelihood of belonging to the low-stable group  compared to the other, more problematic groups for both externalizing and  internalizing trajectories. In addition, income losses predicted higher risk of  membership in any group other than the low-stable group for internalizing and  externalizing behavior. Developmental period-specific income dynamics, though  not as consistent as cumulative dynamics, also predicted trajectory group  membership.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001494 PMID: 32091352

Multiproblem young adults present with major problems across key life domains,  but empirical studies investigating the nature of multiproblem behavior in  accordance to ecobiodevelopmental theory are scarce. To address this gap, we  performed a cluster analysis on indicators spanning the key life domains  addiction, mental health, social network, and justice. In a large sample (N =  680) of multiproblem young adults, we identified five subgroups labeled "severe  with alcohol and cannabis problems" (4.3%), "severe with cannabis problems"  (25.6%), "severe without alcohol or drug problems" (33.2%), "moderate with  mental health problems" (22.9%), and "moderate without mental health problems"  (14.0%). There were large differences between the severe and moderate groups in  terms of childhood risk factors such as emotional and physical abuse, concerning  baseline functioning such as comorbid disorders and aggressive behavior, and in  the outcome measure of violent offending. Our findings indicate that  multiproblem young adult behavior clusters within profiles that differ according  to the severity and nature of problems. Investing in screening for clustered  problems may be beneficial for early problem differentiation and selection of  appropriate intervention before and during treatment programs.

"Joint action"-the ability to coordinate actions with others-is critical for  achieving individual and interpersonal goals and for our collective success as a  species. Joint actions require accurate and rapid inferences about others'  goals, intentions, and focus of attention, skills that are thought to be  impaired in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Research to date  has not investigated joint action abilities in individuals with ASD during  real-world social interactions. We conducted an experimental study that required  children with ASD and typically developing children to move tables by themselves  or collaboratively through a maze. This involved developing innovative  methodologies for measuring action coordination-a critical component of the  joint action process. We found that children with ASD are less likely to benefit  from the collaboration of a peer than are typically developing children, and  they are less likely to synchronize their steps when moving the table. However,  these differences were masked when scaffolded by an adult. There was no evidence  that ASD differences were due to gross motor delays in the participants with  ASD. We argue that action coordination is a highly adaptive social process that  is intrinsic to successful human functioning that manifests as atypical  synchronization of mind and body in children with ASD.

Removal from institutional care and placement into  families can promote recovery. However, little is known about how positive  outcomes are sustained across adolescence among children with histories of  severe deprivation. The present study examined the caregiving conditions that  are associated with attaining and maintaining competent functioning (i.e.,  outcomes within typical levels) from middle childhood to adolescence following  exposure to early institutional care. The participants included children with  and without a history of institutional care who had competence assessed at ages  8, 12, and 16 years across seven domains: family relationships, peer  relationships, academic performance, physical health, mental health, substance  use (ages 12 and 16 years only), and risk-taking behavior. The participants were  grouped based on whether they were always versus not always competent and never  versus ever competent at ages 8 through 16 years. Adolescents with a history of  institutional care were less likely to be consistently competent than those who  were family reared. Among those who were exposed to early institutional rearing,  maintaining competent functioning from 8 to 16 years was associated with  spending less time in institutions and receiving higher-quality caregiving early  in life. Ensuring high quality early caregiving may promote competent  functioning following early deprivation.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001500 PMCID: PMC7332404 PMID: 31896375

(2)Department of Psychiatry and Child Trauma Research Program,University of  California,San Francisco. (3)Children's Research and Education Institute,New York City.	This replication study examined protective effects of positive childhood  memories with caregivers ("angels in the nursery") against lifespan and  intergenerational transmission of trauma. More positive, elaborated angel  memories were hypothesized to buffer associations between mothers' childhood  maltreatment and their adulthood posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and  depression symptoms, comorbid psychopathology, and children's trauma exposure.  Participants were 185 mothers (M age = 30.67 years, SD = 6.44, range = 17-46  years, 54.6% Latina, 17.8% White, 10.3% African American, 17.3% other; 24%  Spanish speaking) and children (M age = 42.51 months; SD = 15.95, range = 3-72  months; 51.4% male). Mothers completed the Angels in the Nursery Interview (Van  Horn, Lieberman, &amp; Harris, 2008), and assessments of childhood maltreatment,  adulthood psychopathology, children's trauma exposure, and demographics. Angel  memories significantly moderated associations between maltreatment and PTSD (but  not depression) symptoms, comorbid psychopathology, and children's trauma  exposure. For mothers with less positive, elaborated angel memories, higher  levels of maltreatment predicted higher levels of psychopathology and children's  trauma exposure. For mothers with more positive, elaborated memories, however,  predictive associations were not significant, reflecting protective effects.  Furthermore, protective effects against children's trauma exposure were  significant only for female children, suggesting that angel memories may  specifically buffer against intergenerational trauma from mothers to daughters.

This study investigated the longitudinal associations among prenatal substance  use, socioeconomic adversity, parenting (maternal warmth, sensitivity, and  harshness), children's self-regulation (internalization of rules and  conscience), and conduct problems from infancy to middle childhood (Grade 2).  Three competing conceptual models including cascade (indirect or mediated),  additive (cumulative), and transactional (bidirectional) effects were tested and  compared. The sample consisted of 216 low-income families (primary caretaker and  children; 51% girls; 74% African American). Using a repeated-measures,  multimethod, multi-informant design, a series of full panel models were  specified. Findings primarily supported a developmental cascade model, and there  was some support for additive effects. More specifically, maternal prenatal  substance use and socioeconomic adversity in infancy were prospectively  associated with lower levels of maternal sensitivity. Subsequently, lower  maternal sensitivity was associated with decreases in children's conscience in  early childhood, and in turn, lower conscience predicted increases in  teacher-reported conduct problems in middle childhood. There was also a second  pathway from sustained maternal depression (in infancy and toddlerhood) to early  childhood conduct problems. These findings demonstrated how processes of risk  and resilience collectively contributed to children's early onset conduct  problems.

(3)University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.	Violence exposure during childhood is common and associated with poor cognitive  and academic functioning. However, little is known about how violence exposure  influences cognitive processes that might contribute to these disparities, such  as working memory, or their neural underpinnings, particularly for cognitive  processes that occur in emotionally salient contexts. We address this gap in a  sample of 54 participants aged 8 to 19 years (50% female), half with exposure to  interpersonal violence. Participants completed a delayed match to sample task  for emotional faces while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging  scanning. Violence-exposed youth performed worse than controls on happy and  neutral, but not angry, trials. In whole-brain analysis, violence-exposed youth  had reduced activation in the left middle frontal gyrus and right intraparietal  sulcus during encoding and the left superior temporal sulcus and  temporal-parietal junction during retrieval compared to control youth. Reduced  activation in the left middle frontal gyrus during encoding and the left  superior temporal sulcus during retrieval mediated the association between  violence exposure and task performance. Violence exposure influences the  frontoparietal network that supports working memory as well as regions involved  in facial processing during working memory for emotional stimuli. Reduced neural  recruitment in these regions may explain atypical patterns of cognitive  processing seen among violence-exposed youth, particularly within emotional  contexts.

Eggum ND(1), Eisenberg N, Spinrad TL, Valiente C, Edwards A, Kupfer AS, Reiser  M.	Author information: (1)Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-1104, USA.	Relations of avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) with shyness and inhibition  suggest that a precursor of AvPD is withdrawal. Using a sample of 4.5- to  7-year-olds studied four times, 2 years apart, four and three classes of  children differing in trajectories of mother- and teacher-reported withdrawal,  respectively, were identified. Mothers and teachers generally did not agree on  children's trajectories but the pattern of findings in the two contexts did not  differ markedly. The mother-identified high and declining withdrawal class, in  comparison with less withdrawn classes, and the teacher-identified high and  declining class compared with low withdrawal classes, were associated with  relatively high levels of anger and low levels of attentional control and  resiliency. The mother-identified moderate and increasing withdrawal class was  distinguished from less problematic withdrawal classes by higher anger, lower  resiliency, and sometimes, lower attentional control. The teacher-identified low  and increasing withdrawal class was distinguished from less problematic  withdrawal classes by lower resiliency and lower attentional control. Findings  are discussed in terms of the developmental precursors to social withdrawal and  avoidant behavior.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409000443 PMCID: PMC2774890 PMID: 19583885 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Published data were reviewed that  support the hypothesis that the psychobiological sequelae of child maltreatment  may be regarded as an environmentally induced complex developmental disorder.  Data to support this view, including the descriptions of both psychobiological  and brain maturation studies in maltreatment research, emphasizing the  similarities and differences between children, adolescents, and adults, were  reviewed. Many suggestions for important future psychobiological and brain  maturation research investigations as well as public policy ideas were offered.

Children of parents with a history of depression: The impact of a preventive  intervention on youth social problems through reductions in internalizing  problems.	Breslend NL(1), Parent J(2), Forehand R(1), Peisch V(1), Compas BE(3).	Author information: (1)University of Vermont. (2)Florida International University. (3)Vanderbilt University.	The current investigation examined if changes in youth internalizing problems as  a result of a family group cognitive behavioral (FGCB) preventive intervention  for families with a parent with a history of depression had a cascade effect on  youth social problems over 24 months and the bidirectional nature of these  effects. One hundred eighty families with a parent with a history of major  depressive disorder (M age = 41.96; 88.9% mothers) and a youth age 9 to 15 years  (49.4% females; M age = 11.46) participated. Findings from a panel model  indicated that, compared to a minimum intervention condition, the FGCB  intervention significantly reduced youth internalizing problems at 12 months  that in turn were associated with lower levels of social problems at 18 months.  Similarly, the FGCB intervention reduced internalizing problems at 18 months,  which were associated with fewer social problems at 24 months. Changes in social  problems were not related to reductions in subsequent internalizing problems.  The findings suggest that reductions in youth internalizing problems can lead to  lower levels of social problems. Youth social problems are difficult to change;  therefore, targeting internalizing problems may be an effective way to reduce  the social problems of children of parents with a history of depression.

Childhood adversity moderates the influence of proximal episodic stress on the  cortisol awakening response and depressive symptoms in adolescents.

(4)University of Delaware.	Childhood adversity (CA) is known to predict sensitization to proximal  stressors. Researchers have suggested that disruptions in  hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning may be a biological mechanism.  If so, CA may predict altered associations between proximal life stress and  markers of cortisol secretion. We examined whether CA moderates associations  between recent episodic stress and (a) the cortisol awakening response (CAR),  and (b) depressive symptoms, in 241 adolescents aged 14-17 years (cortisol n =  196). Salivary cortisol was sampled at 0, 30, and 60 min postawakening for 2  days. The CAR was calculated as the area under the curve with respect to  increase and waking cortisol. CA and episodic stress were assessed using  contextual-threat-method-coded objective interviews. CA significantly interacted  with episodic stress to predict both the CAR and depression. Among those with  low CA, episodic stress predicted increased CAR but did not predict depression.  For adolescents with high CA, episodic stress predicted lower CAR and higher  depression. These interactions were found only for independent (uncontrollable,  fateful) events, and not for dependent (self-generated) stress. Increased  allostatic load resulting from CA exposure may interfere with adolescents'  ability to optimally regulate their CAR in relation to recent stress,  contributing to increased depression risk.

The association between early life stress and prefrontal cortex activation  during implicit emotion regulation is moderated by sex in early adolescence.	Colich NL(1), Williams ES(1), Ho TC(1), King LS(1), Humphreys KL(1), Price  AN(1), Ordaz SJ(1), Gotlib IH(1).	Author information: (1)Stanford University.	Early life stress (ELS) is a significant risk factor for the emergence of  internalizing problems in adolescence. Beginning in adolescence, females are  twice as likely as males to experience internalizing disorders. The present  study was designed to examine sex differences in the association between ELS and  internalizing problems in early pubertal adolescents, and whether and how  corticolimbic function and connectivity may underlie these associations.  Fifty-nine early pubertal males and 78 early pubertal females, ages 9-13 years  (all Tanner Stage 3 or below) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging as  they performed an emotion label task that robustly interrogates corticolimbic  function. Participants were also interviewed about their experience of ELS.  Females exhibited a positive association between ELS and internalizing problems,  whereas males exhibited no such association. Whole-brain and amygdala region of  interest analyses indicated that whereas females exhibited a positive  association between ELS and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during implicit  emotion regulation, males showed no such association. Activation in these  regions was positively associated with internalizing problems in females but not  males; however, activation in these regions did not mediate the association  between ELS and internalizing problems. Finally, both boys and girls exhibited  an association between ELS and increased negative connectivity between the right  ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral amygdala. Using a carefully  characterized sample of early pubertal adolescents, the current study highlights  important sex differences in the development of corticolimbic circuitry during a  critical period of brain development. These sex differences may play a  significant role in subsequent risk for internalizing problems.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417001444 PMCID: PMC5726300 PMID: 29162186 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Adolescent psychotic experiences increase risk for schizophrenia and other  severe psychopathology in adulthood. Converging evidence implicates urban and  adverse neighborhood conditions in the etiology of adolescent psychotic  experiences, but the role of young people's personal perceptions of disorder  (i.e., physical and social signs of threat) in their neighborhood is unknown.  This was examined using data from the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin  Study, a nationally representative birth cohort of 2,232 British twins.  Participants were interviewed at age 18 about psychotic phenomena and  perceptions of disorder in the neighborhood. Multilevel, longitudinal, and  genetically sensitive analyses investigated the association between perceptions  of neighborhood disorder and adolescent psychotic experiences. Adolescents who  perceived higher levels of neighborhood disorder were significantly more likely  to have psychotic experiences, even after accounting for  objectively/independently measured levels of crime and disorder, neighborhood-  and family-level socioeconomic status, family psychiatric history, adolescent  substance and mood problems, and childhood psychotic symptoms: odds ratio =  1.62, 95% confidence interval [1.27, 2.05], p < .001. The phenotypic overlap  between adolescent psychotic experiences and perceptions of neighborhood  disorder was explained by overlapping common environmental influences, rC = .88,  95% confidence interval [0.26, 1.00]. Findings suggest that early psychological  interventions to prevent adolescent psychotic experiences should explore the  role of young people's (potentially modifiable) perceptions of threatening  neighborhood conditions.

Roubinov DS(1), Hagan MJ(1), Boyce WT(1), Essex MJ(2), Bush NR(1).	Author information: (1)University of California,San Francisco. (2)University of Wisconsin,Madison.	Entry into kindergarten is a developmental milestone that children may  differentially experience as stressful, with implications for variability in  neurobiological functioning. Guided by the goodness-of-fit framework, this study  tested the hypothesis that kindergarten children's (N = 338) daily cortisol  would be affected by the "match" or "mismatch" between children's temperament  and qualities of the classroom relational context. The robustness of these  associations was also explored among a separate sample of children in third  grade (N = 165). Results among kindergarten children showed negative affectivity  and overcontrolled temperament were positively related to cortisol expression  within classrooms characterized by lower levels of teacher motivational support,  but there was no relation between temperament and cortisol when motivational  support was higher. Among third-grade children, negative affectivity was  marginally positively related to cortisol at lower levels of teacher-child  closeness and unrelated at higher levels of teacher-child closeness. Findings  suggest children's cortisol expression depends on the extent to which specific  temperamental characteristics "fit" within the relational and contextual  qualities of the classroom environment, particularly as children navigate the  new roles and relationships that emerge during the transition to formal  schooling. Developmentally informed neurobiological research in classrooms may  contribute to tailored programmatic efforts to support children's school  adjustment.

(3)University of Bristol.	Emerging research in epigenetics has shown that there is variability in how  environmental exposures "get under the skin" through mechanisms like DNA  methylation to influence gene expression that may lead to differential  adaptations to stress. This is the first study to examine prospectively the  relationship between DNA methylation at birth and resilience to prenatal  environmental stressors in several domains (conduct, hyperactivity, emotional  problems, and global symptomatology) in middle childhood. We focused on DNA  methylation in the vicinity of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene as it has been  previously associated with impairments in social-cognitive processes that may  underlie a wide range of childhood psychopathology. Participants were 91 youth  exposed to pre- and postnatal adversity with established conduct problem  trajectories drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.  Consistent with our hypothesis, OXTR DNA methylation was predictive of  resilience in the conduct problems domain in middle childhood. DNA methylation  profiles did not predict resilience in domains of emotional, hyperactivity, and  global symptomatology, suggesting a potential role for OXTR in the development  of conduct problems in particular. However, individuals who were resilient to  conduct problems were also broadly resilient across multiple domains. Therefore,  future research should elucidate the biological pathways between OXTR DNA  methylation and gene expression and its relation to impairments in social  behavior.

A neurocomputational investigation of reinforcement-based decision making as a  candidate latent vulnerability mechanism in maltreated children.

(2)Boys Town National Research Hospital.	Alterations in reinforcement-based decision making may be associated with  increased psychiatric vulnerability in children who have experienced  maltreatment. A probabilistic passive avoidance task and a model-based  functional magnetic resonance imaging analytic approach were implemented to  assess the neurocomputational components underlying decision making: (a)  reinforcement expectancies (the representation of the outcomes associated with a  stimulus) and (b) prediction error signaling (the ability to detect the  differences between expected and actual outcomes). There were three main  findings. First, the maltreated group (n = 18; mean age = 13), relative to  nonmaltreated peers (n = 19; mean age = 13), showed decreased activity during  expected value processing in a widespread network commonly associated with  reinforcement expectancies representation, including the striatum (especially  the caudate), the orbitofrontal cortex, and medial temporal structures including  the hippocampus and insula. Second, consistent with previously reported  hyperresponsiveness to negative cues in the context of childhood abuse, the  maltreated group showed increased prediction error signaling in the middle  cingulate gyrus, somatosensory cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and thalamus.  Third, the maltreated group showed increased activity in frontodorsal regions  and in the putamen during expected value representation. These findings suggest  that early adverse environments disrupt the development of decision-making  processes, which in turn may compromise psychosocial functioning in ways that  increase latent vulnerability to psychiatric disorder.

Using data from 1,177 families in eight countries (Colombia, Italy, Jordan,  Kenya, the Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States), we tested a  conceptual model of direct effects of childhood family adversity on subsequent  externalizing behaviors as well as indirect effects through psychological  mediators. When children were 9 years old, mothers and fathers reported on  financial difficulties and their use of corporal punishment, and children  reported perceptions of their parents' rejection. When children were 10 years  old, they completed a computerized battery of tasks assessing reward sensitivity  and impulse control and responded to questions about hypothetical social  provocations to assess their hostile attributions and proclivity for aggressive  responding. When children were 12 years old, they reported on their  externalizing behavior. Multigroup structural equation models revealed that  across all eight countries, childhood family adversity had direct effects on  externalizing behaviors 3 years later, and childhood family adversity had  indirect effects on externalizing behavior through psychological mediators. The  findings suggest ways in which family-level adversity poses risk for children's  subsequent development of problems at psychological and behavioral levels,  situated within diverse cultural contexts.

Shaping long-term primate development: Telomere length trajectory as an  indicator of early maternal maltreatment and predictor of future physiologic  regulation.

(3)Emory University. (4)University of Massachusetts.	The molecular, neurobiological, and physical health impacts of child  maltreatment are well established, yet mechanistic pathways remain inadequately  defined. Telomere length (TL) decline is an emerging molecular indicator of  stress exposure with definitive links to negative health outcomes in maltreated  individuals. The multiple confounders endemic to human maltreatment research  impede the identification of causal pathways. This study leverages a unique  randomized, cross-foster, study design in a naturalistic translational nonhuman  primate model of infant maltreatment. At birth, newborn macaques were randomly  assigned to either a maltreating or a competent control mother, balancing for  sex, biological mother parenting history, and social rank. Offspring TL was  measured longitudinally across the first 6 months of life (infancy) from  peripheral blood. Hair cortisol accumulation was also determined at 6, 12, and  18 months of age. TL decline was greater in animals randomized to maltreatment,  but also interacted with biological mother group. Shorter TL at 6 months was  associated with higher mean cortisol levels through 18 months (juvenile period)  when controlling for relevant covariates. These results suggest that even under  the equivalent social, nutritional, and environmental conditions feasible in  naturalistic translational nonhuman primate models, early adverse caregiving  results in lasting molecular scars that foreshadow elevated health risk and  physiologic dysregulation.

Peer effects on self-regulation in adolescence depend on the nature and quality  of the peer interaction.	King KM(1), McLaughlin KA(1), Silk J(2), Monahan KC(2).	Author information: (1)University of Washington. (2)University of Pittsburgh.	Adolescence is a critical period for the development of self-regulation, and  peer interactions are thought to strongly influence regulation ability. Simple  exposure to peers has been found to alter decisions about risky behaviors and  increase sensitivity to rewards. The link between peer exposure and  self-regulation is likely to vary as a function of the type and quality of peer  interaction (e.g., rejection or acceptance). Little is known about how the  nature of interactions with peers influences different dimensions of  self-regulation. We examined how randomization to acceptance or rejection by  online "virtual" peers influenced multiple dimensions of self-regulation in a  multisite community sample of 273 adolescents aged 16-17 years. Compared to a  neutral condition, exposure to peers produced increases in cold cognitive  control, but decreased hot cognitive control. Relative to peer acceptance, peer  rejection reduced distress tolerance and increased sensitivity to losses. These  findings suggest that different dimensions of adolescent self-regulation are  influenced by the nature of the peer context: basic cognitive functions are  altered by mere exposure to peers, whereas more complex decision making and  emotion regulation processes are influenced primarily by the quality of that  exposure.

It is also far from settled on the origins and implications of  individual differences in dysregulation. This study tested several operational  definitions of dysregulation using Achenbach attention, anxious/depressed, and  aggression subscales. Individual growth curves of dysregulation were computed,  and predictors of growth differences were considered. The study also compared  the predictive utility of the dysregulation indexes to standard externalizing  and internalizing indexes. Dysregulation was indexed annually for 24 years in a  community sample (n = 585). Hierarchical linear models considered changes in  dysregulation in relation to possible influences from parenting, family stress,  child temperament, language, and peer relations. In a test of the meaning of  dysregulation, it was related to functional and psychiatric outcomes in  adulthood. Dysregulation predictions were further compared to those of the more  standard internalizing and externalizing indexes. Growth curve analyses showed  strong stability of dysregulation. Initial levels of dysregulation were  predicted by temperamental resistance to control, and change in dysregulation  was predicted by poor language ability and peer relations. Dysregulation and  externalizing problems were associated with negative adult outcomes to a similar  extent.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417001572 PMCID: PMC6460462 PMID: 29151386 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Physiological attunement in mother-infant dyads at clinical high risk: The  influence of maternal depression and positive parenting.	Hendrix CL(1), Stowe ZN(2), Newport DJ(3), Brennan PA(1).	Author information: (1)Emory University. (2)University of Wisconsin. (3)University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.	A growing number of research studies have examined the intradyadic coregulation  (or attunement) of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning in mothers  and their children. However, it is unclear how early this coregulation may be  present in dyads at clinical high risk and whether certain factors, such as  maternal depression or positive parenting, are associated with the strength of  this coregulation. The present study examined cortisol attunement within  mother-infant dyads in a high-risk sample of 233 mothers who received treatment  for psychiatric illness during pregnancy and whose infants were 6 months old at  the study visit. Results showed that maternal and infant cortisol covaried  across four time points that included a stressor paradigm and a mother-infant  interaction task. Greater maternal positive affect, but not depression,  predicted stronger cortisol attunement. In addition, infants' cortisol level  following separation from the mother predicted mothers' cortisol level at the  next time point. Mothers' cortisol level following the separation and the  laboratory stress paradigm predicted infants' cortisol levels at each successive  time point, over and above infants' own cortisol at the previous time point.  These findings suggest that maternal and infant cortisol levels influence one  another in a bidirectional fashion that may be temporally and context dependent.

Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2018 May;30(2):715-716.	In this prospective study of upper middle class youth, we document frequency of  alcohol and drug use, as well as diagnoses of abuse and dependence, during early  adulthood. Two cohorts were assessed as high school seniors and then annually  across 4 college years (New England Study of Suburban Youth younger cohort  [NESSY-Y]), and across ages 23-27 (NESSY older cohort [NESSY-O]; ns = 152 and  183 at final assessments, respectively). Across gender and annual assessments,  results showed substantial elevations, relative to norms, for frequency of  drunkenness and using marijuana, stimulants, and cocaine. Of more concern were  psychiatric diagnoses of alcohol/drug dependence: among women and men,  respectively, lifetime rates ranged between 19%-24% and 23%-40% among NESSY-Os  at age 26; and 11%-16% and 19%-27% among NESSY-Ys at 22. Relative to norms,  these rates among NESSY-O women and men were three and two times as high,  respectively, and among NESSY-Y, close to one among women but twice as high  among men. Findings also showed the protective power of parents' containment  (anticipated stringency of repercussions for substance use) at age 18; this was  inversely associated with frequency of drunkenness and marijuana and stimulant  use in adulthood. Results emphasize the need to take seriously the elevated  rates of substance documented among adolescents in affluent American school  communities.

Family environments and leukocyte transcriptome indicators of a proinflammatory  phenotype in children and parents.	Robles TF(1), Repetti RL(1), Reynolds BM(2), Chung PJ(1), Arevalo JMG(1), Cole  SW(1).	Author information: (1)University of California,Los Angeles. (2)University of Rochester Medical Center.	High conflict and low warmth in families may contribute to immune cells  developing a tendency to respond to threats with exaggerated inflammation that  is insensitive to inhibitory signaling. We tested associations between family  environments and expression of genes bearing response elements for transcription  factors that regulate inflammation: nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and  glucocorticoid receptor. The overall sample (47 families) completed interviews,  questionnaires, and 8-week daily diary assessments of conflict and warmth, which  were used to create composite family conflict and warmth scores. The diaries  assessed upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms, and URI episodes were  clinically verified. Leukocyte RNA was extracted from whole blood samples  provided by a subsample of 42 children (8-13 years of age) and 73 parents. In  children, higher conflict and lower warmth were related to greater expression of  genes bearing response elements for the proinflammatory transcription factor  NF-κB, and more severe URI symptoms. In parents, higher conflict and lower  warmth were also related to greater NF-κB-associated gene expression. Monocytes  and dendritic cells were implicated as primary cellular sources of differential  gene expression in the sample. Consistent with existing conceptual frameworks,  stressful family environments were related to a proinflammatory phenotype at the  level of the circulating leukocyte transcriptome.

Personality risk for antisocial behavior: Testing the intersections between  callous-unemotional traits, sensation seeking, and impulse control in  adolescence.	Mann FD(1), L Paul S(1), Tackett JL(2), Tucker-Drob EM(1), Harden KP(1).	Author information: (1)University of Texas at Austin. (2)Northwestern University.	The current project seeks to integrate literatures on personality risk for  antisocial behavior (ASB) by examining how callous-unemotional traits relate to  (a) the development of disinhibited traits and (b) the association between  disinhibited traits and ASB. In Study 1, using a nationally representative  sample of youth (N > 7,000), we examined whether conduct problems and lack of  guilt assessed during ages 4-10 years predicted levels of and changes in  disinhibited traits over the course of adolescence, and moderated associations  between these traits and ASB. High levels of childhood conduct problems were  associated with higher levels of impulsivity, sensation seeking, and ASB in  early adolescence, whereas lack of guilt was associated with lower levels of  sensation seeking. Neither conduct problems nor lack of guilt significantly  predicted changes in impulsivity or sensation seeking, and associations among  changes in sensation seeking, impulsivity, and ASB were also consistent across  levels of conduct problems and lack of guilt. In Study 2, using a  cross-sectional sample of adolescents (N = 970), we tested whether  callous-unemotional traits moderated associations between disinhibited traits  and ASB. Consistent with the results of Study 1, associations between  disinhibited personality and ASB were consistent across a continuous range of  callous-unemotional traits.

Figge CJ(1), Martinez-Torteya C(1), Weeks JE(2).	Author information: (1)DePaul University. (2)University of Utah.	Extant research consistently links youth externalizing problems and later  maladaptive outcomes, and these behaviors are particularly detrimental given  their relative stability across development. Although an array of risk and  protective factors for externalizing problems have been identified, few studies  have examined factors reflecting the multiple social-ecological levels that  influence child development and used them to predict longitudinal trajectories  of externalizing problems. The current study examined externalizing behavior  trajectories in a sample of 1,094 at-risk youth (539 boys, 555 girls) from the  Longitudinal Studies in Child Abuse and Neglect multisite longitudinal study of  child maltreatment. Normed Child Behavior Checklist externalizing scores were  used to estimate group trajectories via growth-based trajectory modeling at ages  10, 12, 14, and 16 using the SAS PROC TRAJ procedure. Model fit was assessed  using the Bayes information criterion and the Akaike information criterion  statistics. Analyses revealed optimal fit for five distinct behavioral  trajectories: low stable, mid-increasing, mid-decreasing, medium high, and high  stable. Multinomial logistic regressions revealed that a combination of risk and  protective factors at individual, family, school, and neighborhood levels  contribute to distinct trajectories of externalizing problems over time.  Predictors of low and decreasing trajectories can inform interventions aimed at  addressing externalizing problems among high-risk adolescents.

In a randomized controlled trial, the Observational Randomized Controlled Trial  of Childhood Differential Susceptibility (ORCHIDS study), we tested whether  observed parental affect and observed and reported parenting behavior are  mechanisms of change underlying the effects of the behavioral parent training  program the Incredible Years (IY). Furthermore, we tested whether some children  are more susceptible to these change mechanisms because of their temperamental  negative affectivity and/or serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region  (5-HTTLPR) genotype. Participants were 387 Dutch children between 4 and 8 years  of age (M age = 6.31, SD = 1.33; 55.3% boys) and their parents. Results showed  that although IY was successful in improving parenting behavior and increasing  parental positive affect, these effects did not explain the significant  decreases in child externalizing problems. We therefore found no evidence for  changes in parenting behavior or parental affect being the putative mechanisms  of IY effectiveness. Furthermore, intervention effects on child externalizing  behavior were not moderated by child negative affectivity or 5-HTTLPR genotype.  However, child 5-HTTLPR genotype did moderate intervention effects on negative  parenting behavior. This suggests that in research on behavioral parent training  programs, "what works for which parents" might also be an important question.

Early developmental influences on self-esteem trajectories from adolescence  through adulthood: Impact of birth weight and motor skills.	Poole KL(1), Schmidt LA(1), Ferro MA(2), Missiuna C(1), Saigal S(1), Boyle  MH(1), Van Lieshout RJ(1).	Author information: (1)McMaster University. (2)University of Waterloo.	While the trajectory of self-esteem from adolescence to adulthood varies from  person to person, little research has examined how differences in early  developmental processes might affect these pathways. This study examined how  early motor skill development interacted with preterm birth status to predict  self-esteem from adolescence through the early 30s. We addressed this using the  oldest known, prospectively followed cohort of extremely low birth weight (<1000  g) survivors (N = 179) and normal birth weight controls (N = 145) in the world,  born between 1977 and 1982. Motor skills were measured using a performance-based  assessment at age 8 and a retrospective self-report, and self-esteem was  reported during three follow-up periods (age 12-16, age 22-26, and age 29-36).  We found that birth weight status moderated the association between early motor  skills and self-esteem. Stable over three decades, the self-esteem of normal  birth weight participants was sensitive to early motor skills such that those  with poorer motor functioning manifested lower self-esteem, while those with  better motor skills manifested higher self-esteem. Conversely, differences in  motor skill development did not affect the self-esteem from adolescence to  adulthood in individuals born at extremely low birth weight. Early motor skill  development may exert differential effects on self-esteem, depending on whether  one is born at term or prematurely.

Parental depressive history, parenting styles, and child psychopathology over 6  years: The contribution of each parent's depressive history to the other's  parenting styles.	Kopala-Sibley DC(1), Jelinek C(1), Kessel EM(1), Frost A(1), Allmann AES(1),  Klein DN(1).	Author information: (1)Stony Brook University.	The link between parental depressive history and parenting styles is well  established, as is the association of parenting with child psychopathology.  However, little research has examined whether a depressive history in one parent  predicts the parenting style of the other parent. As well, relatively little  research has tested transactional models of the parenting-child psychopathology  relationship in the context of parents' depressive histories. In this study,  mothers and fathers of 392 children were assessed for a lifetime history of  major depression when their children were 3 years old. They then completed  measures of permissiveness and authoritarianism and their child's internalizing  and externalizing symptoms when children were 3, 6, and 9 years old. The results  showed that a depressive history in one parent predicted the other parent's  permissiveness. Analyses then showed that child externalizing symptoms at age 3  predicted maternal permissiveness and authoritarianism and paternal  permissiveness at age 6. Maternal permissiveness at age 6 predicted child  externalizing symptoms at age 9. No relationships in either direction were found  between parenting styles and child internalizing symptoms. The results highlight  the importance of considering both parents' depressive histories when  understanding parenting styles, and support transactional models of parenting  styles and child externalizing symptoms.

Maternal sensitivity has been assessed  in various studies and shown to change with intervention, but in the only study  to formally assess mediation, changes in maternal sensitivity did not mediate  changes in infant security of attachment (Cicchetti, Rogosch, & Toth, 2006).  Primary aims of the current randomized controlled intervention trial in a  high-risk population were to fill gaps in the literature by assessing whether  the intervention (a) reduced disorganization, (b) reduced disrupted maternal  communication, and (c) whether reductions in disrupted maternal communication  mediated changes in infant disorganization. The results indicated that, compared  to controls (n = 52), both infant disorganization and disrupted maternal  communication were significantly reduced in the intervention group (n = 65) that  received regular home-visiting during pregnancy and the first year of life.  Furthermore, reductions in disrupted maternal communication partially accounted  for the observed reductions in infant disorganization compared to randomized  controls. The results are discussed in relation to the societal cost  effectiveness of early attachment-informed interventions for mothers and  infants, as well as the importance of formally assessing underlying mechanisms  of change in order to improve and appropriately target preventive interventions.

Developmental cascade effects of interpersonal psychotherapy for depressed  mothers: Longitudinal associations with toddler attachment, temperament, and  maternal parenting efficacy.	Handley ED(1), Michl-Petzing LC(1), Rogosch FA(1), Cicchetti D(1), Toth SL(1).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	Using a developmental cascades framework, the current study investigated whether  treating maternal depression via interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) may lead to  more widespread positive adaptation for offspring and mothers including benefits  to toddler attachment and temperament, and maternal parenting self-efficacy. The  participants (N = 125 mother-child dyads; mean mother age at baseline = 25.43  years; 54.4% of mothers were African American; mean offspring age at baseline =  13.23 months) were from a randomized controlled trial of IPT for a sample of  racially and ethnically diverse, socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers of  infants. Mothers were randomized to IPT (n = 97) or an enhanced community  standard control group (n = 28). The results of complier average causal effect  modeling showed that engagement with IPT led to significant decreases in  maternal depressive symptoms at posttreatment. Moreover, reductions in maternal  depression posttreatment were associated with less toddler disorganized  attachment characteristics, more adaptive maternal perceptions of toddler  temperament, and improved maternal parenting efficacy 8 months following the  completion of treatment. Our findings contribute to the emerging literature  documenting the potential benefits to children of successfully treating maternal  depression. Alleviating maternal depression appears to initiate a cascade of  positive adaptation among both mothers and offspring, which may alter the  well-documented risk trajectory for offspring of depressed mothers.

Parent-child intervention decreases stress and increases maternal brain activity  and connectivity during own baby-cry: An exploratory study.

(3)East Tennessee State University. (4)Wayne State University.	Parental responses to their children are crucially influenced by stress.  However, brain-based mechanistic understanding of the adverse effects of  parenting stress and benefits of therapeutic interventions is lacking. We  studied maternal brain responses to salient child signals as a function of Mom  Power (MP), an attachment-based parenting intervention established to decrease  maternal distress. Twenty-nine mothers underwent two functional magnetic  resonance imaging brain scans during a baby-cry task designed to solicit  maternal responses to child's or self's distress signals. Between scans, mothers  were pseudorandomly assigned to either MP (n = 14) or control (n = 15) with  groups balanced for depression. Compared to control, MP decreased parenting  stress and increased child-focused responses in social brain areas highlighted  by the precuneus and its functional connectivity with subgenual anterior  cingulate cortex, which are key components of reflective self-awareness and  decision-making neurocircuitry. Furthermore, over 13 weeks, reduction in  parenting stress was related to increasing child- versus self-focused baby-cry  responses in amygdala-temporal pole functional connectivity, which may mediate  maternal ability to take her child's perspective. Although replication in larger  samples is needed, the results of this first parental-brain intervention study  demonstrate robust stress-related brain circuits for maternal care that can be  modulated by psychotherapy.

Author information: (1)University of Delaware.	Negative experiences with a caregiver during infancy can result in long-term  changes in brain function and behavior, but underlying mechanisms are not well  understood. It is our central hypothesis that brain and behavior changes are  conferred by early childhood adversity through epigenetic changes involving DNA  methylation. Using a rodent model of early-life caregiver maltreatment  (involving exposure to an adverse caregiving environment for postnatal days  1-7), we have previously demonstrated abnormal methylation of DNA associated  with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene in the medial prefrontal  cortex (mPFC) of adult rats. The aim of the current study was to characterize  Bdnf DNA methylation in specific cell populations within the mPFC. In the  prefrontal cortex, there is approximately twice as many neurons as glia, and  studies have recently shown differential and distinctive DNA methylation  patterns in neurons versus nonneurons. Here, we extracted nuclei from the mPFC  of adult animals that had experienced maltreatment and used  fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate cell types before performing  bisulfite sequencing to estimate methylation of cytosine-guanine sites. Our data  indicate that early-life stress induced methylation of DNA associated with Bdnf  IV in a cell-type and sex-specific manner. Specifically, females that  experienced early-life maltreatment exhibited greater neuronal cytosine-guanine  methylation compared to controls, while no changes were detected in Bdnf  methylation in males regardless of cell type. These changes localize the  specificity of our previous findings to mPFC neurons and highlight the capacity  of maltreatment to cause methylation changes that are likely to have functional  consequences for neuronal function.

Quevedo K(1), Waters TE(2), Scott H(1), Roisman GI(1), Shaw DS(3), Forbes EE(3).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota. (2)New York University Abu Dhabi. (3)University of Pittsburgh.	There is now ample evidence that the quality of early attachment experiences  shapes expectations for supportive and responsive care and ultimately serves to  scaffold adaptation to the salient tasks of development. Nonetheless, few  studies have identified neural mechanisms that might give rise to these  associations. Using a moderately large sample of low-income male participants  recruited during infancy (N = 171), we studied the predictive significance of  attachment insecurity and disorganization at age 18 months (as measured in the  Strange Situation Procedure) for patterns of neural activation to reward and  loss at age 20 years (assessed during a reward-based task as part of a  functional magnetic resonance imaging scan). Results indicated that individuals  with a history of insecure attachment showed hyperactivity in (a) reward- and  emotion-related (e.g., basal ganglia and amygdala) structures and (b) emotion  regulation and self-referential processing (cortical midline structures) in  response to positive and negative outcomes (and anticipation of those outcomes).  Further, the neural activation of individuals with a history of disorganized  attachment suggested that they had greater emotional reactivity in anticipation  of reward and employed greater cognitive control when negative outcomes were  encountered. Overall, results suggest that the quality of early attachments has  lasting impacts on brain function and reward processing.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417000116 PMID: 28401835 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

A process model of the implications of spillover from coparenting conflicts into  the parent-child attachment relationship in adolescence.	Martin MJ(1), Sturge-Apple ML(1), Davies PT(1), Romero CV(1), Buckholz A(1).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester.	Drawing on a two-wave, multimethod, multi-informant design, this study provides  the first test of a process model of spillover specifying why and how  disruptions in the coparenting relationship influence the parent-adolescent  attachment relationship. One hundred ninety-four families with an adolescent  aged 12-14 (M age = 12.4) were followed for 1 year. Mothers and adolescents  participated in two experimental tasks designed to elicit behavioral expressions  of parent and adolescent functioning within the attachment relationship. Using a  novel observational approach, maternal safe haven, secure base, and harshness  (i.e., hostility and control) were compared as potential unique mediators of the  association between conflict in the coparenting relationship and adolescent  problems. Path models indicated that, although coparenting conflicts were  broadly associated with maternal parenting difficulties, only secure base  explained the link to adolescent adjustment. Adding further specificity to the  process model, maternal secure base support was uniquely associated with  adolescent adjustment through deficits in adolescents' secure exploration.  Results support the hypothesis that coparenting disagreements undermine  adolescent adjustment in multiple domains specifically by disrupting mothers'  ability to provide a caregiving environment that supports adolescent exploration  during a developmental period in which developing autonomy is a crucial  stage-salient task.

Marital stress and children's externalizing behavior as predictors of mothers'  and fathers' parenting.	Elam KK(1), Chassin L(1), Eisenberg N(1), Spinrad TL(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University.	Previous research suggests that mothers' and fathers' parenting may be  differentially influenced by marital and child factors within the family. Some  research indicates that marital stress is more influential in fathers' than  mothers' parenting, whereas other research shows that children's difficult  behavior preferentially affects mothers' parenting. The present study examined  marital stress and children's externalizing behavior in middle childhood as  predictors of mothers' versus fathers' consistency, monitoring, and support and  care in early adolescence, and the subsequent associations of these parenting  behaviors with externalizing behavior 1.5 years later. Pathways were examined  within a longitudinal mediation model testing for moderation by parent gender (N  = 276 mothers, N = 229 fathers). Children's externalizing behavior in middle  childhood was found to more strongly inversely predict mothers' versus fathers'  monitoring in early adolescence. In contrast, marital stress more strongly  predicted low monitoring for fathers than for mothers. Regardless of parent  gender, marital stress predicted lower levels of parental consistency, and  children's externalizing behavior predicted lower levels of parental support.  Mothers' monitoring and fathers' support in early adolescence predicted lower  levels of externalizing behavior 1.5 years later. The results are discussed with  respect to family transactions relative to parent gender and implications for  intervention.

Longitudinal synergies between cortisol reactivity and diurnal testosterone and  antisocial behavior in young adolescents.	Susman EJ(1), Peckins MK(1), Bowes JL(1), Dorn LD(1).	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University.	The aims were to identify the correspondence between simultaneous, longitudinal  changes in cortisol reactivity and diurnal testosterone and to test the  hypothesis that cortisol reactivity and diurnal testosterone interact so as to  influence antisocial behavior. Participants were 135 children and young  adolescents assessed at 6-month intervals over 1 year. Upon enrollment girls  were age 8, 10, or 12 years (N = 69, M = 10.06 years) and boys were age 9, 11,  or 13 years (N = 66, M = 10.94 years). Assessments included Tanner staging by a  nurse, cortisol reactivity (Trier Social Stress Test for Children), diurnal  testosterone, and interviews and questionnaires. Growth models showed that  cortisol reactivity and diurnal testosterone basal levels (intercept) and rate  of change (slopes) were not related, suggesting different mechanisms of growth.  Longitudinal regression analyses assessed cortisol reactivity and diurnal  testosterone longitudinally. The interactions of cortisol reactivity and diurnal  testosterone showed that when diurnal testosterone was low, boys with low  cortisol reactivity were reported to have more behavior problems (i.e.,  oppositional defiant disorder symptoms and attention problems) than when  testosterone was high. In addition, when diurnal testosterone was high, boys  with high or moderate cortisol reactivity were significantly higher on total  antisocial behavior, attention behavior problems, and oppositional defiant  disorder symptoms than when testosterone was low or moderate. The results were  similar but less frequent for girls. These findings advance the science of young  adolescence by showing the interaction between preexisting sensitivity to  stressors and the normative testosterone changes of puberty and antisocial  behavior.

Suicide ideation among high-risk adolescent females: Examining the interplay  between parasympathetic regulation and friendship support.

(3)University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. (4)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. (5)Harvard University.	Poor physiological self-regulation has been proposed as a potential biological  vulnerability for adolescent suicidality. This study tested this hypothesis by  examining the effect of parasympathetic stress responses on future suicide  ideation. In addition, drawing from multilevel developmental psychopathology  theories, the interplay between parasympathetic regulation and friendship  support, conceptualized as an external source of regulation, was examined. At  baseline, 132 adolescent females (M age = 14.59, SD = 1.39) with a history of  mental health concerns participated in an in vivo interpersonal stressor (a  laboratory speech task) and completed self-report measures of depressive  symptoms and perceived support within a close same-age female friendship.  Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was measured before and during the speech  task. Suicide ideation was assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 9 months  follow-up. The results revealed that females with greater relative RSA decreases  to the laboratory stressor were at higher risk for reporting suicide ideation  over the subsequent 9 months. Moreover, parasympathetic responses moderated the  effect of friendship support on suicide ideation; among females with mild  changes or higher relative increases in RSA, but not more pronounced RSA  decreases, friendship support reduced risk for future suicide ideation. Findings  highlight the crucial role of physiological and external regulation sources as  protective factors for youth suicidality.

Affective startle potentiation differentiates primary and secondary variants of  juvenile psychopathy.	Kimonis ER(1), Fanti KA(2), Goulter N(1), Hall J(3).	Author information: (1)University of New South Wales. (2)University of Cyprus. (3)University of South Florida.	Individuals with psychopathic traits show an attenuated emotional response to  aversive stimuli. However, recent evidence suggests heterogeneity in emotional  reactivity among individuals with psychopathic or callous-unemotional (CU)  traits in the identification of primary and secondary subtypes, or variants. We  hypothesized that primary CU variants will respond with blunted affect to  negatively valenced stimuli, whereas individuals with a history of childhood  maltreatment, fitting with theoretical conceptualizations of secondary  psychopathy, will display heightened emotional reactivity. To test this  hypothesis, we examined fear-potentiated startle between CU variants while  viewing aversive, pleasant, and neutral scenes. Two hundred thirty-eight  incarcerated adolescent (M age = 16.8 years, SD = 1.11 years) boys completed a  picture-startle paradigm and self-report questionnaires assessing CU traits,  aggressive behavior, and maltreatment. Latent profile analysis of CU trait,  aggression, and maltreatment scores identified four classes: primary psychopathy  variants (high CU traits, high aggression, low maltreatment; n = 46), secondary  psychopathy variants (high CU traits, high aggression, high maltreatment; n =  42), and two nonpsychopathic groups differentiated on maltreatment experience (n  = 148). Primary CU variants displayed reduced startle potentiation to aversive  images relative to control, maltreated, and also secondary variants that  exhibited greater startle modulation. Findings add to a rapidly growing body of  literature supporting the possibility of multiple developmental pathways to  psychopathic traits (i.e., equifinality), and extend it by finding support for  divergent potential biomarkers between primary and secondary CU variants.

Improving children's learning and development in conflict-affected countries is  critically important for breaking the intergenerational transmission of violence  and poverty. Yet there is currently a stunning lack of rigorous evidence as to  whether and how programs to improve learning and development in  conflict-affected countries actually work to bolster children's academic  learning and socioemotional development. This study tests a theory of change  derived from the fields of developmental psychopathology and social ecology  about how a school-based universal socioemotional learning program, the  International Rescue Committee's Learning to Read in a Healing Classroom (LRHC),  impacts children's learning and development. The study was implemented in three  conflict-affected provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and employed  a cluster-randomized waitlist control design to estimate impact. Using  multilevel structural equation modeling techniques, we found support for the  central pathways in the LRHC theory of change. Specifically, we found that LRHC  differentially impacted dimensions of the quality of the school and classroom  environment at the end of the first year of the intervention, and that in turn  these dimensions of quality were differentially associated with child academic  and socioemotional outcomes. Future implications and directions are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416001139 PMID: 27866501 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Over 1 billion children worldwide are exposed to political violence and armed  conflict. The current conclusions are qualified by limited longitudinal research  testing sophisticated process-oriented explanatory models for child adjustment  outcomes. In this study, consistent with a developmental psychopathology  perspective emphasizing the value of process-oriented longitudinal study of  child adjustment in developmental and social-ecological contexts, we tested  emotional insecurity about the community as a dynamic, within-person mediating  process for relations between sectarian community violence and child adjustment.  Specifically, this study explored children's emotional insecurity at a  person-oriented level of analysis assessed over 5 consecutive years, with child  gender examined as a moderator of indirect effects between sectarian community  violence and child adjustment. In the context of a five-wave longitudinal  research design, participants included 928 mother-child dyads in Belfast (453  boys, 475 girls) drawn from socially deprived, ethnically homogenous areas that  had experienced political violence. Youth ranged in age from 10 to 20 years and  were 13.24 (SD = 1.83) years old on average at the initial time point. Greater  insecurity about the community measured over multiple time points mediated  relations between sectarian community violence and youth's total adjustment  problems. The pathway from sectarian community violence to emotional insecurity  about the community was moderated by child gender, with relations to emotional  insecurity about the community stronger for girls than for boys. The results  suggest that ameliorating children's insecurity about community in contexts of  political violence is an important goal toward improving adolescents' well-being  and adjustment. These results are discussed in terms of their translational  research implications, consistent with a developmental psychopathology model for  the interface between basic and intervention research.

Testing the biological embedding hypothesis: Is early life adversity associated  with a later proinflammatory phenotype?	Ehrlich KB(1), Ross KM(2), Chen E(3), Miller GE(3).	Author information: (1)University of Georgia. (2)University of California at Los Angeles. (3)Northwestern University.	Accumulating evidence suggests that the experience of early life adversity is a  risk factor for a range of poor outcomes across development, including poor  physical health in adulthood. The biological embedding model of early adversity  (Miller, Chen, & Parker, 2011) suggests that early adversity might become  embedded within immune cells known as monocytes/macrophages, programming them to  be overly aggressive to environmental stimuli and insensitive to inhibitory  signals, creating a "proinflammatory phenotype" that increases vulnerability to  chronic diseases across the life span. We tested this hypothesis in the present  study. Adolescent girls (n = 147) had blood drawn every 6 months across a  2.5-year period. To assess inflammatory responses to challenge, their monocytes  were stimulated in vitro with a bacterial product, and production of the  cytokine interleukin-6 was quantified. Hydrocortisone was added to cultures to  assess the cells' sensitivity to glucocorticoids' anti-inflammatory signal.  Using cluster analyses, we found that early life adversity was associated with  greater odds of displaying a proinflammatory phenotype characterized by  relatively larger interleukin-6 responses and relatively less sensitivity to  glucocorticoids. In contrast, ongoing social stress was not associated with  increasing odds of being categorized in the proinflammatory cluster. These  findings suggest that early life adversity increases the probability of  developing a proinflammatory phenotype, which, if sustained, could forecast risk  for health problems later in life.

Insight from animal models of environmentally driven epigenetic changes in the  developing and adult brain.	Doherty TS(1), Roth TL(1).	Author information: (1)University of Delaware,Newark.	The efforts of many neuroscientists are directed toward understanding the  appreciable plasticity of the brain and behavior. In recent years, epigenetics  has become a core of this focus as a prime mechanistic candidate for behavioral  modifications. Animal models have been instrumental in advancing our  understanding of environmentally driven changes to the epigenome in the  developing and adult brain. This review focuses mainly on such discoveries  driven by adverse environments along with their associated behavioral outcomes.  While much of the evidence discussed focuses on epigenetics within the central  nervous system, several peripheral studies in humans who have experienced  significant adversity are also highlighted. As we continue to unravel the link  between epigenetics and phenotype, discerning the complexity and specificity of  epigenetic changes induced by environments is an important step toward  understanding optimal development and how to prevent or ameliorate behavioral  deficits bred by disruptive environments.

Champagne FA(1).	Author information: (1)Columbia University.	The quality of the environment experienced by an individual across his or her  lifespan can result in a unique developmental trajectory with consequences for  adult phenotype and reproductive success. However, it is also evident that these  experiences can impact the development of offspring with continued effect on  subsequent generations. Epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed as a mediator  of both these within- and across-generation effects, and there is increasing  evidence to support the role of environmentally induced changes in DNA  methylation, posttranslational histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs in  predicting these outcomes. Advances in our understanding of these molecular  modifications contribute to increasingly nuanced perspectives on plasticity and  transmission of phenotypes across generations. A challenge that emerges from  this research is in how we integrate these "new" perspectives with traditional  views of development, reproduction, and inheritance. This paper will highlight  evidence suggestive of an epigenetic impact of the environment on mothers,  fathers, and their offspring, and illustrate the importance of considering the  dynamic nature of reproduction and development and inclusive views of  inheritance within the evolving field of behavioral and environmental  epigenetics.

Maternal mental well-being during pregnancy and glucocorticoid receptor gene  promoter methylation in the neonate.

Maternal mental health during pregnancy has been linked to health outcomes in  progeny. Mounting evidence implicates fetal "programming" in this process,  possibly via epigenetic disruption. Maternal mental health has been associated  with glucocorticoid receptor methylation (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C,  member 1 [NR3C1]) in the neonate; however, most studies have been small (n <  100) and have failed to control for multiple testing in the statistical  analysis. The Barwon Infant Study is a population-derived birth cohort with  antenatal recruitment. Maternal depression and anxiety were assessed using the  Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and psychological distress using the  Perceived Stress Scale. NR3C1 cord blood methylation levels were determined  using Sequenom MassArray for 481 participants. Maternal psychological distress  and anxiety were associated with a small increase in neonate NR3C1 methylation  at specific CpG sites, thus replicating some previous findings. However,  associations were only nominally significant and did not remain after correction  for the number of CpG sites and exposures investigated. As the largest study to  explore the relationship between maternal well-being and offspring NR3C1 cord  blood methylation, our results highlight the need for caution when interpreting  previous findings in this area. Future studies must ensure they are adequately  powered to detect the likely small effect sizes while controlling for multiple  testing.

Laurent HK(1), Harold GT(2), Leve L(1), Shelton KH(3), Van Goozen SH(3).	Author information: (1)University of Oregon. (2)University of Sussex. (3)Cardiff University.	Early identification of problems with psychosocial stress regulation is  important for supporting mental and physical health. However, we currently lack  knowledge about when reliable individual differences in stress-responsive  physiology emerge and which aspects of maternal behavior determine the unfolding  of infants' stress responses. Knowledge of these processes is further limited by  analytic approaches that do not account for multiple levels of within- and  between-family effects. In a low-risk sample (n = 100 dyads), we observed infant  cortisol and mother/infant behavior during regular play and stress sessions  longitudinally from age 1 to 3, and used a three-level model to separately  examine variability in infant cortisol trajectories within sessions, across  years, and across infants. Stable individual differences in  hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation were observed in the first 3  years of life. Infants of less sensitive and more intrusive mothers manifested  stress sensitization, that is, elevated cortisol levels during and following  stress exposure, a profile related to behavioral distress. These findings have  important practical implications, suggesting that children at risk for long-term  stress dysregulation may be identified in the earliest years of life.

Longitudinal phenotypes for alcoholism: Heterogeneity of course, early  identifiers, and life course correlates.	Jester JM(1), Buu A(1), Zucker RA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Michigan.	Alcoholism is a heterogeneous disorder; however, characterization of life-course  variations in symptomatology is almost nonexistent, and developmentally early  predictors of variations are very poorly characterized. In this study, the  course of alcoholic symptomatology over 32 years is differentiated, and  predictors and covariates of trajectory class membership are identified. A  community sample of alcoholic and neighborhood matched control families, 332 men  and 336 women, was recruited based on alcoholism in the men. Symptoms were  assessed retrospectively at baseline (mean age = 32) back to age 15 and  prospectively from baseline every 3 years for 15 years. Trajectory classes were  established using growth mixture modeling. Men and women had very similarly  shaped trajectory classes: developmentally limited (men: 29%, women: 42%),  developmentally cumulative (men: 26%, women: 38%), young adult onset (men: 31%,  women: 21%), and early onset severe (men: 13%). Three factors at age 15  predicted class membership: family history of alcoholism, age 15 symptoms, and  level of childhood antisocial behavior. Numerous measures of drinking and other  psychopathology were also associated with class membership. The findings suggest  that clinical assessments can be crafted where the profile of current and  historical information can predict not only severity of prognosis but also  future moderation of symptoms and/or remission over intervals as long as  decades.

The long-term effectiveness of the Family Check-Up on school-age conduct  problems: Moderation by neighborhood deprivation.

(3)University of California at Davis. (4)Arizona State University. (5)University of Virginia. (6)University of Oxford.	Several studies suggest that neighborhood deprivation is a unique risk factor in  child and adolescent development of problem behavior. We sought to examine  whether previously established intervention effects of the Family Check-Up (FCU)  on child conduct problems at age 7.5 would persist through age 9.5, and whether  neighborhood deprivation would moderate these effects. In addition, we examined  whether improvements in parent-child interaction during early childhood  associated with the FCU would be related to later reductions in child aggression  among families living in the highest risk neighborhoods. Using a multisite  cohort of at-risk children identified on the basis of family, child, and  socioeconomic risk and randomly assigned to the FCU, intervention effects were  found to be moderated by neighborhood deprivation, such that they were only  directly present for those living at moderate versus extreme levels of  neighborhood deprivation. In addition, improvements in child aggression were  evident for children living in extreme neighborhood deprivation when parents  improved the quality of their parent-child interaction during the toddler period  (i.e., moderated mediation). Implications of the findings are discussed in  relation to the possibilities and possible limitations in prevention of early  problem behavior for those children living in extreme and moderate levels of  poverty.

Early unpredictability predicts increased adolescent externalizing behaviors and  substance use: A life history perspective.	Doom JR(1), Vanzomeren-Dohm AA(1), Simpson JA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development.	Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2016 Nov;28(4pt2):1571.	According to evolutionary life history models, environmental harshness and  unpredictability can both promote a fast life history strategy characterized by  increased risk taking and enacting short-term, opportunistic behaviors. The  current longitudinal study tests whether environmental unpredictability during  childhood has stronger effects on risky behavior during adolescence than  harshness, and whether there may be an early "sensitive period" during which  unpredictability has particularly strong and unique effects on these outcomes.  Using data from the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation,  prospective assessments of environmental unpredictability (changes in residence,  cohabitation, and parental occupation) and harshness (mean socioeconomic status)  from birth into adolescence were used to predict self-reported externalizing  behaviors and substance use at age 16 (N = 220). Exposure to greater early  unpredictability (between ages 0 and 5) predicted more externalizing behaviors  as well as more alcohol and marijuana use at age 16, controlling for harshness  and later unpredictability (between ages 6 and 16). Harshness predicted  adolescent substance use, and later unpredictability predicted adolescent  externalizing behaviors at the trend level. Early unpredictability and harshness  also interacted, such that the highest levels of risk taking occurred in  individuals who experienced more early unpredictability and lived in harsher  environments. Age 16 externalizing behaviors, but not substance use, mediated  the association between early unpredictability and externalizing/criminal  behaviors at age 23. We discuss how exposure to early environmental  unpredictability may alter biological and social-cognitive functioning from a  life history perspective.

Maternal abuse history and reduced fetal heart rate variability: Abuse-related  sleep disturbance is a mediator.	Gustafsson H(1), Doyle C(2), Gilchrist M(3), Werner E(1), Monk C(1).	Author information: (1)Columbia University Medical Center. (2)University of Minnesota. (3)DePaul University.	The consequences of childhood maltreatment are profound and long lasting. Not  only does the victim of abuse suffer as a child, but there is mounting evidence  that a history of maltreatment places the next generation at risk for  significant psychopathology. Research identifies postnatal factors as affecting  this intergenerational transmission of trauma. However, emerging evidence  suggests that part of this risk may be transmitted before birth, passed on via  abuse-related alterations in the in utero environment that are as yet largely  unidentified. To date, no study has directly assessed the influence of pregnant  women's abuse history on fetal neurobehavioral development, nor considered  trauma-associated poor sleep quality as a mediator reflecting established  physiological dysregulation. Using data from 262 pregnant adolescents (ages  14-19), a population at elevated risk for childhood maltreatment, the current  study examined maternal emotional abuse history and sleep quality in relation to  third-trimester fetal resting heart rate variability, an index of  parasympathetic nervous system functioning. The results indicate that maternal  emotional abuse history is indirectly associated with lower fetal heart rate  variability via abuse-related sleep disturbances. These data demonstrate an  association between maternal abuse histories and fetal development, showing that  at least part of the intergenerational transmission of risk occurs during  pregnancy.

(3)State of Connecticut Court Support Services Division.	This study reports findings from the administration of a social problem-solving  training (SPST) intervention to juvenile detainees in the Connecticut Youth  Detainee Program. SPST is a cognitive behavioral intervention that teaches  children and youth how to more effectively cope with interpersonal stress and  conflict. In the current study, we tested whether SPST could decrease depressive  symptoms in a sample of detained adolescent offenders. The study used a  randomized-control design with detention staff administering the intervention.  The results showed that SPST, as a main effect, was not more effective in  reducing depressive symptoms than treatment as usual. However, the effectiveness  of SPST was moderated by fluid intelligence. Juvenile detainees with high  intelligence scores were most likely to benefit from SPST compared to treatment  as usual. It was surprising that, for those with lower intelligence scores, SPST  increased depressive symptoms relative to treatment as usual. These results help  fill a critical need for intervention effectiveness data on juvenile detainees  and indicate that SPST may not be useful for reducing outcomes such as  depression.

Beyond risk: Prospective effects of GABA Receptor Subunit Alpha-2 (GABRA2) ×  Positive Peer Involvement on adolescent behavior.	Trucco EM(1), Villafuerte S(1), Burmeister M(1), Zucker RA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Michigan.	Research on Gene × Environment interactions typically focuses on maladaptive  contexts and outcomes. However, the same genetic factors may also impact  susceptibility to positive social contexts, leading to adaptive behavior. This  paper examines whether the GABA receptor subunit alpha-2 (GABRA2) single  nucleotide polymorphism rs279858 moderates the influence of positive peer  affiliation on externalizing behavior and various forms of competence. Regions  of significance were calculated to determine whether the form of the interaction  supported differential susceptibility (increased sensitivity to both low and  high positive peer affiliation) or vantage sensitivity (increased sensitivity to  high positive peer affiliation). It was hypothesized that those carrying the  homozygous minor allele (GG) would be more susceptible to peer effects. A sample  (n = 300) of primarily male (69.7%) and White (93.0%) adolescents from the  Michigan Longitudinal Study was assessed from ages 12 to 17. There was evidence  for prospective Gene × Environment interactions in three of the four models. At  low levels of positive peer involvement, those with the GG genotype were rated  as having fewer adaptive outcomes, while at high levels they were rated as  having greater adaptive outcomes. This supports differential susceptibility.  Conceptualizing GABRA2 variants as purely risk factors may be inaccurate.  Genetic differences in susceptibility to adaptive environmental exposures  warrants further investigation.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416000419 PMCID: PMC5010003 PMID: 27581089 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

How do parents' depression and anxiety, and infants' negative temperament relate  to parent-infant face-to-face interactions?	Aktar E(1), Colonnesi C(1), de Vente W(1), Majdandžić M(1), Bögels SM(1).	Author information: (1)University of Amsterdam.	The present study investigated the associations of mothers' and fathers'  lifetime depression and anxiety symptoms, and of infants' negative temperament  with parents' and infants' gaze, facial expressions of emotion, and synchrony.  We observed infants' (age between 3.5 and 5.5 months, N = 101) and parents' gaze  and facial expressions during 4-min naturalistic face-to-face interactions.  Parents' lifetime symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed with clinical  interviews, and infants' negative temperament was measured with standardized  observations. Parents with more depressive symptoms and their infants expressed  less positive and more neutral affect. Parents' lifetime anxiety symptoms were  not significantly related to parents' expressions of affect, while they were  linked to longer durations of gaze to parent, and to more positive and negative  affect in infants. Parents' lifetime depression or anxiety was not related to  synchrony. Infants' temperament did not predict infants' or parents' interactive  behavior. The study reveals that more depression symptoms in parents are linked  to more neutral affect from parents and from infants during face-to-face  interactions, while parents' anxiety symptoms are related to more attention to  parent and less neutral affect from infants (but not from parents).

Author information: (1)Auburn University. (2)University of Michigan. (3)University of Minnesota.	Gene × Environment interaction contributes to externalizing disorders in  childhood and adolescence, but little is known about whether such effects are  long lasting or present in adulthood. We examined gene-environment interplay in  the concurrent and prospective associations between antisocial peer affiliation  and externalizing disorders (antisocial behavior and substance use disorders) at  ages 17, 20, 24, and 29. The sample included 1,382 same-sex twin pairs  participating in the Minnesota Twin Family Study. We detected a Gene ×  Environment interaction at age 17, such that additive genetic influences on  antisocial behavior and substance use disorders were greater in the context of  greater antisocial peer affiliation. This Gene × Environment interaction was not  present for antisocial behavior symptoms after age 17, but it was for substance  use disorder symptoms through age 29 (though effect sizes were largest at age  17). The results suggest adolescence is a critical period for the development of  externalizing disorders wherein exposure to greater environmental adversity is  associated with a greater expression of genetic risk. This form of Gene ×  Environment interaction may persist through young adulthood for substance use  disorders, but it appears to be limited to adolescence for antisocial behavior.

Developmental cascade models of a parenting-focused program for divorced  families on mental health problems and substance use in emerging adulthood.	Wolchik SA(1), Tein JY(1), Sandler IN(1), Kim HJ(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University.	A developmental cascade model from functioning in adolescence to emerging  adulthood was tested using data from a 15-year longitudinal follow-up of 240  emerging adults whose families participated in a randomized, experimental trial  of a preventive program for divorced families. Families participated in the  program or literature control condition when the offspring were ages 9-12.  Short-term follow-ups were conducted 3 months and 6 months following completion  of the program when the offspring were in late childhood/early adolescence.  Long-term follow-ups were conducted 6 years and 15 years after program  completion when the offspring were in middle to late adolescence and emerging  adulthood, respectively. It was hypothesized that the impact of the program on  mental health and substance use outcomes in emerging adulthood would be  explained by developmental cascade effects of program effects in adolescence.  The results provided support for a cascade effects model. Specifically, academic  competence in adolescence had cross-domain effects on internalizing problems and  externalizing problems in emerging adulthood. In addition, adaptive coping in  adolescence was significantly, negatively related to binge drinking. It was  unexpected that internalizing symptoms in adolescence were significantly  negatively related to marijuana use and alcohol use. Gender differences occurred  in the links between mental health problems and substance use in adolescence and  mental health problems and substance use in emerging adulthood.

Tiberio SS(1), Capaldi DM(1), Kerr DC(1), Bertrand M(2), Pears KC(1), Owen L(1).	Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center. (2)Oberlin College.	Poor effortful control is a key temperamental factor underlying behavioral  problems. The bidirectional association of child effortful control with both  positive parenting and negative discipline was examined from ages approximately  3 to 13-14 years, involving five time points, and using data from parents and  children in the Oregon Youth Study-Three Generational Study (N = 318 children  from 150 families). Based on a dynamic developmental systems approach, it was  hypothesized that there would be concurrent associations between parenting and  child effortful control and bidirectional effects across time from each aspect  of parenting to effortful control and from effortful control to each aspect of  parenting. It was also hypothesized that associations would be more robust in  early childhood, from ages 3 to 7 years, and would diminish as indicated by  significantly weaker effects at the older ages, 11-12 to 13-14 years.  Longitudinal feedback or mediated effects were also tested. The findings  supported (a) stability in each construct over multiple developmental periods;  (b) concurrent associations, which were significantly weaker at the older ages;	(c) bidirectional effects, consistent with the interpretation that at younger  ages children's effortful control influenced parenting, whereas at older child  ages, parenting influenced effortful control; and (d) a transactional effect,  such that maternal parenting in late childhood was a mechanism explaining  children's development of effortful control from middle childhood to early  adolescence.

Sandler I(1), Tein JY(1), Cham H(2), Wolchik S(1), Ayers T(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University. (2)Fordham University.	This study reports on the findings from a 6-year follow-up of a randomized trial  of the Family Bereavement Program (FBP) on the outcomes for spousally bereaved  parents. Spousally bereaved parents (N = 131) participated in the trial in which  they were randomly assigned to receive the FBP (N = 72) or literature control (N  = 59). Parents were assessed at four time points: pretest, posttest, and  11-month and 6-year follow-up. They reported on mental health problems, grief,  and parenting at all four time periods. At the 6-year follow-up, parents  reported on additional measures of persistent complex bereavement disorder,  alcohol abuse problems, and coping efficacy. Bereaved parents in the FBP as  compared to those in the literature control had lower levels of symptoms of  depression, general psychiatric distress, prolonged grief, and alcohol problems,  and higher coping efficacy (for mothers) at the 6-year follow-up. Multiple  characteristics of the parent (e.g., gender, age, and baseline mental health  problems) and of the spousal death (e.g., cause of death) were tested as  moderators of program effects on each outcome, but only 3 of 45 tests of  moderation were significant. Latent growth modeling found that the effects of  the FBP on depression, psychiatric distress, and grief occurred immediately  following program participation and were maintained over 6 years. Mediation  analysis found that improvement in positive parenting partially mediated program  effects to reduce depression and psychiatric distress, but had an indirect  effect to higher levels of grief at the 6-year follow-up. Mediation analysis  also found that improved parenting at the 6-year follow-up was partially  mediated by program effects to reduce depression and that program effects to  increase coping efficacy at the 6-year follow-up was partially mediated through  reduced depression and grief and improved parenting. FBP reduced mental health  problems, prolonged grief, and alcohol abuse, and increased coping efficacy of  spousally bereaved parents 6 years later. Mediation pathways for program effects  differed across outcomes at the 6-year follow-up.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416000328 PMCID: PMC5026637 PMID: 27427807 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

(2)Research Triangle Institute. (3)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.	Child conduct problems (CP) reflect a heterogeneous collection of oppositional,  aggressive, norm-violating, and sometimes violent behaviors, whereas child  callous-unemotional (CU) behaviors reflect interpersonal styles of interactions  reflecting a lack of guilt and empathy as well as uncaring and shallow emotional  responses to others. Taken together, high levels of child CP and CU behaviors  are thought to identify a relatively homogenous group of children at elevated  risk for persistent and more severe problem behaviors across childhood and into  adulthood. Although a large body of research has examined the developmental  etiology of CP behaviors, only recently has a developmental psychopathology  approach been applied to early CU behaviors. The current study examines multiple  levels of contextual influences during the first years of life, including family  socioeconomic status, household chaos, and parenting behaviors, on CP and CU  behaviors assessed during the first-grade year. Whereas previous studies found  associations between parenting behaviors and child problem behaviors moderated  by household chaos, the current study found no evidence of moderation. However,  path analyses suggest that the associations between child CP and CU behaviors  and the contextual variables of socioeconomic status (family income and parental  education) and household chaos (disorganization and instability) were mediated  by maternal sensitive and harsh-intrusive parenting behavior. Analyses are  presented, interpreted, and discussed with respect to both bioecological and  family stress models of development.

Developmental psychopathologists face the difficult task of identifying the  environmental conditions that may contribute to early childhood behavior  problems. Highly stressed caregivers can exacerbate behavior problems, while  children with behavior problems may make parenting more difficult and increase  caregiver stress. Unknown is: (a) how these transactions originate, (b) whether  they persist over time to contribute to the development of problem behavior and  (c) what role resilience factors, such as child executive functioning, may play  in mitigating the development of problem behavior. In the present study,  transactional relations between caregiving stress, executive functioning, and  behavior problems were examined in a sample of 1,388 children with prenatal drug  exposures at three developmental time points: early childhood (birth to age 5),  middle childhood (ages 6 to 9), and early adolescence (ages 10 to 13).  Transactional relations differed between caregiving stress and internalizing  versus externalizing behavior. Targeting executive functioning in evidence-based  interventions for children with prenatal substance exposure who present with  internalizing problems and treating caregiving psychopathology, depression, and  parenting stress in early childhood may be particularly important for children  presenting with internalizing behavior.

(3)Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. (4)University of Bristol.	This study sought to identify trajectories of DSM-IV based internalizing (INT)  and externalizing (EXT) problem scores across childhood and adolescence and to  provide insight into the comorbidity by modeling the co-occurrence of INT and  EXT trajectories. INT and EXT were measured repeatedly between age 7 and age 15  years in over 7,000 children and analyzed using growth mixture models. Five  trajectories were identified for both INT and EXT, including very low, low,  decreasing, and increasing trajectories. In addition, an adolescent onset  trajectory was identified for INT and a stable high trajectory was identified  for EXT. Multinomial regression showed that similar EXT and INT trajectories  were associated. However, the adolescent onset INT trajectory was independent of  high EXT trajectories, and persisting EXT was mainly associated with decreasing  INT. Sex and early life environmental risk factors predicted EXT and, to a  lesser extent, INT trajectories. The association between trajectories indicates  the need to consider comorbidity when a child presents with INT or EXT  disorders, particularly when symptoms start early. This is less necessary when  INT symptoms start at adolescence. Future studies should investigate the  etiology of co-occurring INT and EXT and the specific treatment needs of these  severely affected children.

Relations between restricted and repetitive behavior at age 26 months and  children's concurrent (N = 203) and later (n = 161) social cognition and  language development were investigated. Restricted and repetitive behavior was  assessed using two scales: sensory and motor repetitive behaviors and  rigidity/routines/restricted interests. Language was assessed at ages 26 and 51  months; social cognition was assessed at ages 26 (symbolic play) and 51 and 61  months (theory of mind). Sensory and motor repetitive behavior was negatively  related to children's (a) language performance at 26 and 51 months, (b)  instructed symbolic play at 26 months, and (c) theory of mind performance at 51  and 61 months. Path analyses showed that children's sensory and motor repetitive  behavior at age 26 months was related to lower receptive verbal ability and  theory of mind at 51 months, which led to lower theory of mind at 61 months.  Rigidity/routines/restricted interests at 26 months were unrelated to concurrent  and later social cognition and language. These results are discussed in terms of  the pathways via which sensory and motor repetitive behavior might impact  negatively on development.

Brock RL(1), Kochanska G(1).	Author information: (1)University of Iowa.	Drawing from developmental psychology and psychopathology, we propose a new,  developmentally informed approach to parenting interventions that focuses on  elucidating changes in the unfolding developmental process between the parent  and child. We present data from 186 low-income mothers of toddlers, randomly  assigned to a child-oriented play group or a play-as-usual group. We examined  the maladaptive cascade from child difficulty to mother adversarial, negative  parenting to child maladjustment, well documented in the literature. The  measures incorporated multiple observations and reports. As expected, the  sequence from child difficulty (pretest) to mother adversarial, negative  parenting (Posttest 1, after 3-month intervention) to child maladjustment  (Posttest 2, 6 months later) was present in the play-as-usual group, but absent,  or defused, in the child-oriented play group. The findings are consistent with a  view of intervention presumably enhancing the mother-child relationship, which  in turn served to moderate future mother-child dynamics, altering its otherwise  anticipated negative trajectory. A closer examination of the cascade revealed  that, at Posttest 1, mothers in the play-as-usual group engaged in more  adversarial, negative parenting (controlling for pretest) than did mothers in  the child-oriented play group when their children were of high difficulty. The  intervention appears to exert its primary influence on the cascade by weakening  the link between child difficulty and maternal adversarial, negative parenting.

Longitudinal investigation of anxiety sensitivity growth trajectories and  relations with anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescence.	Allan NP(1), Felton JW(2), Lejuez CW(2), MacPherson L(2), Schmidt NB(1).	Author information: (1)Florida State University. (2)University of Maryland Center for Addictions,Personality,and Emotion  Research.	Anxiety sensitivity (AS), the belief that anxious arousal is harmful, is a  malleable risk factor that has been implicated in anxiety and depression  symptoms in adolescents. Although there is some evidence that adolescents  possess distinct developmental trajectories, few studies have explored this  topic. This study examined the developmental trajectory of AS in 248 adolescents  (M age = 11.0 years, SD = 0.82; 56% male) across 6 years, beginning when  children were age 11. This study also examined the influence of AS trajectories  on anxiety and depression at age 16. Finally, this study examined the utility of  AS classes in identifying anxiety and depression growth. Three AS classes were  found, described by normative-stable, high-stable, and high-unstable  trajectories. Adolescents in the high-stable and the high-unstable AS classes  had higher levels of anxiety and depression at age 16 than did adolescents in  the normative-stable AS class. In addition, the anxiety and depression  trajectories fit by AS class mirrored the AS class trajectories. These findings  suggest three AS trajectories can be identified in adolescents. These  trajectories are discussed in relation to a developmental perspective of AS.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415000590 PMID: 27063894 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Neuropsychological performance measures as intermediate phenotypes for  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A multiple mediation analysis.	Kamradt JM(1), Nigg JT(2), Friderici KH(3), Nikolas MA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Iowa. (2)Oregon Health and Science University. (3)Michigan State University.	Genetic influences on dopaminergic neurotransmission have been implicated in  attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and are theorized to impact  cognitive functioning via alterations in frontal-striatal circuitry.  Neuropsychological functioning has been proposed to account for the potential  associations between dopamine candidate genes and ADHD. However, to date, this  mediation hypothesis has not been directly tested. Participants were 498 youth  ages 6-17 years (mean M = 10.8 years, SD = 2.4 years, 55.0% male). All youth  completed a multistage, multiple-informant assessment procedure to identify ADHD  and non-ADHD cases, as well as a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Youth  provided a saliva sample for DNA analyses; the 480 base pair variable number of  tandem repeat polymorphism of the dopamine active transporter 1 gene (DAT1) and  the 120 base pair promoter polymorphism of the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4)  were genotyped. Multiple mediation analysis revealed significant indirect  associations between DAT1 genotype and inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity,  and oppositionality, with specific indirect effects through response inhibition.  The results highlight the role of neurocognitive task performance, particularly  response inhibition, as a potential intermediate phenotype for ADHD, further  elucidating the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and externalizing  psychopathology.

The interaction between the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) variable number tandem  repeat polymorphism and perceived peer drinking norms in adolescent alcohol use  and misuse.

(2)SUNY Upstate Medical University. (3)University of Missouri. (4)Miriam Hospital. (5)Brown University.	Peer drinking norms are arguably one of the strongest correlates of adolescent  drinking. Prospective studies indicate that adolescents tend to select peers  based on drinking (peer selection) and their peers' drinking is associated with  changes in adolescent drinking over time (peer socialization). The present study  investigated whether the peer selection and socialization processes in  adolescent drinking differed as a function of the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4)  variable number tandem repeat genotype in two independent prospective data sets.  The first sample was 174 high school students drawn from a two-wave 6-month  prospective study. The second sample was 237 college students drawn from a  three-wave annual prospective study. Multigroup cross-lagged panel analyses of  the high school student sample indicated stronger socialization via peer  drinking norms among carriers, whereas analyses of the college student sample  indicated stronger drinking-based peer selection in the junior year among  carriers, compared to noncarriers. Although replication and meta-analytic  synthesis are needed, these findings suggest that in part genetically determined  peer selection (carriers of the DRD4 seven-repeat allele tend to associate with  peers who have more favorable attitudes toward drinking and greater alcohol use)  and peer socialization (carriers' subsequent drinking behaviors are more  strongly associated with their peer drinking norms) may differ across adolescent  developmental stages.

Latent trajectories of adolescent antisocial behavior: Serotonin transporter  linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genotype influences sensitivity to  perceived parental support.	Tung I(1), Lee SS(1).	Author information: (1)University of California,Los Angeles.	Although prevailing theories of antisocial behavior (ASB) emphasize distinct  developmental trajectories, few studies have explored gene-environment interplay  underlying membership in empirically derived trajectories. To improve knowledge  about the development of overt (e.g., aggression) and covert (e.g., delinquency)  ASB, we tested the association of the 44-base pair promoter polymorphism in the  serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region gene (5-HTTLPR), perceived  parental support (e.g., closeness and warmth), and their interaction with ASB  trajectories derived using latent class growth analysis in 2,558 adolescents  followed prospectively into adulthood from the National Longitudinal Study of  Adolescent Health. Three distinct trajectories emerged for overt (low desisting,  adolescent peak, and late onset) and covert ASB (high stable, low stable, and  nonoffending). Controlling for sex, parental support inversely predicted  membership in the adolescent-peak overt ASB trajectory (vs. low desisting), but  was unrelated to class membership for covert ASB. Furthermore, the 5-HTTLPR  genotype significantly moderated the association of parental support on overt  ASB trajectory membership. It is interesting that the pattern of Gene ×  Environment interaction differed by trajectory class: whereas short allele  carriers were more sensitive to parental support in predicting the late-onset  trajectory, the long/long genotype functioned as a potential "plasticity  genotype" for the adolescent-peak trajectory group. We discuss these preliminary  findings in the context of the differential susceptibility hypothesis and  discuss the need for future studies to integrate gene-environment interplay and  prospective longitudinal designs.

The moderating role of parenting on the relationship between psychopathy and  antisocial behavior in adolescence.	Silva TC(1), Stattin H(2).	Author information: (1)Mittuniversitetet. (2)Örebro Universitet.	We aimed to analyze the impact of several parenting factors on the relationship  between psychopathy and antisocial behavior. Nine hundred youths and their  mothers reported on parent-youth interactions, and youth self-report measures of  psychopathy, delinquency and violent behavior were taken. Multiple regression  was used to test for the significance of interactions between parenting and  psychopathy scores. In terms of delinquency, linear interactions between  psychopathy and the level of conflict with parents and parents' knowledge of  their youths' whereabouts/youths' willingness to disclose information were found  based on the data reported by the youths. Data reported by mothers indicated a  linear interaction between psychopathy and parents' knowledge/youth disclosure,  and a quadratic interaction of conflict with parents. For violence, we used  logistic regression models to analyze moderation. No interaction effects between  psychopahy scores and parenting factors were found. Youths' reports of high  conflict with parents and parents' knowledge/youth disclosure showed to have an  impact on violence regardless of the level of psychopathic traits. Implications  for the prevention and treatment are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415001121 PMID: 26651859 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Woodman AC(1), Mailick MR(2), Greenberg JS(2).	Author information: (1)University of Massachusetts-Amherst. (2)University of Wisconsin-Madison.	Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience higher rates of  psychopathology than their typically developing peers or peers with other  intellectual or developmental disabilities. Little is known about the  developmental course of psychiatric symptoms such as internalizing and  externalizing behaviors in this population. Individual characteristics and  aspects of the family environment may explain variability in outcomes for adults  with ASD. The present study extends our current understanding of psychopathology  among individuals with ASD by examining group-based trajectories of  internalizing and externalizing symptoms in adulthood. Overall, the results  showed that symptoms became less severe over time. Distinct patterns of change  in psychopathology were observed and associated with differential profiles of  psychotropic medication use, comorbid mental health diagnoses, and residential  placement. The likelihood of following each developmental trajectory was  estimated based on characteristics of the adults with ASD (gender, adaptive  behavior, and autistic symptoms) and maternal expressed emotion (criticism and  warmth). Maternal criticism and warmth were identified as key risk and  protective factors, respectively, with important implications for future  research and intervention for individuals with ASD.

Identifying the temperamental roots of children's patterns of security in the  interparental relationship.	Davies PT(1), Hentges RF(1), Sturge-Apple ML(1).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester.	Guided by emotional security theory, this study examined the temperamental  precursors of distinctive profiles of children's responses to interparental  conflict. Participants included 243 children (M = 4.6 years) and their parents  across two annual measurement occasions. Temperamental constructs of frustration  proneness, approach, positive affect, activity level, and effortful control were  assessed through multiple methods, informants, and contexts. Behavioral  observations of children's responses to interparental conflict at each wave  yielded four profiles: secure (i.e., efficiently address direct threat),  mobilizing (i.e., vigilance to potential threat and social opportunities),  dominant (i.e., directly defeat threat), and demobilizing (i.e., reduce salience  as a target of hostility). Results supported hypotheses on the distinct  constellations of temperament in predicting subsequent change in the four  security profiles.

Children of the postwar years: A two-generational multilevel risk assessment of  child psychopathology in northern Uganda.	Saile R(1), Ertl V(1), Neuner F(1), Catani C(1).	Author information: (1)Bielefeld University and Vivo International.	In postconflict settings risk factors at multiple levels of the social ecology,  including community, family, and relationship factors, potentially affect  children's mental health. In addition, intergenerational risk factors such as  guardians' history of childhood family violence, war exposure, and  psychopathology may contribute to children's psychopathological symptoms. In  this study, we aimed to identify risk constellations that predict child  internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, depression, and posttraumatic  stress symptoms in the postconflict setting of northern Uganda. In a  cross-sectional epidemiological study, 513 second-grade students and their  female guardians were interviewed using standardized clinical questionnaires. A  higher exposure to traumatic events, more witnessed or experienced violence  within the family, and lower child-reported care from female guardians  independently predicted psychopathological symptoms in children. While  controlling for intergenerational risk factors in female guardians, serial  mediation modeling revealed that the effect of trauma exposure on children's  psychopathological symptoms was partially mediated by higher exposure to family  violence and lower child-perceived care from female guardians. The mediation  appeared to be stronger for children's depression symptoms and internalizing and  externalizing behavior problems than for posttraumatic stress symptoms. The  current findings support the need for targeted interventions at the individual  and family system levels that are matched to children's psychopathological  symptoms.

(3)Dartmouth College Geisel School of Medicine.	A growing body of evidence suggests that alterations of the stress response  system may be a mechanism by which childhood maltreatment alters risk for  psychopathology. FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) binds to the glucocorticoid  receptor and alters its ability to respond to stress signaling. The aim of the  present study was to examine methylation of the FKBP5 gene (FKBP5), and the role  of an FKBP5 genetic variant, in relation to childhood maltreatment in a sample  of impoverished preschool-aged children. One hundred seventy-four families  participated in this study, including 69 with child welfare documentation of  moderate to severe maltreatment in the past 6 months. The children, who ranged  in age from 3 to 5 years, were racially and ethnically diverse. Structured  record review and interviews in the home were used to assess a history of  maltreatment, other traumas, and contextual life stressors; and a composite  variable assessed the number exposures to these adversities. Methylation of two  sites in intron 7 of FKBP5 was measured via sodium bisulfite pyrosequencing.  Maltreated children had significantly lower levels of methylation at both CpG  sites (p < .05). Lifetime contextual stress exposure showed a trend for lower  levels of methylation at one of the sites, and a trend for an interaction with  the FKBP5 polymorphism. A composite adversity variable was associated with lower  levels of methylation at one of the sites as well (p < .05). FKBP5 alters  glucocorticoid receptor responsiveness, and FKBP5 gene methylation may be a  mechanism of the biobehavioral effects of adverse exposures in young children.

Child maltreatment, callous-unemotional traits, and defensive responding in  high-risk children: An investigation of emotion-modulated startle response.	Dackis MN(1), Rogosch FA(1), Cicchetti D(1).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	Child maltreatment is associated with disruptions in physiological arousal,  emotion regulation, and defensive responses to cues of threat and distress, as  well as increased risk for callous unemotional (CU) traits and externalizing  behavior. Developmental models of CU traits have focused on biological and  genetic risk factors that contribute to hypoarousal and antisocial behavior, but  have focused less on environmental influences (Blair, 2004; Daversa, 2010; Hare,  Frazell, & Cox, 1978; Krueger, 2000; Shirtcliff et al., 2009; Viding, Fontaine,  & McCrory, 2012). The aim of the present investigation was to measure the  independent and combined effects of child maltreatment and high CU traits on  emotion-modulated startle response in children. Participants consisted of 132  low-income maltreated (n = 60) and nonmaltreated (n = 72) children between 8 and  12 years old who attended a summer camp program. Acoustic startle response (ASR)  was elicited in response to a 110-dB 50-ms probe while children viewed a  slideshow of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant IAPS images. Maltreatment status  was assessed through examination of Department of Human Services records. CU  traits were measured using counselor reports from the Inventory of Callous and  Unemotional Traits (Frick, 2004), and conduct problems were measured using  counselor and child self-report. We found no significant differences in  emotion-modulated startle in the overall sample. However, significant  differences in ASR by maltreatment status, maltreatment subtype, and level of CU  traits were apparent. Results indicated differential physiological responses for  maltreated and nonmaltreated children based on CU traits, including a pathway of  hypoarousal for nonmaltreated/high CU children that differed markedly from a  more normative physiological trajectory for maltreated/high CU children.  Further, we found heightened ASR for emotionally and physically neglected  children with high CU and elevated antisocial behavior in these children.  Results provide further support for differential trajectories by which  experience and biology may influence the development of antisocial behavior in  youth and highlight potential avenues for intervention.

One  hundred eighty-six children were recruited at age 4. The presence or absence of  child maltreatment as well as the amount of crime that occurred in their  neighborhood during the previous year were determined at that time. At age 9,  the children were brought to the lab, where their physiological response to a  cognitive challenge (i.e., change in the amplitude of the respiratory sinus  arrhythmia) was assessed and DNA samples were collected for subsequent  genotyping. The results confirmed that complex Gene × Gene, Environment ×  Environment, and Gene × Environment interactions were associated with different  patterns of respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity. The implications for future  research and evidence-based intervention are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415000887 PMCID: PMC4635509 PMID: 26535938 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)University of Oregon.	Despite the commonly held belief that there is a high degree of  intergenerational continuity in maltreatment, studies to date suggest a mixed  pattern of findings. One reason for the variance in findings may be related to  the measurement approach used, which includes a range of self-report and  official indicators of maltreatment and both cross-sectional and longitudinal  designs. This study attempted to shed light on the phenomenon of  intergenerational continuity of maltreatment by examining multiple indicators of  perpetration of maltreatment in young adults and multiple risk factors across  different levels within an individual's social ecology. The sample included 166  women who had been placed in out-of-home care as adolescents (>85% had a  substantiated maltreatment incident) and followed into young adulthood, and  included three waves of adolescent data and six waves of young adult data  collected across 10 years. The participants were originally recruited during  adolescence as part of a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of  the Treatment Foster Care Oregon intervention. Analyses revealed weak to modest  associations among the three indicators of perpetration of maltreatment in young  adulthood, that is, official child welfare records, self-reported child welfare  system involvement, and self-reported maltreatment (r = .03-.51). Further,  different patterns of prediction emerged as a function of the measurement  approach. Adolescent delinquency was a significant predictor of subsequent  self-reported child welfare contact, and young adult partner risk was a  significant predictor of perpetration of maltreatment as indexed by both  official child welfare records and self-reported child welfare contact. In  addition, women who were originally assigned to the intervention condition  reported perpetrating less maltreatment during young adulthood. Implications for  measurement and interventions related to reducing the risk for intergenerational  transmission of risk are discussed.

Finlon KJ(1), Izard CE(1), Seidenfeld A(1), Johnson SR(1), Cavadel EW(1), Ewing  ES(1), Morgan JK(1).	Author information: (1)University of Delaware.	Effectiveness studies of preschool social-emotional programs are needed in  low-income, diverse populations to help promote the well-being of at-risk  children. Following an initial program efficacy study 2 years prior, 248  culturally diverse Head Start preschool children participated in the current  effectiveness trial and received either the Emotion-Based Prevention Program  (EBP) or the I Can Problem Solve (ICPS) intervention. Pre- and postdata  collection included direct child assessment, teacher report, parent interview,  and independent observations. Teachers implementing the EBP intervention  demonstrated good and consistent fidelity to the program. Overall, children in  EBP classrooms gained more emotion knowledge and displayed greater decreases in  negative emotion expressions and internalizing behaviors across the  implementation period as compared to children in ICPS classrooms. In addition,  cumulative risk, parental depressive symptoms, and classroom climate  significantly moderated treatment effects. For children experiencing more stress  or less support, EBP produced more successful outcomes than did ICPS. These  results provide evidence of EBP sustainability and program effectiveness, as did  previous findings that demonstrated EBP improvements in emotion knowledge,  regulation skills, and behavior problems replicated under unsupervised program  conditions.

The purpose of this report is to provide evidence of an association between  within-person variability in diurnal testosterone over 1 year, lifetime exposure  to violence, and the manifestation of antisocial behavior in 135 pubertal-aged  adolescents across 1 year. Adolescents' sex and lifetime history of violence  exposure moderated the association between within-person variability in diurnal  testosterone and antisocial behavior. Furthermore, sex-stratified analyses  revealed that lifetime history of exposure to violence moderated the association  between within-person variability in diurnal testosterone and antisocial  behavior in females only. This report is unique in that it illuminates sex  differences in within-person associations among exposure to violence, individual  variability in diurnal testosterone, and antisocial behavior.

Bress JN(1), Meyer A(1), Proudfit GH(1).	Author information: (1)Stony Brook University.	Feedback negativity (FN) is an event-related potential elicited by monetary  reward and loss; it is thought to relate to reward-related neural activity and  has been linked to depression in children and adults. In the current study, we  examined the stability of FN, and its relationship with depression in  adolescents, over 2 years in 45 8- to 13-year-old children. From Time 1 to Time  2, FN in response to monetary loss and in response to monetary gain showed  moderate to strong reliability (rs = .64 and .67, respectively); these  relationships remained significant even when accounting for related variables.  FN also demonstrated high within-session reliability. Moreover, the relationship  between a blunted FN and greater depression observed at Time 1 was reproduced at  Time 2, and the magnitude of FN at Time 1 predicted depressive symptomatology at  Time 2. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that FN and its  relationship with depression remain consistent over the course of development,  and that FN may prospectively predict later depressive symptomatology. The  current results suggest that FN may be suitable as a biomarker of depressive  symptoms during adolescence.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414001400 PMID: 26439074 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Socioeconomic status (SES) is relatively stable across generations, but social  policies may create opportunities for upward social mobility among disadvantaged  populations during periods of economic growth. With respect to expanded  educational opportunities that occurred in Québec (Canada) during the 1960s, we  hypothesized that children's social and academic competence would promote upward  mobility, whereas aggression and social withdrawal would have the opposite  effect. Out of 4,109 children attending low-SES schools in 1976-1978, a  representative subsample of 503 participants were followed until midadulthood.  Path analyses revealed that parents' SES predicted offspring's SES through  associations with offspring's likeability, academic competence, and educational  attainment. Interaction effects revealed individual risk factors that moderated  children's ability to take advantage of intrafamilial or extrafamilial  opportunities that could enhance their educational attainment. Highly aggressive  participants and those presenting low academic achievement were unable to gain  advantage from having highly educated parents. They reached lower educational  attainment than their less aggressive or higher achieving peers who came from a  similarly advantaged family background. Growing up with parents occupying  low-prestige jobs put withdrawn boys and outgoing girls at risk for low  educational attainment. In conclusion, social policies can raise SES across  generations, with great benefits for the most disadvantaged segments of the  population. However, children presenting with emerging psychopathology or  academic weaknesses do not benefit from these policies as much as others, and  should receive additional, targeted services.

Emergent patterns of risk for psychopathology: The influence of infant avoidance  and maternal caregiving on trajectories of social reticence.	Degnan KA(1), Hane AA(2), Henderson HA(3), Walker OL(1), Ghera MM(4), Fox NA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Maryland. (2)Williams College. (3)University of Waterloo. (4)St. John Fisher College.	The current study investigated the influential role of infant avoidance on links  between maternal caregiving behavior and trajectories at risk for  psychopathology. A sample of 153 children, selected for temperamental reactivity  to novelty, was followed from infancy through early childhood. At 9 months,  infant avoidance of fear-eliciting stimuli in the laboratory and maternal  sensitivity at home were assessed. At 36 months, maternal gentle discipline was  assessed at home. Children were repeatedly observed in the lab with an  unfamiliar peer across early childhood. A latent class growth analysis yielded  three longitudinal risk trajectories of social reticence behavior: a high-stable  trajectory, a high-decreasing trajectory, and a low-increasing trajectory. For  infants displaying greater avoidance, 9-month maternal sensitivity and 36-month  maternal gentle discipline were both positively associated with membership in  the high-stable social reticence trajectory, compared to the high-decreasing  social reticence trajectory. For infants displaying lower avoidance, maternal  sensitivity was positively associated with membership in the high-decreasing  social reticence trajectory, compared to the low-increasing trajectory. Maternal  sensitivity was positively associated with the high-stable social reticence  trajectory when maternal gentle discipline was lower. These results illustrate  the complex interplay of infant and maternal behavior in early childhood  trajectories at risk for emerging psychopathology.

Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2018 Oct;30(4):1543.	Rates of self-inflicted injury among adolescents have risen in recent years, yet  much remains to be learned about the pathophysiology of such conduct.  Self-injuring adolescents report high levels of both impulsivity and depression  behaviorally. Aberrant neural responding to incentives, particularly in striatal  and prefrontal regions, is observed among both impulsive and depressed  adolescents, and may mark common vulnerability to symptoms of anhedonia,  irritability, and low positive affectivity. To date, however, no studies have  examined associations between central nervous system reward responding and  self-injury. In the current study, self-injuring (n = 19) and control (n = 19)  adolescent females, ages 13-19 years, participated in a monetary incentive delay  task in which rewards were obtained on some trials and losses were incurred on  others. Consistent with previous findings from impulsive and depressed samples,  self-injuring adolescents exhibited less activation in both striatal and  orbitofrontal cortex regions during anticipation of reward than did controls.  Self-injuring adolescents also exhibited reduced bilateral amygdala activation  during reward anticipation. Although few studies to date have examined amygdala  activity during reward tasks, such findings are common among adults with mood  disorders and borderline personality disorder. Implications for neural models of  impulsivity, depression, heterotypic comorbidity, and development of both  self-injury and borderline personality traits are discussed.

Hyde LW(1).	Author information: (1)University of Michigan.	The emerging field of neurogenetics seeks to model the complex pathways from  gene to brain to behavior. This field has focused on imaging genetics techniques  that examine how variability in common genetic polymorphisms predict differences  in brain structure and function. These studies are informed by other  complimentary techniques (e.g., animal models and multimodal imaging) and have  recently begun to incorporate the environment through examination of Imaging  Gene × Environment interactions. Though neurogenetics has the potential to  inform our understanding of the development of psychopathology, there has been  little integration between principles of neurogenetics and developmental  psychopathology. The paper describes a neurogenetics and Imaging Gene ×  Environment approach and how these approaches have been usefully applied to the  study of psychopathology. Six tenets of developmental psychopathology (the  structure of phenotypes, the importance of exploring mechanisms, the conditional  nature of risk, the complexity of multilevel pathways, the role of development,  and the importance of who is studied) are identified, and how these principles  can further neurogenetics applications to understanding the development of  psychopathology is discussed. A major issue of this piece is how neurogenetics  and current imaging and molecular genetics approaches can be incorporated into  developmental psychopathology perspectives with a goal of providing models for  better understanding pathways from among genes, environments, the brain, and  behavior.

McCrory EJ(1), Viding E(1).	Author information: (1)University College London.	Maltreatment in childhood is associated with a significantly increased  likelihood of psychiatric disorder that endures across the life span. If  disorders emerge they tend to be more severe and less responsive to treatment.  We introduce the concept of latent vulnerability as a way of conceptualizing the  nature of this psychiatric risk. We argue that vulnerability to mental health  problems can be understood as changes in a suite of neurocognitive systems that  reflect adaptation or altered calibration to early neglectful or maltreating  environments. Altered threat processing is presented as one exemplar candidate  system. Heightened neurocognitive vigilance to threat is argued to reflect a  calibration to an early at-risk environment that becomes maladaptive (and  instantiates vulnerability) in the longer term. Other neurocognitive domains,  including reward and memory processing, represent equally promising candidates  for indexing latent vulnerability and warrant future enquiry. We suggest that  the operationalization of latent vulnerability has the potential to guide a  preventative psychiatry approach. Intervention currently occurs at two stages  when maltreatment is confirmed: first, by addressing issues of risk; and second,  by providing clinical intervention if a child meets criteria for psychiatric  disorder. We argue that indexing latent vulnerability represents a third  intervention opportunity, with the potential to target an indicated prevention  approach for the most vulnerable children, offsetting risk trajectories before  psychiatric disorders emerge.

Tucker DM(1), Poulsen C(1), Luu P(1).	Author information: (1)Electrical Geodesics, Inc., and the University of Oregon.	Research on neurobiological development is providing insight into the nature and  mechanisms of human neural plasticity. These mechanisms appear to support two  different forms of developmental learning. One form of learning could be  described as externalizing, in which neural representations are highly  responsive to environmental influences, as the child typically operates under a  mode of hedonic approach. A second form of learning supports internalizing, in  which motive control separates attention and self-regulation from the immediate  influences of the context, particularly when the child faces conditions of  avoidance and threat. The dorsal cortical networks of externalizing are  organized around dorsal limbic (cingulate, septal, lateral hypothalamic,  hippocampal, and ventral striatal) circuits. In contrast, the ventral cortical  networks of internalizing are organized around ventral limbic (anterior temporal  and orbital cortex, extended amygdala, dorsal striatal, and mediodorsal  thalamic) circuits. These dual divisions of the limbic system in turn  self-regulate their arousal levels through different brain stem and forebrain  neuromodulator projection systems, with dorsal corticolimbic networks regulated  strongly by locus coeruleus norepinephrine and brain stem raphe nucleus  serotonin projection systems, and ventral corticolimbic networks regulated by  ventral tegmental dopamine and forebrain acetylcholine projections. Because the  arousal control systems appear to regulate specific properties of neural  plasticity in development, an analysis of these systems explains differences  between externalizing and internalizing at multiple levels of neural and  psychological self-regulation. In neuroscience, the concept of critical periods  has been applied to times when experience is essential for the maturation of  sensory systems. In a more general neuropsychological analysis, certain periods  of the child's development require successful self-regulation through the  differential capacities for externalizing and internalizing.

Exploring the complexity of the childhood trait-psychopathology association:  Continuity, pathoplasty, and complication effects.	De Bolle M(1), De Clercq B(1), De Caluwé E(1), Verbeke L(1).	Author information: (1)Ghent University.	Four different models have been generally proposed as plausible etiological  explanations for the relation between personality and psychopathology, namely,  the vulnerability, complication, pathoplasty, and spectrum or continuity model.  The current study entails a joint investigation of the continuity, pathoplasty,  and complication models to explain the nature of the associations between early  maladaptive traits and psychopathology over time in 717 referred and community  children (54.4% girls), aged from 8 to 14 years. Across a 2-year time span,  maladaptive traits and psychopathology were measured at three different time  points, thereby relying on comprehensive and age-specific dimensional  operationalizations of both personality symptoms and psychopathology. The  results demonstrate overall compelling evidence for the continuity model,  finding more focused support for pathoplasty and complication effects for  particular combinations of personality symptoms and psychopathology dimensions.  As expected, the continuity associations were found to be more robust for those  personality-psychopathology associations that are conceptually closer, such as  the emotional instability/introversion-internalizing problems association and  the disagreeableness-externalizing problems association. Continuity associations  were also stronger when personality was considered from a maladaptive rather  than from a general trait perspective. The implication of the findings for the  treatment of psychopathology and personality symptoms are briefly discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415000346 PMID: 25916837 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The influence of prenatal intimate partner violence exposure on  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity and childhood internalizing and  externalizing symptoms.	Martinez-Torteya C(1), Bogat GA(2), Levendosky AA(2), von Eye A(2).	Author information: (1)DePaul University. (2)Michigan State University.	This prospective longitudinal study examines the long-term influence of intimate  partner violence (IPV) exposure in utero. We hypothesized that (a) prenatal IPV  increases risk for internalizing and externalizing problems as well as for a  profile of dysregulated cortisol reactivity, and (b) patterns of cortisol hyper-  and hyporeactivity are differentially associated with internalizing and  externalizing problems. The participants were 119 10-year-old children. Their  mothers reported their IPV experiences and distress during pregnancy. Child and  maternal reports of internalizing and externalizing problems as well as lifetime  IPV exposure were obtained. Salivary cortisol was assessed at baseline, 20 min,  and 40 min after challenge. The results partially supported our hypotheses:  Exposure to IPV during pregnancy predicted child-reported internalizing and  externalizing problems, mother ratings of child externalizing problems, and a  profile of high cortisol secretion before and after stress challenge. The  results were significant above and beyond the influence of maternal distress  during pregnancy and IPV that occurred during the child's life. In addition, a  profile of high cortisol secretion was associated with maternal reports of child  internalizing behaviors. Findings support the growing consensus that prenatal  stress can lead to lasting disruptions in adaptation and highlight the need for  more longitudinal examinations of prenatal IPV exposure.

(2)Cardiff University and MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics. (3)Cardiff University.	Stress has been shown to have a causal effect on risk for depression. We  investigated the role of cognitive ability as a moderator of the effect of  stressful life events on depressive symptoms and whether this varied by gender.  Data were analyzed in two adolescent data sets: one representative community  sample aged 11-12 years (n = 460) and one at increased familial risk of  depression aged 9-17 years (n = 335). In both data sets, a three-way interaction  was found whereby for girls, but not boys, higher cognitive ability buffered the  association between stress and greater depressive symptoms. The interaction was  replicated when the outcome was a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. This  buffering effect in girls was not attributable to coping efficacy. However, a  small proportion of the variance was accounted for by sensitivity to  environmental stressors. Results suggest that this moderating effect of  cognitive ability in girls is largely attributable to greater available  resources for cognitive operations that offer protection against stress-induced  reductions in cognitive processing and cognitive control which in turn reduces  the likelihood of depressive symptomatology.

Early life adversity and serotonin transporter gene variation interact to affect  DNA methylation of the corticotropin-releasing factor gene promoter region in  the adult rat brain.	van der Doelen RH(1), Arnoldussen IA(1), Ghareh H(1), van Och L(1), Homberg  JR(1), Kozicz T(1).	Author information: (1)Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre.	The interaction between childhood maltreatment and the serotonin transporter  (5-HTT) gene linked polymorphic region has been associated with increased risk  to develop major depression. This Gene × Environment interaction has furthermore  been linked with increased levels of anxiety and glucocorticoid release upon  exposure to stress. Both endophenotypes are regulated by the neuropeptide  corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) or hormone, which is expressed by the  paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the bed nucleus of the stria  terminalis, and the central amygdala (CeA). Therefore, we hypothesized that  altered regulation of the expression of CRF in these areas represents a major  neurobiological mechanism underlying the interaction of early life stress and  5-HTT gene variation. The programming of gene transcription by Gene ×  Environment interactions has been proposed to involve epigenetic mechanisms such  as DNA methylation. In this study, we report that early life stress and 5-HTT  genotype interact to affect DNA methylation of the Crf gene promoter in the CeA  of adult male rats. Furthermore, we found that DNA methylation of a specific  site in the Crf promoter significantly correlated with CRF mRNA levels in the  CeA. Moreover, CeA CRF mRNA levels correlated with stress coping behavior in a  learned helplessness paradigm. Together, our findings warrant further  investigation of the link of Crf promoter methylation and CRF expression in the  CeA with behavioral changes that are relevant for psychopathology.

Sasaki JY(1), Mojaverian T(2), Kim HS(2).	Author information: (1)York University. (2)University of California,Santa Barbara.	Using a genetic moderation approach, this study examines how an experimental  prime of religion impacts self-control in a social context, and whether this  effect differs depending on the genotype of an oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR)  polymorphism (rs53576). People with different genotypes of OXTR seem to have  different genetic orientations toward sociality, which may have consequences for  the way they respond to religious cues in the environment. In order to determine  whether the influence of religion priming on self-control is socially motivated,  we examine whether this effect is stronger for people who have OXTR genotypes  that should be linked to greater rather than less social sensitivity (i.e., GG  vs. AA/AG genotypes). The results showed that experimentally priming religion  increased self-control behaviors for people with GG genotypes more so than  people with AA/AG genotypes. Furthermore, this Gene × Religion interaction  emerged in a social context, when people were interacting face to face with  another person. This research integrates genetic moderation and social  psychological approaches to address a novel question about religion's influence  on self-control behavior, which has implications for coping with distress and  psychopathology. These findings also highlight the importance of the social  context for understanding genetic moderation of psychological effects.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414001321 PMID: 25640833 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Genetic differential susceptibility in literacy-delayed children: a randomized  controlled trial on emergent literacy in kindergarten.	Plak RD(1), Kegel CA(1), Bus AG(1).	Author information: (1)Leiden University.	In this randomized controlled trial, 508 5-year-old kindergarten children  participated, of whom 257 were delayed in literacy skills because they belonged  to the lowest quartile of a national standard literacy test. We tested the  hypothesis that some children are more susceptible to school-entry educational  interventions than their peers due to their genetic makeup, and thus whether the  dopamine receptor D4 gene moderated intervention effects. Children were randomly  assigned to a control condition or one of two interventions involving computer  programs tailored to the literacy needs of delayed pupils: Living Letters for  alphabetic knowledge and Living Books for text comprehension. Effects of Living  Books met the criteria of differential susceptibility. For carriers of the  dopamine receptor D4 gene seven-repeat allele (about one-third of the delayed  group), the Living Books program was an important addition to the common core  curriculum in kindergarten (effect size d = 0.56), whereas the program did not  affect the other children (d = -0.09). The same seven-repeat carriers benefited  more from Living Letters than did the noncarriers, as reflected in effect sizes  of 0.63 and 0.34, respectively, although such differences did not fulfill the  statistical criteria for differential susceptibility. The implications of  differential susceptibility for education and regarding the crucial question  "what works for whom?" are discussed.

Maternal caregiving and girls' depressive symptom and antisocial behavior  trajectories: an examination among high-risk youth.

(4)Cardiff University.	Past research has identified maternal depression and family of origin  maltreatment as precursors to adolescent depression and antisocial behavior.  Caregiving experiences have been identified as a factor that may ameliorate or  accentuate adolescent psychopathology trajectories. Using a multilevel approach  that pools the unique attributes of two geographically diverse, yet  complementary, longitudinal research designs, the present study examined the  role of maternal caregiver involvement as a factor that promotes  resilience-based trajectories related to depressive symptoms and antisocial  behaviors among adolescent girls. The first sample comprises a group of US-based  adolescent girls in foster care (n = 100; mean age = 11.50 years), each of whom  had a history of childhood maltreatment and removal from their biological  parent(s). The second sample comprises a group of UK-based adolescent girls at  high familial risk for depression (n = 145; mean age = 11.70 years), with all  girls having biological mothers who experienced recurrent depression. Analyses  examined the role of maternal caregiving on girls' trajectories of depression  and antisocial behavior, while controlling for levels of co-occurring  psychopathology at each time point. Results suggest increasing levels of  depressive symptoms for girls at familial risk for depression but decreasing  levels of depression for girls in foster care. Foster girls' antisocial behavior  also decreased over time. Maternal caregiver involvement was differentially  related to intercept and slope parameters in both samples. Results are discussed  with respect to the benefits of applying multilevel (multisample, multiple  outcome) approaches to identifying family-level factors that can reduce negative  developmental outcomes in high-risk youth.

Coping with having a depressed mother: the role of stress and coping in  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction in girls at familial risk for  major depression.	Foland-Ross LC(1), Kircanski K(1), Gotlib IH(1).	Author information: (1)Stanford University.	Having a depressed mother is one of the strongest predictors of depression in  adolescence. We investigated whether the stress of having a mother with  recurrent depression is associated with dysfunction in adolescents in the HPA  axis and whether the tendency to use involuntary coping strategies in dealing  with this stress is associated with exacerbation of dysfunction in this system.  Sixty-four never-disordered daughters of mothers with recurrent depression (high  risk) and 64 never-disordered daughters of never-disordered mothers (low risk)  completed diurnal cortisol and stress assessments. High-risk girls secreted more  diurnal cortisol than did low-risk girls. Whereas low-risk girls secreted higher  levels of cortisol with increasing stress associated with having a depressed  mother, no such relation was present in high-risk girls. Finally, in contrast to  low-risk girls, girls at familial risk for depression who more frequently used  involuntary versus voluntary coping exhibited the greatest elevations in diurnal  cortisol. These findings indicate that a tendency to utilize involuntary, as  opposed to voluntary, coping strategies in dealing with stress involving  maternal depression exacerbates already high levels of cortisol in youth at risk  for depression. Future research that examines whether interventions aimed at  increasing the use of voluntary coping strategies normalizes HPA axis  dysfunction is of interest.

Yaroslavsky I(1), Rottenberg J(2), Kovacs M(3).	Author information: (1)Cleveland State University. (2)University of South Florida. (3)University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.	Can atypical patterns of parasympathetic nervous system activity serve as  endophenotypes for depression? Using respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) as an  index of parasympathetic nervous system function, we examined this question in  two studies: one involving mothers with and without depression histories and  their offspring (at high and low risk for depression, respectively), and a  further study of adolescent sibling pairs concordant and discordant for major  depression. In both studies, subjects were exposed to sad mood induction;  subjects' RSA was monitored during rest periods and in response to the mood  induction. We used Gottesman and Gould's (2003) criteria for an endophenotype  and a priori defined "atypical" and "normative" RSA patterns (combinations of  resting RSA and RSA reactivity). We found that atypical RSA patterns (a)  predicted current depressive episodes and remission status among women with  histories of juvenile onset depression and healthy controls, (b) predicted  longitudinal trajectories of depressive symptoms among high- and low-risk young  offspring, (c) were concordant across mothers and their juvenile offspring, (d)  were more prevalent among never-depressed youth at high risk for depression than  their low-risk peers, and (e) were more concordant across adolescent sibling  pairs in which both versus only one had a history of major depression. Thus, the  results support atypical RSA patterns as an endophenotype for depression.  Possible mechanisms by which RSA patterns increase depression risk and their  genetic contributors are discussed.

Sensitizing effect of early adversity on depressive reactions to later proximal  stress: Moderation by polymorphisms in serotonin transporter and corticotropin  releasing hormone receptor genes in a 20-year longitudinal study.	Starr LR(1), Hammen C(2), Conway CC(2), Raposa E(2), Brennan PA(3).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester. (2)University of California,Los Angeles. (3)Emory University.	Previous research supports gene-environment interactions for polymorphisms in  the corticotropin hormone receptor 1 gene (CRHR1) and the serotonin transporter  gene linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) in predicting depression, but it has  rarely considered genetic influences on stress sensitization processes, whereby  early adversities (EA) increase depressive reactivity to proximal stressors  later in life. The current study tested a gene-environment-environment  interaction (G × E × E; specifically, gene-EA-proximal stress interaction) model  of depression in a 20-year longitudinal study. Participants were assessed  prospectively for EA up to age 5 and recent chronic stress and depressive  symptoms at age 20 and genotyped for CRHR1 single nucleotide polymorphism  rs110402 and 5-HTTLPR. EA predicted stronger associations between recent chronic  stress and depression, and the effect was moderated by genes. CRHR1 A alleles  and 5-HTTLPR short alleles were associated with greater stress sensitization  (i.e., greater depressive reactivity to chronic stress for those also exposed to  high levels of EA). The results are consistent with the notion that EA exposure  results in neurobiological and cognitive-emotional consequences (e.g., altered  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning), leading to emotional distress  in the face of recent stressors among those with certain genetic  characteristics, although further research is needed to explore explanatory  mechanisms.

Mothers  and fathers completed questionnaire measures of infant physical aggression,  defiance, activity level, and distress to limitations at 8, 15, and 24 months.  The developmental viability of externalizing behavior at each age studied was  suggested by several results. Physical aggression, defiance, activity level, and  distress to limitations reflected the operation of a single underlying  externalizing behavior factor. In some cases, these individual facets of  externalizing behavior became more strongly associated with one another over  time. The externalizing construct exhibited remarkable longitudinal stability,  with the stability of physical aggression and defiance increasing with age. The  externalizing behavior construct was concurrently and prospectively associated  with several factors in its nomological network (e.g., interparental conflict  and poor parental bond with the infant). Our findings suggest that externalizing  behaviors coalesce into a psychologically meaningful construct by 8 months of  infant life. Researchers who seek to chart the emergence of the externalizing  behavior construct may now need to look to earlier months.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414000923 PMID: 25212988 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Preschool executive functions, single-parent status, and school quality predict  diverging trajectories of classroom inattention in elementary school.	Sasser TR(1), Beekman CR(1), Bierman KL(1).	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University.	A sample of 356 children recruited from Head Start (58% European American, 25%  African American, and 17% Hispanic; 54% girls; M age = 4.59 years) were followed  longitudinally from prekindergarten through fifth grade. Latent profile analyses  of teacher-rated inattention from kindergarten through third grade identified  four developmental trajectories: stable low (53% of the sample), stable high  (11.3%), rising over time (16.4%), and declining over time (19.3%). Children  with stable low inattention had the best academic outcomes in fifth grade, and  children exhibiting stable high inattention had the worst, with the others in  between. Self-regulation difficulties in preschool (poor executive function  skills and elevated opposition-aggression) differentiated children with rising  versus stable low inattention. Elementary schools characterized by higher  achievement differentiated children with declining versus stable high  inattention. Boys and children from single-parent families were more likely to  remain high or rise in inattention, whereas girls and children from dual-parent  families were more likely to remain low or decline in inattention.

Mothers' electrophysiological, subjective, and observed emotional responding to  infant crying: The role of secure base script knowledge.	Groh AM(1), Roisman GI(2), Haydon KC(3), Bost K(4), McElwain N(4), Garcia L(4),  Hester C(5).	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. (2)University of Minnesota. (3)Mount Holyoke College. (4)University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. (5)Indiana University.	This study examined the extent to which secure base script knowledge-reflected  in the ability to generate narratives in which attachment-relevant events are  encountered, a clear need for assistance is communicated, competent help is  provided and accepted, and the problem is resolved-is associated with mothers'  electrophysiological, subjective, and observed emotional responses to an infant  distress vocalization. While listening to an infant crying, mothers (N = 108, M  age = 34 years) lower on secure base script knowledge exhibited smaller shifts  in relative left (vs. right) frontal EEG activation from rest, reported smaller  reductions in feelings of positive emotion from rest, and expressed greater  levels of tension. Findings indicate that lower levels of secure base script  knowledge are associated with an organization of emotional responding indicative  of a less flexible and more emotionally restricted response to infant distress.  Discussion focuses on the contribution of mothers' attachment representations to  their ability to effectively manage emotional responding to infant distress in a  manner expected to support sensitive caregiving.

Interactions among catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype, parenting, and sex  predict children's internalizing symptoms and inhibitory control: Evidence for  differential susceptibility.

(2)Virginia Commonwealth University.	We used sex, observed parenting quality at 18 months, and three variants of the  catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (Val158Met [rs4680], intron1 [rs737865], and  3'-untranslated region [rs165599]) to predict mothers' reports of inhibitory and  attentional control (assessed at 42, 54, 72, and 84 months) and internalizing  symptoms (assessed at 24, 30, 42, 48, and 54 months) in a sample of 146 children  (79 male). Although the pattern for all three variants was very similar,  Val158Met explained more variance in both outcomes than did intron1, the  3'-untranslated region, or a haplotype that combined all three  catechol-O-methyltransferase variants. In separate models, there were  significant three-way interactions among each of the variants, parenting, and  sex, predicting the intercepts of inhibitory control and internalizing symptoms.  Results suggested that Val158Met indexes plasticity, although this effect was  moderated by sex. Parenting was positively associated with inhibitory control  for methionine-methionine boys and for valine-valine/valine-methionine girls,  and was negatively associated with internalizing symptoms for  methionine-methionine boys. Using the "regions of significance" technique,  genetic differences in inhibitory control were found for children exposed to  high-quality parenting, whereas genetic differences in internalizing were found  for children exposed to low-quality parenting. These findings provide evidence  in support of testing for differential susceptibility across multiple outcomes.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414000807 PMCID: PMC4476935 PMID: 25159270 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Intervening to enhance cortisol regulation among children at risk for neglect:  Results of a randomized clinical trial.	Bernard K(1), Dozier M(2), Bick J(3), Gordon MK(2).	Author information: (1)Stony Brook University. (2)University of Delaware. (3)Boston Children's Hospital.	The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis is particularly sensitive to conditions  of maltreatment. In particular, neglected children have shown a flatter slope  with lower wake-up values relative to nonneglected children. An intervention,  the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up (ABC), was developed to enhance  biological and behavioral regulation in young children at risk for neglect. The  effectiveness of the intervention was assessed in a randomized clinical trial  for children with involvement with Child Protective Services. Following the  intervention, children receiving the ABC intervention (n = 49) showed more  typical cortisol production, with higher wake-up cortisol values and a steeper  diurnal slope, than children receiving the control intervention (n = 51). These  results suggest that the ABC intervention is effective in enhancing biological  regulation.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941400073X PMCID: PMC4523389 PMID: 25156798 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Attenuated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning predicts accelerated  pubertal development in girls 1 year later.	Saxbe DE(1), Negriff S(1), Susman EJ(2), Trickett PK(1).	Author information: (1)University of Southern California. (2)Pennsylvania State University.	Accelerated pubertal development has been linked to adverse early environments  and may heighten subsequent mental and physical health risks.  Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning has been posited as a mechanism  whereby stress may affect pubertal development, but the literature lacks  prospective tests of this mechanism. The current study assessed 277 youth (M =  10.84 years, SD = 1.14), 138 boys and 139 girls, who reported on their pubertal  development and underwent the Trier Social Stress Test for Children at baseline  and returned to the laboratory approximately 1 year later (M = 1.12 years, range  = 0.59-1.98 years). For girls, lower cortisol area under the curve (with respect  to ground) at Time 1 predicted more advanced pubertal development at Time 2,  controlling for Time 1 pubertal development. This association persisted after  additional covariates including age, body mass index, race, and maltreatment  history were introduced, and was driven by adrenal rather than gonadal  development. Cortisol was not linked to boys' subsequent pubertal development,  and no interaction by gender or by maltreatment appeared. These results suggest  that attenuated cortisol, reported in other studies of children exposed to early  adversity, may contribute to accelerated pubertal tempo in girls.

Tackett JL(1), Kushner SC(2), Herzhoff K(1), Smack AJ(1), Reardon KW(1).	Author information: (1)University of Houston. (2)University of Toronto.	Dispositional trait frameworks offer great potential to elucidate the nature and  development of psychopathology, including the construct of relational  aggression. The present study sought to explore the dispositional context of  relational aggression across three dispositional frameworks: temperament,  personality, and personality pathology. Participants comprised a large community  sample of youth, aged 6 to 18 years (N = 1,188; 51.2% female). Ratings of  children's relational aggression, temperament, personality, and personality  pathology traits were obtained through parent report (86.3% mothers). Results  showed convergence and divergence across these three dispositional frameworks.  Like other antisocial behavior subtypes, relational aggression generally showed  connections with traits reflecting negative emotionality and poor  self-regulation. Relational aggression showed stronger connections with  temperament traits than with personality traits, suggesting that temperament  frameworks may capture more relationally aggressive content. Findings at the  lower order trait level help differentiate relational aggression from other  externalizing problems by providing a more nuanced perspective (e.g., both  sociability and shyness positively predicted relational aggression). In  addition, there was little evidence of moderation of these associations by  gender, age, or age2, and findings remained robust even after controlling for  physical aggression. Results are discussed in the broader context of  conceptualizing relational aggression in an overarching  personality-psychopathology framework.

In this investigation, gene-environment-gender interaction effects in predicting  child borderline personality disorder symptomatology among maltreated and  nonmaltreated low-income children (N = 1,051) were examined. In the context of a  summer research camp, adult-, peer-, and self-report assessments of borderline  precursor indicators were obtained, as well as child self-report on the  Borderline Personality Features Scale for Children. Genetic variants of the  oxytocin receptor genotype and the FK506 binding protein 5 gene CATT haplotype  were investigated. Children who self-reported high levels of borderline  personality symptomatology were differentiated by adults, peers, and additional  self-report on indicators of emotional instability, conflictual relationships  with peers and adults, preoccupied attachment, and indicators of self-harm and  suicidal ideation. Maltreated children also were more likely to evince many of  these difficulties relative to nonmaltreated children. A series of analyses of  covariance, controlling for age and ancestrally informative markers, indicated  significant Maltreatment × Gene × Gender three-way interactions. Consideration  of the maltreatment parameters of subtype, onset, and recency expanded  understanding of variation among maltreated children. The three-way interaction  effects demonstrated differential patterns among girls and boys. Among girls,  the gene-environment interaction was more consistent with a diathesis-stress  model, whereas among boys a differential-sensitivity interaction effect was  indicated. Moreover, the genetic variants associated with greater risk for  higher borderline symptomatology, dependent on maltreatment experiences, were  opposite in girls compared to boys. The findings have important implications for  understanding variability in early predictors of borderline personality  pathology.

Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development. (2)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	Child maltreatment has been established as a risk factor for borderline  personality disorder (BPD), yet few studies consider how maltreatment influences  the development of BPD features through childhood and adolescence. Subtype,  developmental timing, and chronicity of child maltreatment were examined as  factors in the development of borderline personality features in childhood.  Children (M age = 11.30, SD = 0.94), including 314 maltreated and 285  nonmaltreated children from comparable low socioeconomic backgrounds, provided  self-reports of developmentally salient borderline personality traits.  Maltreated children had higher overall borderline feature scores, had higher  scores on each individual subscale, and were more likely to be identified as at  high risk for development of BPD through raised scores on all four subscales.  Chronicity of maltreatment predicted higher overall borderline feature scores,  and patterns of onset and recency of maltreatment significantly predicted  whether a participant would meet criteria for the high-risk group. Implications  of findings and recommendations for intervention are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414000406 PMCID: PMC4141853 PMID: 25047300 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Relational aggression and psychological control in the sibling relationship:  mediators of the association between maternal psychological control and  adolescents' emotional adjustment.	Campione-Barr N(1), Lindell AK(1), Greer KB(1), Rose AJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Missouri.	The association between mothers' psychological control and their children's  emotional adjustment problems is well documented. However, processes that may  explain this association are not well understood. The present study tested the  idea that relational aggression and psychological control within the context of  the sibling relationship may help to account for the relation between mothers'  psychological control and adolescents' internalizing symptoms. Older (M = 16.46,  SD = 1.35 years) and younger (M = 13.67, SD = 1.56 years) siblings from 101  dyads rated the psychological control they received from mothers and siblings,  and the relational aggression they received from siblings. Despite some  similarities between psychological control and relational aggression,  confirmatory factor analyses provided evidence that the two sibling processes  are distinct. Maternal psychological control was related to psychological  control and relational aggression within the sibling relationship, which were  related to adolescents' anxiety and depressed mood. In addition, sibling  relational aggression was a more powerful mediator of the relationship between  maternal psychological control and adolescent adjustment than sibling  psychological control.

Leadbeater BJ(1), Thompson K(1), Sukhawathanakul P(1).	Author information: (1)University of Victoria.	Consistent research shows that peer victimization predicts internalizing  symptoms in childhood and adolescence, but the extent to which peer  victimization and its harmful effects on mental health persists into young  adulthood is unclear. The current study describes patterns of physical and  relational victimization during and after high school, and examines concurrent  and prospective associations between internalizing symptoms (depressive and  anxious symptoms) and peer victimization (physical and relational) from  adolescence to young adulthood (ages 12-27). Data were collected from the  Victoria Healthy Youth Survey, a five-wave multicohort study conducted  biennially between 2003 and 2011 (N = 662). Physical victimization was  consistently low and stable over time. Relational victimization increased for  males after high school. Both types of victimization were associated  concurrently with internalizing symptoms across young adulthood for males and  for females. Although sex differences were important, victimization in high  school also predicted increases in internalizing problems over time.

Heightened emotional sensitivity intensifies associations between relational  aggression and victimization among girls but not boys: a longitudinal study.	Zimmer-Gembeck MJ(1), Duffy AL(1).	Author information: (1)Griffith University and Griffith Health Institute,Behavioural Basis of  Health.	Founded in the social process model, the aim of this study was to identify  whether the associations of relational aggression with concurrent and subsequent  relational victimization differed depending on early adolescents' personal  vulnerabilities and gender. The vulnerabilities of interest were  social-information processing variables that convey greater emotional  sensitivity, including rejection sensitivity, fear of negative evaluation, and  avoidance of intimacy. Participants were 358 early adolescents (176 boys, 178  girls) aged 9 to 13 years. Relational aggression and victimization were assessed  via peer nominations, whereas the three indicators of emotional sensitivity were  assessed via self-report. Overall, results revealed greater relational  aggression at Time 1 to be associated with greater relational victimization at  both Time 1 and Time 2. However, this finding was qualified by both emotional  sensitivity and gender. When considered separately, girls who were relationally  aggressive and emotionally sensitive were at increased risk of victimization at  both assessment points. In contrast, no link was found between relational  aggression and victimization for boys, although relational vulnerabilities did  have unique associations with boys' relational victimization. These findings  have implications for our understanding of relational aggression and  victimization, as well as for the development of interventions aimed at reducing  these problems.

Kawabata Y(1), Tseng WL(1), Crick NR(1).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development.	This short-term longitudinal study examined the associations between relational  and physical victimization and depressive symptoms, and the moderating role of  school-aged children's relational-interdependent self-construals in these  associations. The participants were 387 children (51.8% boys) who were in the  fifth grade (M = 10.48 years, SD = 0.55) in Taiwan and followed at two time  points (a 6-month interval) during a calendar year. A multiple-informant  approach was used where forms of peer victimization, depressive symptoms, and  relational-interdependent self-construals were assessed via peer nominations,  teacher reports, and child reports, respectively. All measures had favorable  psychometric properties. The results of a multigroup cross-lagged model  demonstrated that relational victimization (not physical victimization) was  positively predictive of subsequent depressive symptoms, and the effect was  evidenced for highly interdependent children only. The opposite link was also  significant, such that depressive symptoms predicted subsequent relational  victimization (not physical victimization) for children who exhibited low and  high levels of relational-interdependent self-construals. In contrast, physical  victimization predated a lower level of depressive symptoms for highly  interdependent children. These effects were unaffected by the gender of the  child. The findings, especially the interactive effects of relational  victimization (as a contextual factor) and relational-interdependent  self-construals (as an individual vulnerability) on depressive symptoms, are  discussed from a developmental psychopathology perspective.

Adolescents' peer experiences may have significant associations with biological  stress-response systems, adding to or reducing allostatic load. This study  examined relational victimization as a unique contributor to reactive  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses as well as friendship  quality and behavior as factors that may promote HPA recovery following a  stressor. A total of 62 adolescents (ages 12-16; 73% female) presenting with a  wide range of life stressors and adjustment difficulties completed survey  measures of peer victimization and friendship quality. Cortisol samples were  collected before and after a lab-based interpersonally themed social stressor  task to provide measures of HPA baseline, reactivity, and recovery. Following  the stressor task, adolescents discussed their performance with a close friend;  observational coding yielded measures of friends' responsiveness. Adolescents  also reported positive and negative friendship qualities. Results suggested that  higher levels of adolescents' relational victimization were associated with  blunted cortisol reactivity, even after controlling for physical forms of  victimization and other known predictors of HPA functioning (i.e., life stress  or depressive symptoms). Friendship qualities (i.e., low negative qualities) and  specific friendship behaviors (i.e., high levels of responsiveness) contributed  to greater HPA regulation; however, consistent with theories of rumination, high  friend responsiveness in the context of high levels of positive friendship  quality contributed to less cortisol recovery. Findings extend prior work on the  importance of relational victimization and dyadic peer relations as unique and  salient correlates of adaptation in adolescence.

A short-term longitudinal study during early childhood (N = 301; 155 girls; M =  44.76 months old, SD = 8.20) investigated the prospective associations between  peer victimization and aggression subtypes. Specifically, observations of  relational and physical victimization as well as teacher reports of the forms  (i.e., relational and physical) and functions (i.e., proactive and reactive) of  aggression were collected at two time points during an academic year. Within-  and between-group gender differences were examined as part of the preliminary  analyses. In order to address key study questions, both directions of effect  between peer victimization and aggression subtypes were examined. We found that  teacher-reported proactive relational aggression predicted decreases in observed  relational victimization over time, whereas reactive relational aggression  predicted increases in observed relational victimization over time. Ways in  which these and other findings extend the literature are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414000248 PMID: 25047285 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The role of language ability and self-regulation in the development of  inattentive-hyperactive behavior problems.	Petersen IT(1), Bates JE(1), Staples AD(2).	Author information: (1)Indiana University. (2)University of Virginia.	Previous research has found associations but not established mechanisms of  developmental linkage between language ability and inattentive-hyperactive (I-H)  behavior problems. The present study examined whether self-regulation mediates  the effect of language ability on later I-H behavior problems among young  children (N = 120) assessed at 30, 36, and 42 months of age. Cross-lagged panel  models tested the direction of effect between language ability and  self-regulation and longitudinal effects of language ability on later I-H  problems mediated by self-regulation. Language ability was measured by  children's scores on the receptive and expressive language subtests of the  Differential Ability Scales. Self-regulation was measured by three behavioral  tasks requiring inhibitory control. I-H problems were reported by parents and  secondary caregivers. Language ability predicted later self-regulation as  measured by all three tasks. There was no association, however, between  self-regulation and later language ability, suggesting that the direction of  effect was stronger from language ability to later self-regulation. Moreover,  the effect of language ability on later I-H behavior problems was mediated by  children's self-regulation in one of the tasks (for secondary caregivers' but  not parents' ratings). Findings suggest that language deficits may explain later  I-H behavior problems via their prediction of poorer self-regulatory skills.

Author information: (1)Harvard Medical School. (2)University of Oregon Child and Family Center.	Substance use trajectories were examined from early adolescence to young  adulthood among a diverse sample of 998 youths. Analysis of longitudinal data  from ages 12 to 24 identified distinct trajectories for alcohol, marijuana, and  tobacco use. Modeling revealed 8 alcohol, 7 marijuana, and 6 tobacco use  trajectories. Analyses assessed risk for substance use problems in early  adulthood within each trajectory, as well as overlap among alcohol, marijuana,  and tobacco use trajectories. Findings confirmed that adolescents with early-  and rapid-onset trajectories are particularly vulnerable to the development of  problematic substance use in early adulthood. However, analyses also identified  an escalating high school onset trajectory for alcohol and for marijuana use  that was equally prognostic of problem use in adulthood. Moreover, tobacco use  in early adolescence was associated with developing high-risk marijuana and  alcohol use patterns. Random assignment to the Family Check-Up intervention was  found to reduce risk for membership in the high-risk marijuana use trajectories,  suggesting that family-based approaches delivered during adolescence can prevent  escalations to problematic substance use. These findings suggest the importance  of developmental heterogeneity and equifinality in considering prevention for  alcohol and drug use.

Alongside challenges, there are familial resources that may offer  protection. As such, the current study examined the trajectories of depressive  symptoms among 204 Mexican-origin adolescent mothers (M age = 16.80, SD = 1.00)  across a 4-year period (third trimester of pregnancy, and 10, 24, and 36 months  postpartum). Further, we examined the within-person relations of two unique  sources of stress experienced during dual-cultural adaptation, acculturative and  enculturative stress, and youths' depressive symptoms; we also tested whether  adolescent mothers' perceptions of warmth from their own mothers emerged as  protective. Adolescent mothers reported a decline in depressive symptoms after  the transition to parenthood. Acculturative and enculturative stress emerged as  significant positive within-person predictors of depressive symptoms. Maternal  warmth emerged as a protective factor in the relation between enculturative  stressors and depressive symptoms; however, for acculturative stressors, the  protective effect of maternal warmth only emerged for US-born youth. Findings  illustrate the multidimensionality of stress experienced during the cultural  adaptation process and a potential mechanism for resilience among Mexican-origin  adolescent mothers.

Associations between trajectories of perceived racial discrimination and  psychological symptoms among African American adolescents.	Smith-Bynum MA(1), Lambert SF(2), English D(2), Ialongo NS(3).	Author information: (1)University of Maryland-College Park. (2)George Washington University. (3)Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.	Many African American adolescents experience racial discrimination, with adverse  consequences; however, stability and change in these experiences over time have  not been examined. We examined longitudinal patterns of perceived racial  discrimination assessed in Grades 7-10 and how these discrimination trajectories  related to patterns of change in depressive and anxious symptoms and aggressive  behaviors assessed over the same 4-year period. Growth mixture modeling  performed on a community epidemiologically defined sample of urban African  American adolescents (n = 504) revealed three trajectories of discrimination:  increasing, decreasing, and stable low. As predicted, African American boys were  more frequent targets for racial discrimination as they aged, and they were more  likely to be in the increasing group. The results of parallel process growth  mixture modeling revealed that youth in the increasing racial discrimination  group were four times more likely to be in an increasing depression trajectory  than were youth in the low stable discrimination trajectory. Though youth in the  increasing racial discrimination group were nearly twice as likely to be in the  high aggression trajectory, results were not statistically significant. These  results indicate an association between variation in the growth of perceived  racial discrimination and youth behavior and psychological well-being over the  adolescent years.

Impairments in facial affect recognition associated with autism spectrum  disorders: a meta-analysis.	Lozier LM(1), Vanmeter JW(1), Marsh AA(1).	Author information: (1)Georgetown University.	Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by social impairments,  including inappropriate responses to affective stimuli and nonverbal cues, which  may extend to poor face-emotion recognition. However, the results of empirical  studies of face-emotion recognition in individuals with ASD have yielded  inconsistent findings that occlude understanding the role of face-emotion  recognition deficits in the development of ASD. The goal of this meta-analysis  was to address three as-yet unanswered questions. Are ASDs associated with  consistent face-emotion recognition deficits? Do deficits generalize across  multiple emotional expressions or are they limited to specific emotions? Do age  or cognitive intelligence affect the magnitude of identified deficits? The  results indicate that ASDs are associated with face-emotion recognition deficits  across multiple expressions and that the magnitude of these deficits increases  with age and cannot be accounted for by intelligence. These findings suggest  that, whereas neurodevelopmental processes and social experience produce  improvements in general face-emotion recognition abilities over time during  typical development, children with ASD may experience disruptions in these  processes, which suggested distributed functional impairment in the neural  architecture that subserves face-emotion processing, an effect with downstream  developmental consequences.

The symphonic structure of childhood stress reactivity: patterns of sympathetic,  parasympathetic, and adrenocortical responses to psychological challenge.

(2)University of British Columbia. (3)University of Wisconsin-Madison. (4)University of California-San Francisco. (5)Stanford University.	Despite widespread recognition that the physiological systems underlying stress  reactivity are well coordinated at a neurobiological level, surprisingly little  empirical attention has been given to delineating precisely how the systems  actually interact with one another when confronted with stress. We examined  cross-system response proclivities in anticipation of and following standardized  laboratory challenges in 664 4- to 14-year-olds from four independent studies.  In each study, measures of stress reactivity within both the locus  coeruleus-norepinephrine system (i.e., the sympathetic and parasympathetic  branches of the autonomic nervous system) and the corticotrophin releasing  hormone system (i.e., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) were collected.  Latent profile analyses revealed six distinctive patterns that recurred across  the samples: moderate reactivity (average cross-system activation; 52%-80% of  children across samples), parasympathetic-specific reactivity (2%-36%),  anticipatory arousal (4%-9%), multisystem reactivity (7%-14%),  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis specific reactivity (6%-7%), and  underarousal (0%-2%). Groups meaningfully differed in socioeconomic status,  family adversity, and age. Results highlight the sample-level reliability of  children's neuroendocrine responses to stress and suggest important cross-system  regularities that are linked to development and prior experiences and may have  implications for subsequent physical and mental morbidity.

Investigating eye movement patterns, language, and social ability in children  with autism spectrum disorder.	Stagg SD(1), Linnell KJ(2), Heaton P(2).	Author information: (1)Anglia Ruskin University. (2)Goldsmiths, University of London.	Although all intellectually high-functioning children with autism spectrum  disorder (ASD) display core social and communication deficits, some develop  language within a normative timescale and others experience significant delays  and subsequent language impairment. Early attention to social stimuli plays an  important role in the emergence of language, and reduced attention to faces has  been documented in infants later diagnosed with ASD. We investigated the extent  to which patterns of attention to social stimuli would differentiate early and  late language onset groups. Children with ASD (mean age = 10 years) differing on  language onset timing (late/normal) and a typically developing comparison group  completed a task in which visual attention to interacting and noninteracting  human figures was mapped using eye tracking. Correlations on visual attention  data and results from tests measuring current social and language ability were  conducted. Patterns of visual attention did not distinguish typically developing  children and ASD children with normal language onset. Children with ASD and late  language onset showed significantly reduced attention to salient social stimuli.  Associations between current language ability and social attention were  observed. Delay in language onset is associated with current language skills as  well as with specific eye-tracking patterns.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414000108 PMID: 24622054 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Disinhibited social engagement in postinstitutionalized children:  differentiating normal from atypical behavior.	Lawler JM(1), Hostinar CE(1), Mliner SB(1), Gunnar MR(1).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development.	The most commonly reported socially aberrant behavior in postinstitutionalized  (PI) children is disinhibited social engagement (DSE; also known as  indiscriminate friendliness). There is no gold standard for measurement of this  phenomenon nor agreement on how to differentiate it from normative behavior. We  adopted a developmental psychopathology approach (Cicchetti, 1984) to study this  phenomenon by comparing it to normative social development and by studying its  patterns over time in 50 newly adopted PI children (16-36 months at adoption)  compared with 41 children adopted early from foster care overseas and 47  nonadopted (NA) controls. Using coded behavioral observations of the child's  interaction with an unfamiliar adult, atypical behaviors were differentiated  from normative behaviors. Principal components analysis identified two  dimensions of social disinhibition. The nonphysical social dimension (e.g.,  initiations, proximity) showed wide variation in NA children and is therefore  considered a typical form of sociability. Displays of physical contact and  intimacy were rare in NA children, suggesting that they represent an atypical  pattern of behavior. Both adopted groups demonstrated more physical DSE behavior  than NA children. There were no group differences on the nonphysical factor, and  it increased over time in all groups. Implications for understanding the  etiology of DSE and future directions are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414000054 PMCID: PMC4406408 PMID: 24621789 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Developmental or fetal programming has emerged as a major model for  understanding the early and persisting effects of prenatal exposures on the  health and development of the child and adult. We leverage the power of a  14-year prospective study to examine the persisting effects of prenatal anxiety,  a key candidate in the developmental programming model, on symptoms of  behavioral and emotional problems across five occasions of measurement from age  4 to 13 years. The study is based on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and  Children cohort, a prospective, longitudinal study of a large community sample  in the west of England (n = 7,944). Potential confounders included psychosocial  and obstetric risk, postnatal maternal mood, paternal pre- and postnatal mood,  and parenting. Results indicated that maternal prenatal anxiety predicted  persistently higher behavioral and emotional symptoms across childhood with no  diminishment of effect into adolescence. Elevated prenatal anxiety (top 15%) was  associated with a twofold increase in risk of a probable child mental disorder,  12.31% compared with 6.83%, after allowing for confounders. Results were similar  with prenatal depression. These analyses provide some of the strongest evidence  to date that prenatal maternal mood has a direct and persisting effect on her  child's psychiatric symptoms and support an in utero programming hypothesis.

Maternal parenting predicts infant biobehavioral regulation among women with a  history of childhood maltreatment.

(3)University of Michigan.	Early biobehavioral regulation, a major influence of later adaptation, develops  through dyadic interactions with caregivers. Thus, identification of maternal  characteristics that can ameliorate or exacerbate infants' innate  vulnerabilities is key for infant well-being and long-term healthy development.  The present study evaluated the influence of maternal parenting, postpartum  psychopathology, history of childhood maltreatment, and demographic risk on  infant behavioral and physiological (i.e., salivary cortisol) regulation using  the still-face paradigm. Our sample included 153 women with high rates of  childhood maltreatment experiences. Mother-infant dyads completed a multimethod  assessment at 7 months of age. Structural equation modeling showed that maternal  positive (i.e., sensitive, warm, engaged, and joyful) and negative (i.e.,  overcontrolling and hostile) behaviors during interactions were associated with  concurrent maternal depressive symptoms, single parent status, and low family  income. In turn, positive parenting predicted improved infant behavioral  regulation (i.e., positive affect and social behaviors following the stressor)  and decreased cortisol reactivity (i.e., posttask levels that were similar to or  lower than baseline cortisol). These findings suggest increased risk for those  women experiencing high levels of depressive symptoms postpartum and highlight  the importance of maternal positive interactive behaviors during the first year  for children's neurodevelopment.

(3)George Washington University. (4)University of Oregon. (5)University of Pittsburgh. (6)Yale Child Study Center.	Attention control plays an important role in the development of internalizing  symptoms in children. We explored the degree to which infants' genetic and  environmentally based risk moderated the link between attention control and  internalizing problems during toddlerhood. These associations were examined  within a prospective adoption design, enabling the disentanglement of genetic  and environmental risk for internalizing problems. Attention control in adopted  infants was observed during periods of distress at age 9 months. Birth parents'  anxiety symptoms were used as an index of genetic risk, while adoptive parents'  anxiety symptoms were used as an index of environmental risk. Adoptive mothers  and fathers reported on children's internalizing problems when children were 18  and 27 months old. Greater attention control in infancy appeared to mitigate  genetically based risk for internalizing problems during toddlerhood when  children were raised by adoptive parents who were low in anxiety. Findings  suggest that for genetically susceptible children who are raised in low-risk  environments, attention control may provide a protective factor against  developing internalizing problems across early life.

Stepp SD(1), Whalen DJ(2), Scott LN(1), Zalewski M(1), Loeber R(1), Hipwell  AE(1).	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. (2)University of Pittsburgh.	Theories of borderline personality disorder (BPD) postulate that high-risk  transactions between caregiver and child are important for the development and  maintenance of the disorder. Little empirical evidence exists regarding the  reciprocal effects of parenting on the development of BPD symptoms in  adolescence. The impact of child and caregiver characteristics on this  reciprocal relationship is also unknown. Thus, the current study examines  bidirectional effects of parenting, specifically harsh punishment practices and  caregiver low warmth, and BPD symptoms in girls aged 14-17 years based on  annual, longitudinal data from the Pittsburgh Girls Study (N = 2,451) in the  context of child and caregiver characteristics. We examined these associations  through the use of autoregressive latent trajectory models to differentiate  time-specific variations in BPD symptoms and parenting from the stable processes  that steadily influence repeated measures within an individual. The  developmental trajectories of BPD symptoms and parenting were moderately  associated, suggesting a reciprocal relationship. There was some support for  time-specific elevations in BPD symptoms predicting subsequent increases in  harsh punishment and caregiver low warmth. There was little support for  increases in harsh punishment and caregiver low warmth predicting subsequent  elevations in BPD symptoms. Child impulsivity and negative affectivity, and  caregiver psychopathology were related to parenting trajectories, while only  child characteristics predicted BPD trajectories. The results highlight the  stability of the reciprocal associations between parenting and BPD trajectories  in adolescent girls and add to our understanding of the longitudinal course of  BPD in youth.

Toth SL(1), Gravener-Davis JA(1), Guild DJ(1), Cicchetti D(1).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	It is well established that child maltreatment has significant deleterious  effects for the individual as well as for society. We briefly review research  regarding the impact of child maltreatment on the attachment relationship,  highlighting the need for relational interventions for maltreated children and  their families to effectively thwart negative developmental cascades that are so  often observed in the context of child maltreatment. Next, historical and  contemporaneous perspectives on relational interventions for individuals with  histories of child maltreatment are discussed, with attention to the empirical  evidence for and the current evidence-based status of several relationally based  interventions for child maltreatment. Differential sensitivity to the  environment is then discussed as a theoretical framework with important  implications for interventions for individuals who have been reared in  maltreating environments. Current research on neurobiology and maltreatment is  then reviewed, with an emphasis on the need for future investigations on genetic  variants, epigenetics, and the efficacy of relational interventions for  maltreated children. We conclude with a discussion of the tenets of  developmental psychopathology, their implications for relational interventions  for child maltreatment, and recommendations for advancing the development,  provision, and evaluation of relational interventions for individuals with  histories of child maltreatment.

Psychotic disorders continue to be among the most disabling and scientifically  challenging of all mental illnesses. Accumulating research findings suggest that  the etiologic processes underlying the development of these disorders are more  complex than had previously been assumed. At the same time, this complexity has  revealed a wider range of potential options for preventive intervention, both  psychosocial and biological. In part, these opportunities result from our  increased understanding of the dynamic and multifaceted nature of the  neurodevelopmental mechanisms involved in the disease process, as well as the  evidence that many of these entail processes that are malleable. In this  article, we review the burgeoning research literature on the prodrome to  psychosis, based on studies of individuals who meet clinical high risk criteria.  This literature has examined a range of factors, including cognitive, genetic,  psychosocial, and neurobiological. We then turn to a discussion of some  contemporary models of the etiology of psychosis that emphasize the prodromal  period. These models encompass the origins of vulnerability in fetal  development, as well as postnatal stress, the immune response, and  neuromaturational processes in adolescent brain development that appear to go  awry during the prodrome to psychosis. Then, informed by these  neurodevelopmental models of etiology, we turn to the application of new  research paradigms that will address critical issues in future investigations.  It is expected that these studies will play a major role in setting the stage  for clinical trials aimed at preventive intervention.

Spencer MB(1), Swanson DP(2).	Author information: (1)University of Chicago. (2)University of Rochester.	The field of developmental psychopathology has seen growth in research focusing  on interdisciplinarity and normative developmental processes, including  context-linked coping and adaptations. However, there continues to be an  uncomfortable and unarticulated perspective to view others as having culture and  "the self" as representing the standard. A call for explicit cultural  considerations in research is needed to augment the impact of these new and  other significant conceptual contributions noted. Sociopolitical influences on  social contexts relevant to the different trajectories associated with youths'  opportunities and challenges are presented. We focus on macrolevel factors that  frame contexts in which individual development occurs. A federal and educational  policy is used to illustrate how unexamined cultural traditions and patterns  embedded in research and policy impact development. These examples provide  insight in presenting issues of vulnerability, particularly for youth, and  afford opportunities to present advances and challenges paralleled in the  developmental psychopathology field.

A translational neuroscience framework for the development of socioemotional  functioning in health and psychopathology.	Wiggins JL(1), Monk CS(1).	Author information: (1)University of Michigan.	The development of socioemotional functioning is a complex process that occurs  over a protracted time period and requires coordinating affective, cognitive,  and social faculties. At many points in development, the trajectory of  socioemotional development can be deleteriously altered due to a combination of  environmental insults and individual vulnerabilities. The result can be  psychopathology. However, researchers are just beginning to understand the  neural and genetic mechanisms involved in the development of healthy and  disordered socioemotional functioning. We propose a translational developmental  neuroscience framework to understand the transactional process that results in  socioemotional functioning in both healthy and disordered populations. We then  apply this framework to healthy socioemotional development, pediatric anxiety,  pediatric depression, and autism spectrum disorder, selectively reviewing  current literature in light of the framework. Finally, we examine ways that the  framework can help to frame future directions of research on socioemotional  development and translational implications for intervention.

Ellis BJ(1), Del Giudice M(2).	Author information: (1)University of Arizona. (2)University of New Mexico.	How do exposures to stress affect biobehavioral development and, through it,  psychiatric and biomedical disorder? In the health sciences, the allostatic load  model provides a widely accepted answer to this question: stress responses,  while essential for survival, have negative long-term effects that promote  illness. Thus, the benefits of mounting repeated biological responses to threat  are traded off against costs to mental and physical health. The adaptive  calibration model, an evolutionary-developmental theory of stress-health  relations, extends this logic by conceptualizing these trade-offs as decision  nodes in allocation of resources. Each decision node influences the next in a  chain of resource allocations that become instantiated in the regulatory  parameters of stress response systems. Over development, these parameters filter  and embed information about key dimensions of environmental stress and support,  mediating the organism's openness to environmental inputs, and function to  regulate life history strategies to match those dimensions. Drawing on the  adaptive calibration model, we propose that consideration of biological fitness  trade-offs, as delineated by life history theory, is needed to more fully  explain the complex relations between developmental exposures to stress, stress  responsivity, behavioral strategies, and health. We conclude that the adaptive  calibration model and allostatic load model are only partially complementary  and, in some cases, support different approaches to intervention. In the long  run, the field may be better served by a model informed by life history theory  that addresses the adaptive role of stress response systems in regulating  alternative developmental pathways.

Thurm A(1), Manwaring SS(2), Luckenbaugh DA(1), Lord C(3), Swedo SE(1).	Author information: (1)National Institute of Mental Health. (2)University of Utah. (3)Cornell University.	The purpose of this study was to extend the literature on the ontogeny of autism  spectrum disorder (ASD) by examining early attainment and loss of specific  sociocommunicative skills in children with autism (AUT; n = 125), pervasive  developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; n = 42), nonspectrum  developmental delays (n = 46), and typical development (n = 31). The ages of  skill attainment and loss were obtained from a caregiver interview. The findings  indicated that children with AUT, PDD-NOS, and developmental delays diverged  from typically developing children in attainment of sociocommunicative skills  early in the first year of life. Loss of at least one skill was reported in a  majority of children with AUT and PDD-NOS. Significant delays in attainment of  skills were also reported in children who lost skills. The wide variation in  skill attainment and loss reported across children indicates that symptom onset  and regression may be best represented continuously, with at least some early  delay and loss present for a great majority of children with ASD.

Observed parenting behaviors interact with a polymorphism of the brain-derived  neurotrophic factor gene to predict the emergence of oppositional defiant and  callous-unemotional behaviors at age 3 years.	Willoughby MT(1), Mills-Koonce R, Propper CB, Waschbusch DA.	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.	Using the Durham Child Health and Development Study, this study (N = 171) tested  whether observed parenting behaviors in infancy (6 and 12 months) and  toddlerhood/preschool (24 and 36 months) interacted with a child polymorphism of  the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene to predict oppositional defiant  disorder (ODD) and callous-unemotional (CU) behaviors at age 3 years. Child  genotype interacted with observed harsh and intrusive (but not sensitive)  parenting to predict ODD and CU behaviors. Harsh-intrusive parenting was more  strongly associated with ODD and CU for children with a methionine allele of the  brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene. CU behaviors were uniquely predicted by  harsh-intrusive parenting in infancy, whereas ODD behaviors were predicted by  harsh-intrusive parenting in both infancy and toddlerhood/preschool. The results  are discussed from the perspective of the contributions of caregiving behaviors  as contributing to distinct aspects of early onset disruptive behavior.

The co-occurrence of child conduct problems (CPs) and callous-unemotional (CU)  traits confers risk for psychopathy. The oxytocin (OXT) system is a likely  candidate for involvement in the development of psychopathy. We tested  variations in the OXT receptor gene (OXTR) in CP children and adolescents with  varying levels of CU traits. Two samples of Caucasian children, aged 4-16 years,  who met DSM criteria for disruptive behavior problems and had no features of  autism spectrum disorder, were stratified into low versus high CU traits.  Measures were the frequencies of nine candidate OXTR polymorphisms (single  nucleotide polymorphisms). In Sample 1, high CU traits were associated with  single nucleotide polymorphism rs1042778 in the 3' untranslated region of OXTR  and the CGCT haplotype of rs2268490, rs2254298, rs237889, and rs13316193. The  association of rs1042778 was replicated in the second rural sample and held  across gender and child versus adolescent age groups. We conclude that  polymorphic variation of the OXTR characterizes children with high levels of CU  traits and CPs. The results are consistent with a hypothesized role of OXT in  the developmental antecedents of psychopathy, particularly the differential  amygdala activation model of psychopathic traits, and add genetic evidence that  high CU traits specify a distinct subgroup within CP children.

Ravizza SM(1), Solomon M, Ivry RB, Carter CS.	Author information: (1)Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA. ravizzas@msu.edu	Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are hallmark symptoms of autism  spectrum disorders (ASDs); however, it has proven difficult to understand the  mechanisms underlying these behaviors. One hypothesis suggests that RRBs are the  result of a core deficit in attention. Alternatively, abnormalities of the motor  system may constitute the central mechanism underlying RRBs, given motor  deficits observed in ASDs. In this experiment, we investigated the etiology of  RRBs and the relationship between attention and motor deficits. Movement  impairments (a) may be indirectly related to attention deficits, (b) may result  from a shared compromised process, or (c) may be independent. Twenty-two  adolescents with ASD and 20 typically developing participants performed a  spatial attention task. Movement impairments were assessed with a rhythmic  tapping task. Attentional orienting and motor control were found to be related  and supported the hypothesis that these impairments in ASD arise from a shared  process. In contrast, measures of attention switching and motor control were  found to be independent. Stereotyped behaviors, as assessed by parental ratings,  were related more to the degree of motor impairment than to deficits of  attention. These results suggest that both attentional orienting deficits and  stereotyped RRBs are related to a compromised motor system.

Emotional reactivity and the association between psychopathy-linked narcissism  and aggression in detained adolescent boys.	Muñoz Centifanti LC(1), Kimonis ER, Frick PJ, Aucoin KJ.	Author information: (1)University of Durham, Department of Psychology, UK. luna.munoz@durham.ac.uk	Different patterns of emotional reactivity characterize proactive and reactive  functions of aggressive behavior, and theory also suggests a link of both types  with narcissism. How people with narcissistic traits respond emotionally to  competitive scenarios could influence their aggressiveness. Participants were 85  adolescent boys from a detention center. Several indices of emotional  functioning were assessed, including attentional bias to negative emotional  stimuli and psychophysiological responding. In addition, we included self-report  and laboratory measures of aggression and measures of psychopathy-linked  narcissism, callous-unemotional traits, and impulsivity. Psychopathy-linked  narcissism was uniquely related to unprovoked aggression (i.e., proactive  aggression) and to heightened attention to pictures depicting others' distress.  Compared with those scoring low on narcissism, those high on narcissism, who  were the least physiologically reactive group, evinced greater proactive  aggression, whereas those showing a pattern of coactivation (i.e., sympathetic  and parasympathetic autonomic reactivity) evinced greater reactive aggression.  Results are consistent with descriptions of narcissistic individuals as being  hypervigilant to negative cues and exhibiting poor emotion regulation. These  characteristics may lead to aggressive and violent behavior aimed at maintaining  dominance over others.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412001186 PMID: 23627957 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Mapping developmental trajectories of attention and working memory in fragile X  syndrome: developmental freeze or developmental change?	Cornish K(1), Cole V, Longhi E, Karmiloff-Smith A, Scerif G.	Author information: (1)Monash University, UK.	Fragile X syndrome (FXS) has a characteristic cognitive "signature" that by late  childhood includes core weaknesses in attention and working memory (WM), but  their earlier developmental trajectories remain uncharted. Using a combined  cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal design, we tested whether early  profiles of attention and WM impairment in FXS indicate developmental freeze or  developmental change. In Study 1, 26 young boys with FXS and 55 typically  developing (TD) boys completed two experimental paradigms designed to assess  cognitive aspects of attention and WM, in addition to behavioral indices of  inattention and hyperactivity. Study 2 mapped longitudinal changes in 21  children with FXS and 21 TD children. In Study 1, significant weaknesses emerged  for boys with FXS, with no substantial improvement over chronological age.  Mapping performance against mental age level revealed delay, but it also yielded  a similar attention and WM profile to TD boys. In Study 2, longitudinal  improvements for boys with FXS paralleled those in TD children. In conclusion,  cognitive attention and WM, although delayed in FXS, reveal developmental  change, rather than "arrest." Our findings underscore the need for going beyond  cross-sectional group comparisons and gross behavioral indices to map cognitive  changes longitudinally in developmental disorders.

Bowes L(1), Maughan B, Ball H, Shakoor S, Ouellet-Morin I, Caspi A, Moffitt TE,  Arseneault L.	Author information: (1)King's College London, UK.	We investigated the antecedents and consequences of chronic victimization by  bullies across a school transition using a genetically sensitive longitudinal  design. Data were from the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study (E-Risk),  an epidemiological cohort of 2,232 children. We used mothers' and children's  reports of bullying victimization during primary school and early secondary  school. Children who experienced frequent victimization at both time points were  classed as "chronic victims" and were found to have an increased risk for mental  health problems and academic difficulties compared to children who were bullied  only in primary school, children bullied for the first time in secondary school,  and never-bullied children. Biometric analyses revealed that stability in  victimization over this period was influenced primarily by genetic and shared  environmental factors. Regression analyses showed that children's early  characteristics such as preexistent adjustment difficulties and IQ predicted  chronic versus transitory victimization. Family risk factors for chronic  victimization included socioeconomic disadvantage, low maternal warmth, and  maltreatment. Our results suggest that bullying intervention programs should  consider the role of the victims' behaviors and family background in increasing  vulnerability to chronic victimization. Our study highlights the importance of  widening antibullying interventions to include families to reduce the likelihood  of children entering a pathway toward chronic victimization.

Hyporesponsiveness to social and nonsocial sensory stimuli in children with  autism, children with developmental delays, and typically developing children.	Baranek GT(1), Watson LR, Boyd BA, Poe MD, David FJ, McGuire L.	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 27599-7122, USA.  gbaranek@med.unc.edu	This cross-sectional study seeks to (a) describe developmental correlates of  sensory hyporesponsiveness to social and nonsocial stimuli, (b) determine  whether hyporesponsiveness is generalized across contexts in children with  autism relative to controls, and (c) test the associations between  hyporesponsiveness and social communication outcomes. Three groups of children  ages 11-105 months (N = 178; autism = 63, developmental delay = 47, typical  development = 68) are given developmental and sensory measures including a  behavioral orienting task (the Sensory Processing Assessment). Lab measures are  significantly correlated with parental reports of sensory hyporesponsiveness.  Censored regression models show that hyporesponsiveness decreased across groups  with increasing mental age (MA). Group differences are significant but depend  upon two-way interactions with MA and context (social and nonsocial). At a very  young MA (e.g., 6 months), the autism group demonstrates more hyporesponsiveness  to social and nonsocial stimuli (with larger effects for social) than  developmental delay and typically developing groups, but at an older MA (e.g.,  60 months) there are no significant differences. Hyporesponsiveness to social  and nonsocial stimuli predicts lower levels of joint attention and language in  children with autism. Generalized processes in attention disengagement and  behavioral orienting may have relevance for identifying early risk factors of  autism and for facilitating learning across contexts to support the development  of joint attention and language.

Parental responsiveness moderates the association between early-life stress and  reduced telomere length.	Asok A(#)(1), Bernard K(#)(1), Roth TL(1), Rosen JB(1), Dozier M(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, 19716, USA. (#)Contributed equally	Early-life stress, such as maltreatment, institutionalization, and exposure to  violence, is associated with accelerated telomere shortening. Telomere  shortening may thus represent a biomarker of early adversity. Previous studies  have suggested that responsive parenting may protect children from the negative  biological and behavioral consequences of early adversity. This study examined  the role of parental responsiveness in buffering children from telomere  shortening following experiences of early-life stress. We found that high-risk  children had significantly shorter telomeres than low-risk children, controlling  for household income, birth weight, gender, and minority status. Further,  parental responsiveness moderated the association between risk and telomere  length, with more responsive parenting associated with longer telomeres only  among high-risk children. These findings suggest that responsive parenting may  have protective benefits on telomere shortening for young children exposed to  early-life stress. Therefore, this study has important implications for early  parenting interventions.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579413000011 PMCID: PMC4312590 PMID: 23527512 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Ohio State University, 2012 Founders Hall, 1179  University Drive, Newark, OH 43055, USA. martens.22@osu.edu	Williams syndrome is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder caused by a  hemizygous deletion on chromosome 7q11.23, resulting in atypical brain structure  and function, including abnormal morphology of the corpus callosum. An influence  of handedness on the size of the corpus callosum has been observed in studies of  typical individuals, but handedness has not been taken into account in studies  of callosal morphology in Williams syndrome. We hypothesized that callosal area  is smaller and the size of the splenium and isthmus is reduced in individuals  with Williams syndrome compared to healthy controls, and examined age, sex, and  handedness effects on corpus callosal area. Structural magnetic resonance  imaging scans were obtained on 25 individuals with Williams syndrome (18  right-handed, 7 left-handed) and 25 matched controls. We found that callosal  thickness was significantly reduced in the splenium of Williams syndrome  individuals compared to controls. We also found novel evidence that the callosal  area was smaller in left-handed participants with Williams syndrome than their  right-handed counterparts, with opposite findings observed in the control group.  This novel finding may be associated with LIM-kinase hemizygosity, a  characteristic of Williams syndrome. The findings may have significant clinical  implications in future explorations of the Williams syndrome cognitive  phenotype.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412001009 PMID: 23398763 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Boys' serotonin transporter genotype affects maternal behavior through  self-control: a case of evocative gene-environment correlation.	Pener-Tessler R(1), Avinun R, Uzefovsky F, Edelman S, Ebstein RP, Knafo A.	Author information: (1)Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem 91905, Israel.	Self-control, involving processes such as delaying gratification, concentrating,  planning, following instructions, and adapting emotions and behavior to  situational requirements and social norms, may have a profound impact on  children's adjustment. The importance of self-control suggests that parents are  likely to modify their parenting based on children's ability for self-control.  We study the effect of children's self-control, a trait partially molded by  genetics, on their mothers' parenting, a process of evocative gene-environment  correlation. Israeli 3.5-year-old twins (N = 320) participated in a lab session  in which their mothers' parenting was observed. DNA was available from most  children (N = 228). Mothers described children's self-control in a  questionnaire. Boys were lower in self-control and received less positive  parenting from their mothers, in comparison with girls. For boys, and not for  girls, the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region gene predicted  mothers' levels of positive parenting, an effect mediated by boys' self-control.  The implications of this evocative gene-environment correlation and the observed  sex differences are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941200096X PMID: 23398759 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University, 140 Moore Building,  University Park, PA 16802, USA. jenaemn@psu.edu	This study examined genetic and environmental influences on associations among  marital conflict about the child, parental monitoring, sibling relationship  negativity, and peer delinquency during adolescence and initiation of illegal  drug use by young adulthood. The sample comprised data collected longitudinally  from same-sex sibling pairs and parents when the siblings were 10-18 years old  (M = 14.5 and 12.9 years for Child 1 and Child 2, respectively) and 20-35 years  old (M = 26.8 and 25.5 years for Child 1 and Child 2, respectively). Findings  indicate four factors that explain the initiation of illegal drug use: two  shaped by genetic influences and two shaped by environments shared by siblings.  The two genetically shaped factors probably have distinct mechanisms: one a  child-initiated coercive process in the family and the other parent and peer  processes shaped by the child's disclosure. The environmentally influenced  factors seem distinctively shaped by poor parental monitoring of both sibs and  the effects of siblings on each other's deviancy.

Author information: (1)University of Cambridge, Douglas House, 18b Trumpington Road, Cambridge CB2  8AH, United Kingdom. pow12@cam.ac.uk	Depression is known to be associated with a wide array of environmental factors.  Such associations are due at least in part to genetic influences on both. This  issue has been little explored with preadolescent children. Measures of family  chaos and parenting style at age 9 and child depressive symptoms at age 12 were  completed by 3,258 twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study and their  parents. Quantitative genetic modeling was used to explore common and unique  genetic and environmental influences on both family environment and later  depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms at age 12 were significantly heritable.  Moderate genetic effects influenced parenting style and family chaos at the age  of 9, indicating gene-environment correlation. There were significant genetic  correlations between family environment and depressive symptoms. There was some  evidence of a Gene × Environment interaction, with stronger genetic effects on  depressive symptoms for children with more suboptimal family environment. There  was an Environment × Environment interaction, with effects of nonshared  environment on depressive symptoms stronger for twins with more adverse  parenting experiences. There is some evidence for gene-environment correlation  between aspects of family environment in middle childhood and subsequent  depressive symptoms. This suggests that one of the mechanisms by which genes  lead to depressive symptoms may be by themselves influencing depressogenic  environments.

Jaffee SR(1), Lombardi CM, Coley RL.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, 3720 Walnut Street,  Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. srjaffee@psych.upenn.edu	Married men engage in significantly less antisocial behavior than unmarried men,  but it is not clear whether this reflects a causal relationship. Instead, the  relationship could reflect selection into marriage whereby the men who are most  likely to marry (men in steady employment with high levels of education) are the  least likely to engage in antisocial behavior. The relationship could also be  the result of reverse causation, whereby high levels of antisocial behavior are  a deterrent to marriage rather than the reverse. Both of these alternative  processes are consistent with the possibility that some men have a genetically  based proclivity to become married, known as an active genotype-environment  correlation. Using four complementary methods, we tested the hypothesis that  marriage limits men's antisocial behavior. These approaches have different  strengths and weaknesses and collectively help to rule out alternative  explanations, including active genotype-environment correlations, for a causal  association between marriage and men's antisocial behavior. Data were drawn from  the in-home interview sample of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent  Health, a large, longitudinal survey study of a nationally representative sample  of adolescents in the United States. Lagged negative binomial and logistic  regression and propensity score matching models (n = 2,250), fixed-effects  models of within-individual change (n = 3,061), and random-effects models of  sibling differences (n = 618) all showed that married men engaged in  significantly less antisocial behavior than unmarried men. Our findings  replicate results from other quasiexperimental studies of marriage and men's  antisocial behavior and extend the results to a nationally representative sample  of young adults in the United States.

Author information: (1)Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University  College London, 26 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AP, UK. f.rice@ucl.ac.uk	Parental depression is associated with disruptions in the parent-child  relationship, exposure to stressful family life events, and offspring depressive  symptoms. Evidence suggests that intergenerational transmission of depression  involves environmental and inherited contributions. We sought to evaluate the  role of passive gene-environment correlation (rGE) in relation to depression,  family life events that were due to parental behavior, and parental positivity  in a sample where children varied in genetic relatedness to their rearing  parents. Our study included 865 families with children born through assisted  conception (444 related to both parents, 210 related to the mother only, 175  related to the father only, and 36 related to neither parent). Consistent with  previous studies, the intergenerational transmission of depressive symptoms was  largely due to environmental factors, although parent and child gender  influenced results. Maternal and paternal depressive symptoms were associated  with reduced positivity and increased parentally imposed life events regardless  of parent-child relatedness. Results of path analysis were consistent with  passive rGE for both maternal and paternal positivity in that positivity  partially mediated the link between maternal/paternal depression and child  depression only in genetically related parent-child pairs. Results also  suggested passive rGE involving parentally imposed life events for mothers and  fathers although passive rGE effects were smaller than for positivity.

Modern research acknowledges that psychopathology and individual differences in  normal development are the joint products of both biological and social  influences. Although there have been numerous publications on Gene × Environment  interactions in the past decade, gene-environment correlation is another  important form of gene-environment interplay that has received less attention.  This Special Section demonstrates, using a range of methodological approaches,  the importance of gene-environment correlation in developmental psychopathology.  Several types of gene-environment correlation are described, including passive,  evocative, and active. Other studies highlight the potential for  gene-environment correlation to obscure associations between risk exposures and  child psychopathology. Future directions for gene-environment correlation  research are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412000855 PMID: 23398748 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Interparental conflict, parent psychopathology, hostile parenting, and child  antisocial behavior: examining the role of maternal versus paternal influences  using a novel genetically sensitive research design.	Harold GT(1), Elam KK, Lewis G, Rice F, Thapar A.	Author information: (1)School of Psychology, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK. gth9@le.ac.uk	Past research has linked interparental conflict, parent psychopathology, hostile  parenting, and externalizing behavior problems in childhood. However, few  studies have examined these relationships while simultaneously allowing the  contribution of common genetic factors underlying associations between family-  and parent-level variables on child psychopathology to be controlled. Using the  attributes of a genetically sensitive in vitro fertilization research design,  the present study examined associations among interparental conflict, parents'  antisocial behavior problems, parents' anxiety symptoms, and hostile parenting  on children's antisocial behavior problems among genetically related and  genetically unrelated mother-child and father-child groupings. Path analyses  revealed that for genetically related mothers, interparental conflict and  maternal antisocial behavior indirectly influenced child antisocial behavior  through mother-to-child hostility. For genetically unrelated mothers, effects  were apparent only for maternal antisocial behavior on child antisocial behavior  through mother-to-child hostility. For both genetically related and genetically  unrelated fathers and children, interparental conflict and paternal antisocial  behavior influenced child antisocial behavior through father-to-child hostility.  Effects of parental anxiety symptoms on child antisocial behavior were apparent  only for genetically related mothers and children. Results are discussed with  respect to the relative role of passive genotype-environment correlation as a  possible confounding factor underlying family process influences on childhood  psychopathology.

Vrieze SI(1), Iacono WG, McGue M.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455,  USA. vrie0006@umn.edu	This article serves to outline a research paradigm to investigate main effects  and interactions of genes, environment, and development on behavior and  psychiatric illness. We provide a historical context for candidate gene studies  and genome-wide association studies, including benefits, limitations, and  expected payoffs. Using substance use and abuse as our driving example, we then  turn to the importance of etiological psychological theory in guiding genetic,  environmental, and developmental research, as well as the utility of refined  phenotypic measures, such as endophenotypes, in the pursuit of etiological  understanding and focused tests of genetic and environmental associations.  Phenotypic measurement has received considerable attention in the history of  psychology and is informed by psychometrics, whereas the environment remains  relatively poorly measured and is often confounded with genetic effects (i.e.,  gene-environment correlation). Genetically informed designs, which are no longer  limited to twin and adoption studies thanks to ever-cheaper genotyping, are  required to understand environmental influences. Finally, we outline the vast  amount of individual difference in structural genomic variation, most of which  remains to be leveraged in genetic association tests. Although the genetic data  can be massive and burdensome (tens of millions of variants per person), we  argue that improved understanding of genomic structure and function will provide  investigators with new tools to test specific a priori hypotheses derived from  etiological psychological theory, much like current candidate gene research but  with less confusion and more payoff than candidate gene research has to date.

Author information: (1)Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.  mcgrath@pngu.mgh.harvard.edu	Despite substantial recent advancements in psychiatric genetic research,  progress in identifying the genetic basis of anxiety disorders has been limited.  We review the candidate gene and genome-wide literatures in anxiety, which have  made limited progress to date. We discuss several reasons for this hindered  progress, including small samples sizes, heterogeneity, complicated comorbidity  profiles, and blurred lines between normative and pathological anxiety. To  address many of these challenges, we suggest a developmental, multivariate  framework that can inform and enhance anxiety phenotypes for genetic research.  We review the psychiatric and genetic epidemiological evidence that supports  such a framework, including the early onset and chronic course of anxiety  disorders, shared genetic risk factors among disorders both within and across  time, and developmentally dynamic genetic influences. We propose three  strategies for developmentally sensitive phenotyping: examination of early  temperamental risk factors, use of latent factors to model underlying anxiety  liability, and use of developmental trajectories as phenotypes.

Covert antisocial behavior, peer deviancy training, parenting processes, and sex  differences in the development of antisocial behavior during childhood.	Snyder JJ(1), Schrepferman LP, Bullard L, McEachern AD, Patterson GR.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Box 34, Wichita State University, Wichita, KS  67260-0034, USA. james.snyder@wichita.edu	Two longitudinal studies were used to examine the occurrence and consequences of  peer deviancy training during childhood and the relative role of early covert  antisocial behavior in risk for antisocial behavior in early adolescence. Peer  deviancy training was apparent in a sample of at-risk first grade children, and  it showed persistence and increased prevalence across the school year. Peer  deviancy training, peer rejection, and unskilled parenting made additive  contributions to the development of antisocial behavior during kindergarten and  first grade and to antisocial behavior in fourth grade. Skilled parenting  partially mitigated the association of peer deviancy training with antisocial  behavior for boys. The appearance and growth of covert antisocial behavior was a  predictor of fourth grade antisocial for boys and girls, more so than aggressive  and overt antisocial behavior. Peer deviancy training and early covert  antisocial behavior were key pathways to girls' antisocial behavior in fourth  grade, and they complemented the roles of peer rejection and overt antisocial  behavior for boys. The relationships of parenting and peer processes to  trajectories of antisocial behavior were similar for boys and girls; but boys  showed higher levels of antisocial behavior, were more involved in peer deviancy  training, and were more likely to experience peer rejection.

Dmitrieva J(1), Monahan KC, Cauffman E, Steinberg L.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Frontier Hall, 2155 South Race Street, University  of Denver, Denver, CO 80208, USA. julia.dmitrieva@psy.du.edu	Improvements in temperance, perspective, and responsibility are a part of  typical development of psychosocial maturity during adolescence. The existing  literature suggests that the developmental course of psychosocial maturity is  influenced by normative variations in social context, but little is known about  how atypical contexts, such as incarceration, influence its development. The  study investigates how the development of psychosocial maturity is affected by  incarceration, using data from a 7-year longitudinal study of 1,171 adolescent  males. We compared the effects of confinement in juvenile facilities with  varying degrees of focus on incarceration versus rehabilitation (i.e., secure  vs. residential treatment facilities) and tested whether facility quality and  age at incarceration moderate the effect of incarceration on psychosocial  maturity. The results indicate that incarceration in a secure setting, but not a  residential treatment facility, is associated with a short-term decline in  temperance and responsibility. The total amount of time incarcerated in a  residential treatment facility, but not a secure setting, had a negative effect  on the developmental trajectory of psychosocial maturity. Age at incarceration,  but not the facility quality, moderated the effect of recent incarceration:  older youths were more susceptible to short-term negative effects of recent  incarceration in a secure setting, but they also benefited more than younger  participants from short-term positive effects of incarceration in a residential  treatment setting. Furthermore, youths who perceived their incarceration setting  as unsafe evinced a decline in temperance. Future research and policy  implications are discussed.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Florida State University, 1107 West Call Street,  Tallahassee, FL 32306-4301, USA. cpatrick@psy.fsu.edu	We propose that neuroscientific understanding of antisocial behavior can be  advanced by focusing programmatic efforts on neurobehavioral trait constructs,  that is, individual difference constructs with direct referents in neurobiology  as well as behavior. As specific examples, we highlight inhibitory control and  defensive reactivity as two such constructs with clear relevance for  understanding antisocial behavior in the context of development. Variations in  inhibitory control are theorized to reflect individual differences in the  functioning of brain systems that operate to guide and inhibit behavior and  regulate emotional response in the service of nonimmediate goals. Variations in  defensive reactivity are posited to reflect individual differences in the  sensitivity of the brain's aversive motivational (fear) system. We describe how  these constructs have been conceptualized in the adult and child literatures and  review work pertaining to traditional psychometric (rating and behaviorally  based) assessment of these constructs and their known physiological correlates  at differing ages as well as evidence linking these constructs to antisocial  behavior problems in children and adults. We outline a psychoneurometric  approach, which entails systematic development of neurobiological measures of  target trait constructs through reference to psychological phenotypes, as a  paradigm for linking clinical disorders to neurobiological systems. We provide a  concrete illustration of this approach in the domain of externalizing proneness  and discuss its broader implications for research on conduct disorder,  antisocial personality, and psychopathy.

Box 5010, Georgia State University, Atlanta,  GA 30302-5010, USA. etone@gsu.edu	This article represents an effort to extend our understanding of paranoia or  suspicion and its development by integrating findings across clinical,  developmental, and neuroscience literatures. We first define "paranoia" or  paranoid thought and examine its prevalence across typically and atypically  developing individuals and theoretical perspectives regarding its development  and maintenance. We then briefly summarize current ideas regarding the neural  correlates of adaptive, appropriately trusting interpersonal perception, social  cognition, and behavior across development. Our focus shifts subsequently to  examining in normative and atypical developmental contexts the neural correlates  of several component cognitive processes thought to contribute to paranoid  thinking: (a) attention bias for threat, (b) jumping to conclusions biases, and  (c) hostile intent attribution biases. Where possible, we also present data  regarding independent links between these cognitive processes and aggressive  behavior. By examining data regarding the behavioral and neural correlates of  varied cognitive processes that are likely components of a paranoid thinking  style, we hope to advance both theoretical and empirical research in this  domain.

Effects of divorce on Dutch boys' and girls' externalizing behavior in Gene ×  Environment perspective: diathesis stress or differential susceptibility in the  Dutch Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey study?	Nederhof E(1), Belsky J, Ormel J, Oldehinkel AJ.	Author information: (1)University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands.	Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2014 May;26(2):555.	The effects of divorce on children's behavioral development have proven to be  quite varied across studies, and most developmental and family scholars today  appreciate the great heterogeneity in divorce effects. Thus, this inquiry sought  to determine whether select dopaminergic genes previously associated with  externalizing behavior and/or found to moderate diverse environmental effects  (dopamine receptors D2 and D4, catechol-O-methyltransferase) might moderate  divorce effects on adolescent self-reported externalizing problems; and, if so,  whether evidence of gene-environment (G × E) interaction would prove consistent  with diathesis-stress or differential-susceptibility models of environmental  action. Data from the first and third wave of the Dutch Tracking Adolescents'  Individual Lives Survey (n = 1,134) revealed some evidence of G × E interaction  reflecting diathesis-stress but not differential susceptibility. It is  intriguing that some evidence pointed to "vantage sensitivity," which are  benefits accruing to those with a specific genotype when their parents remained  together, the exact opposite of diathesis-stress. The limits of this work are  considered, especially with regard to the conditions for testing differential  susceptibility, and future directions are outlined.

Author information: (1)School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Tower Building, Park Place,  Cardiff, CF10 3AT, UK. LidstoneJ@cardiff.ac.uk	Private speech (PS) and inner speech (IS) are thought to be functionally  important for children's and adults' cognition, but they have not been studied  systematically in children with specific language impairment (SLI). Participants  were 21 children with SLI (7-11 years, expressive or receptive verbal IQ ≤ 75,  nonverbal IQ ≥ 84) and 21 age- and nonverbal IQ-matched controls. Participants  completed three sets of Tower of London problems: one with no dual task (PS  condition), one with articulatory suppression, and one while foot tapping  (control condition). Participants also completed a digit span task. There was no  group difference in the susceptibility of Tower of London performance to  articulatory suppression, but the PS of the SLI group was less internalized than  that of the controls on both tasks. The findings suggest that children with SLI  experience a significant delay in the development of PS/IS, but that their PS/IS  is effective for Tower of London performance in middle childhood. Findings are  discussed with reference to the interpretation of the nonlinguistic deficits  associated with SLI, and in terms of clinical implications.

Box 842018,  Richmond, VA 23284-2018, USA. wkliewer@vcu.edu	This study examined physiological correlates (cortisol and α-amylase [AA]) of  peer victimization and aggression in a sample of 228 adolescents (45% male, 55%  female; 90% African American; M age = 14 years, SD = 1.6 years) who participated  in a longitudinal study of stress, physiology, and adjustment. Adolescents were  classified into victimization/aggression groups based on patterns with three  waves of data. At Wave 3, youth completed the Social Competence Interview (SCI),  and four saliva samples were collected prior to, during, and following the SCI.  Repeated-measures analyses of variance with victimization/aggression group as  the predictor, and physiological measures as outcomes, controlling for time of  day, pubertal status, and medication use revealed significant Group × SCI Phase  interactions for salivary AA (sAA), but not for cortisol. The results did not  differ by sex. For analyses with physical victimization/aggression, aggressive  and nonaggressive victims showed increases in sAA during the SCI, nonvictimized  aggressors showed a decrease, and the normative contrast group did not show any  change. For analyses with relational victimization/aggression, nonaggressive  victims were the only group who demonstrated sAA reactivity. Incorporating  physiological measures into peer victimization studies may give researchers and  clinicians insight into youth's behavior regulation, and help shape prevention  or intervention efforts.

Cheng Y(1), Hung AY, Decety J.	Author information: (1)National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan.	Empathy dysfunction is one of the core characteristics of youth with  callous-unemotional (CU) traits. How such a dysfunction is associated with  abnormal neural processing, however, remains to be determined. This study  combined assessment of Hare Psychopathy Checklist Youth Version, pressure pain  threshold, and event-related brain potentials elicited by the perception of  people in pain in 15 young offenders with low CU traits (LCU), 13 with high CU  traits (HCU), and 15 typically developing controls. Compared to the controls,  LCU and HCU had higher pain thresholds. Although only the central late positive  potential (LPP) was reduced in LCU, both the frontal N120 and central LPP were  diminished in HCU. When exposed to situations in which someone was harmed by  another, HCU retained the LPP, and this response was significantly correlated  with their psychopathic traits and pain thresholds. Both groups had no deficit  in sensorimotor resonance as assessed by mu suppression. These results  demonstrate that youth with HCU exhibit atypical neural dynamics of pain empathy  processing in the early stage of affective arousal, which is coupled with their  relative insensitivity to actual pain. Their capacity to understand  intentionality, however, was not affected. Such uncoupling between affective  arousal and emotion understanding may contribute to instigating aggressive  behaviors in juvenile psychopaths.

Scott WD(1), Dearing E.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Wyoming, P.O. Box 3415, Laramie, WY  82071-3415, USA. wscott@uwyo.edu	We used a 3-year cross-sequential longitudinal design to examine the relations  between self-efficacy judgments in three different domains (academic, social,  resisting negative peer influences), cultural identity, theories of  intelligence, and depressive symptoms. One hundred ninety-eight American Indian  youths participated in the study, who all attended a middle school on a  reservation in the northern plains of the United States. We conducted multilevel  models to examine both between- and within-person associations as well as to  investigate lagged within-youth associations. We found that not only did youths  with relatively high self-efficacy have lower depressive symptom levels than  other youths, but also increases in efficacy beliefs for academic, social, and  for resisting negative peer influences predicted decreases in depressive  symptoms within youths, even after controlling for previous levels of depressive  symptoms as well as both contemporaneous and previous academic achievement.  Neither cultural identity nor theories of intelligence moderated the  relationship between self-efficacy and depression. As the first evidence that  within-youth improvements in self-efficacy has developmental benefits, our  findings help fill a long empty niche in the line of studies investigating the  impact of efficacy beliefs on depressive symptoms.

Author information: (1)Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, University of  California, Los Angeles, 300 UCLA Medical Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095-6968,  USA. keithn@ucla.edu	Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are increasingly accepted as core features  of this disorder that play a role as vulnerability indicators, as enduring  abnormalities during clinical remission, and as critical rate-limiting factors  in functional recovery. This article demonstrates the lasting influence of  Norman Garmezy through his impact on one graduate student and then through his  later collaborative research with colleagues. The promise of core cognitive  deficits as vulnerability indicators or endophenotypes was demonstrated in  research with children born to a parent with schizophrenia as well as with  biological parents and siblings of individuals with schizophrenia. In studies of  patients with a recent onset of schizophrenia, cognitive deficits were found to  endure across psychotic and clinically remitted periods and to have a strong  predictive influence on likelihood of returning successfully to work or school.  Converging lines of evidence for the enduring core role of cognitive deficit in  schizophrenia have led in recent years to a burgeoning interest in developing  new interventions that target cognition as a means of improving functional  recovery in this disorder.

Author information: (1)Teachers College, Columbia University, Box 133, 525West 120th Street, New  York, NY 10027, USA. Luthar@tc.edu	Building upon prior findings of elevated problems among East Coast suburban  youth through the 11th grade, this study establishes disproportionately high  incidence of maladjustment across three disparate samples: East Coast Suburban  youth at the end of their senior year in high school, and 11th and 12th graders  in (a) a Northwest suburb and (b) an East Coast city. Both East Coast samples  showed pronounced elevations in substance use, whereas the Northwest suburban  sample showed marked vulnerability in serious internalizing and externalizing  symptoms. Across all samples, parents' low perceived containment for substance  use (lax repercussions on discovering use) was a major vulnerability factor,  followed by parents' knowledge of their teens' activities. Overall, adolescents'  symptom levels were more strongly related to their relationships with mothers  than with fathers. An exception was boys' apparent vulnerability to fathers',  but not mothers', perceived depressive symptoms. As with affluent eighth  graders, we found that "overscheduling" in extracurriculars is not a critical  vulnerability factor among these high school students. Finally, youth reports  suggested that most affluent parents do not indiscriminately bail their children  out of all problem situations (although a small subset, apparently, do). Results  are discussed along with the implications for practice and for future research.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412000089 PMCID: PMC4385271 PMID: 22559123 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, 51 East River Road,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. cicchett@umn.edu	In this investigation, gene-environment interaction effects in predicting  resilience in adaptive functioning among maltreated and nonmaltreated low-income  children (N = 595) were examined. A multicomponent index of resilient  functioning was derived and levels of resilient functioning were identified.  Variants in four genes (serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region,  corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1, dopamine receptor D4-521C/T, and  oxytocin receptor) were investigated. In a series of analyses of covariance,  child maltreatment demonstrated a strong negative main effect on children's  resilient functioning, whereas no main effects for any of the genotypes of the  respective genes were found. However, gene-environment interactions involving  genotypes of each of the respective genes and maltreatment status were obtained.  For each respective gene, among children with a specific genotype, the relative  advantage in resilient functioning of nonmaltreated compared to maltreated  children was stronger than was the case for nonmaltreated and maltreated  children with other genotypes of the respective gene. Across the four genes, a  composite of the genotypes that more strongly differentiated resilient  functioning between nonmaltreated and maltreated children provided further  evidence of genetic variations influencing resilient functioning in  nonmaltreated children, whereas genetic variation had a negligible effect on  promoting resilience among maltreated children. Additional effects were observed  for children based on the number of subtypes of maltreatment children  experienced, as well as for abuse and neglect subgroups. Finally, maltreated and  nonmaltreated children with high levels of resilience differed in their average  number of differentiating genotypes. These results suggest that differential  resilient outcomes are based on the interaction between genes and developmental  experiences.

Whereas paternal investment theory posits that  this effect is causal, it could arise from environmental or genetic confounds.  To distinguish between these competing explanations, the current authors  employed a genetically and environmentally controlled sibling design (N = 101  sister pairs; ages 18-36), which retrospectively examined the effects of  differential sibling exposure to family disruption/father absence and quality of  fathering. Consistent with a causal explanation, differences between older and  younger sisters in the effects of quality of fathering on RSB were greatest in  biologically disrupted families when there was a large age gap between the  sisters (thus maximizing differential exposure to fathers), with greater  exposure within families to higher quality fathering serving as a protective  factor against RSB. Further, variation around the lower end of fathering quality  appeared to have the most influence on RSB. In contrast, differential sibling  exposure to family disruption/father absence (irrespective of quality of  fathering) was not associated with RSB. The differential sibling-exposure design  affords a new quasi-experimental method for evaluating the causal effects of  fathers within families.

Author information: (1)Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Western Carolina University,  410 A Belk, Cullowhee, NC 28723, USA. jvaske@email.wcu.edu	Childhood neglect has been cited as a risk factor for later substance abuse and  criminal behavior. However, a large body of literature shows that a substantial  percentage of neglected and abused individuals do not go on to abuse substances  or engage in criminal behavior. The current study investigates whether a genetic  variant (serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region [5-HTTLPR]) in the  5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HTT) gene moderates the effect of childhood neglect on  alcohol use problems, marijuana use, and criminal behavior. Data from the  National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health shows that 5-HTTLPR conditions  the effect of neglect on marijuana use for females, but not for males. Findings  also reveal a significant gene-environment correlation between 5-HTTLPR and  neglect for females only. These results suggest that 5-HTTLPR is associated with  an increased risk of neglect for females, and it also increases neglected  females' risk of abusing marijuana.

The commentary opens by highlighting the contribution of the Emotional  Availability Scales (EAS) in providing developmental researchers with a  clinically sensitive and reliable assessment of the emotional quality of  caregiver-child interactions that takes into consideration their coregulated  nature. The numerous studies that have used the EAS attest to their usefulness  and to the way they balance complexity and attention to emotional nuances with  clarity. Several issues with regard to the EAS are discussed subsequently.  First, I propose that looking at patterns of the EA scales might be a way to  capture the quality of each dyad's emotional dialogue. Second, I suggest that  the description of attachment research as concerned almost exclusively with the  regulation of distress is inaccurate, in light of Ainsworth's broad assessment  of naturalistic home observations. Third, I raise the possibility that  additional specialized coding systems beyond the EAS may be needed for  predicting certain specific psychopathological outcomes (e.g., disorganized  attachment). Fourth, I propose that it is important to explore cross-culturally  the meaning of the behaviors on which the EAS focus, rather than assume  cross-cultural equivalence. Fifth and finally, I point out the importance of  placing the EAS in the context of the existing literature on early intervention  and treatment.

Author information: (1)Centre for Research in Human Development and Department of Psychology,  Concordia University, 7141 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC H4B 1R6, Canada.  dale.stack@concordia.ca	The present research examined how family psychosocial risk may be associated  with emotional availability (EA) across age and time in two longitudinal,  intergenerational studies with high-risk, disadvantaged mother-child dyads.  Study 1 examined dyads during preschool and middle childhood. Study 2 examined a  different sample of dyads, tested intensively at five time points (6, 12, and 18  months; preschool; and school age). Across studies, maternal childhood histories  of aggression and social withdrawal predicted negative EA (higher levels of  maternal hostility) during mother-child interactions at preschool age. In Study  1, mothers with higher levels of social withdrawal during childhood had  preschoolers who were less appropriately responsive to and involving of their  mothers during interactions. In Study 2, higher levels of observed appropriate  maternal structuring predicted child responsiveness while observed maternal  sensitivity (and structuring) predicted observed child involvement. More  maternal social support and better home environment combined with lower stress  predicted better mother-child relationship quality. Findings contribute to the  burgeoning literature on EA by focusing on a high-risk community sample across  time and generations. Results are interpreted in light of the developmental  psychopathology framework, and have implications for a broader understanding of  how EA is related to parental history and personal characteristics, as well as  ongoing family and environmental context.

We found developmental  coherence in maternal interactive behavior, and in the relations between  maternal emotional availability and children's functioning in middle childhood.  Mothers and children were observed at home and in a laboratory playroom in  infancy to assess maternal interactive behavior and child attachment security.  When children were 7 years of age, dyads were observed in the lab; maternal  emotional availability was coded using the Emotional Availability Scales, and  children's disorganized and controlling attachment behavior was assessed.  Classroom teachers reported on children's behavior problems; at age 8, children  reported on their depressive symptoms. Results showed that aspects of maternal  emotional availability (sensitivity, nonhostility, nonintrusiveness  [passive/withdrawn behavior]) were associated with children's functioning in  middle childhood: (a) controlling and disorganized attachment behavior, (b)  behavior problems in school, and (c) self-reported depressive symptoms. Maternal  emotional availability in childhood was predicted by early mother-infant  relationship dysfunction (maternal hostility, disrupted communication, and  infant attachment insecurity).

We  hypothesized that training child care professionals to develop positive  relationships with children in their care would improve the quality of  center-based child care. Thirty-three professional caregiver-child pairs  participated in the intervention group and 24 professional caregiver-child pairs  were assigned to a care as usual comparison group. The intervention consisted of  an informational and a practice component with an emotional availability (EA)  coach. The infants and toddlers (ages 11 to 23 months) in the classrooms were  enrolled in the project only if they spent at least 20 hr per week in  center-based care. The measures included were (a) the EA Scales, (b) the  Attachment Q-Sort, and (c) the Classroom Interaction Scale. The intervention  group professional caregiver-child relationships showed improvements on the EA  Scales, Attachment Q-Sort, and the Classroom Interaction Scale from pre- to  posttest, compared to the comparison group, who showed some decrements over a  comparable period of time.

The construct of emotional availability (EA) refers to the capacity of a dyad to  share an emotional connection and to enjoy a mutually fulfilling and healthy  relationship. The EA Scales were designed to assess multiple components of a  relationship from the perspective of both partners. The four caregiver  components include sensitivity, structuring, nonintrusiveness, and nonhostility;  two scales measure the child's responsiveness to the caregiver and involvement  of the caregiver. We describe the EA construct and introduce the papers in this  issue, focusing on the contributions of this Special Section to a developmental  psychopathology framework.

Allostasis and the development of internalizing and externalizing problems:  changing relations with physiological systems across adolescence.	Hastings PD(1), Shirtcliff EA, Klimes-Dougan B, Allison AL, Derose L, Kendziora  KT, Usher BA, Zahn-Waxler C.	Author information: (1)University of California, Davis, Davis, CA 95618, USA. pdhastings@ucdavis.edu	Allostasis, or the maintenance of stability through physiological change, refers  to the process by which individuals adjust to the continually changing demands  that are put upon somatic activity by salient events. Bauer and colleagues  proposed that allostasis could be detected through patterns of the joint  reactivity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis system under stressful conditions. We  examined the associations between ANS and HPA reactivity and the development of  externalizing and internalizing problems over 2 years in a sample of 215  adolescents. The interactions of ANS and HPA reactivity were contemporaneously  associated with, and longitudinally predictive of, adolescents' emotional and  behavioral problems. Adolescents with symmetrical high reactivity across systems  had more internalizing and fewer externalizing problems initially. Over time,  both symmetrical and asymmetrical reactivity predicted increasing internalizing  problems in girls, depending on the measure of ANS activity that was examined,  heart rate, or blood pressure reactivity. Implications for the understanding of  allostasis and the dynamic nature of the relations between multiple  physiological regulatory systems and adolescents' developing psychopathology are  discussed.

A developmental increase in allostatic load from ages 3 to 11 years is  associated with increased schizotypal personality at age 23 years.	Peskin M(1), Raine A, Gao Y, Venables PH, Mednick SA.	Author information: (1)University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6241, USA.  peskinf@sas.upenn.edu	Although allostatic load has been investigated in mood and anxiety disorders, no  prior study has investigated developmental change in allostatic load as a  precursor to schizotypal personality. This study employed a multilevel  developmental framework to examine whether the development of increased  allostatic load, as indicated by impaired sympathetic nervous system habituation  from ages 3 to 11 years, predisposes to schizotypal personality at age 23 years.  Electrodermal activity to six aversive tones was recorded in 995 subjects at age  3 years and again at 11 years. Habituation slopes at both ages were used to  create groups who showed a developmental increase in habituation (decreased  allostatic load), and those who showed a developmental decrease in habituation  (increased allostatic load). Children who showed a developmental increase in  allostatic load from ages 3 to 11 years had higher levels of schizotypal  personality at 23 years. A breakdown of total schizotypy scores demonstrated  specificity of findings to cognitive-perceptual features of schizotypy. Findings  are the first to document a developmental abnormality in allostasis in relation  to adult schizotypal personality. The relative failure to develop normal  habituation to repeated stressors throughout childhood is hypothesized to result  in an accumulation of allostatic load and consequently increased positive  symptom schizotypy in adulthood.

Influence of early life stress on later hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis  functioning and its covariation with mental health symptoms: a study of the  allostatic process from childhood into adolescence.	Essex MJ(1), Shirtcliff EA, Burk LR, Ruttle PL, Klein MH, Slattery MJ, Kalin NH,  Armstrong JM.	Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI  53719-1176, USA. mjessex@wisc.edu	The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a primary mechanism in the  allostatic process through which early life stress (ELS) contributes to disease.  Studies of the influence of ELS on children's HPA axis functioning have yielded  inconsistent findings. To address this issue, the present study considers  multiple types of ELS (maternal depression, paternal depression, and family  expressed anger), mental health symptoms, and two components of HPA functioning  (traitlike and epoch-specific activity) in a long-term prospective community  study of 357 children. ELS was assessed during the infancy and preschool  periods; mental health symptoms and cortisol were assessed at child ages 9, 11,  13, and 15 years. A three-level hierarchical linear model addressed questions  regarding the influences of ELS on HPA functioning and its covariation with  mental health symptoms. ELS influenced traitlike cortisol level and slope, with  both hyper- and hypoarousal evident depending on type of ELS. Further, type(s)  of ELS influenced covariation of epoch-specific HPA functioning and mental  health symptoms, with a tighter coupling of HPA alterations with symptom  severity among children exposed previously to ELS. Results highlight the  importance of examining multiple types of ELS and dynamic HPA functioning in  order to capture the allostatic process unfolding across the transition into  adolescence.

Beauchaine TP(1), Neuhaus E, Zalewski M, Crowell SE, Potapova N.	Author information: (1)Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164-4820, USA.  ted.beauchaine@wsu.edu	The term allostasis, which is defined as stability through change, has been  invoked repeatedly by developmental psychopathologists to describe long-lasting  and in some cases permanent functional alterations in  limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responding following recurrent and/or  prolonged exposure to stress. Increasingly, allostatic load models have also  been invoked to describe psychological sequelae of abuse, neglect, and other  forms of maltreatment. In contrast, neural adaptations to stress, including  those incurred by monoamine systems implicated in (a) mood and emotion  regulation, (b) behavioral approach, and (c) social affiliation and attachment,  are usually not included in models of allostasis. Rather, structural and  functional alterations in these systems, which are exquisitely sensitive to  prolonged stress exposure, are usually explained as stress mediators, neural  plasticity, and/or programming effects. Considering these mechanisms as distinct  from allostasis is somewhat artificial given overlapping functions and intricate  coregulation of monoamines and the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.  It also fractionates literatures that should be mutually informative. In this  article, we describe structural and functional alterations in serotonergic,  dopaminergic, and noradrenergic neural systems following both acute and  prolonged exposure to stress. Through increases in behavioral impulsivity, trait  anxiety, mood and emotion dysregulation, and asociality, alterations in  monoamine functioning have profound effects on personality, attachment  relationships, and the emergence of psychopathology.

Author information: (1)Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. blg4@cornell.edu	We previously used the theory of allostasis as the foundation for a model of the  current stress process. This work highlighted the core emotional systems of the  brain as the central mediator of the relationship between stress and health. In  this paper, we extend this theoretical approach to consider the role of  developmental timing. In doing so, we note that there are strong implicit models  that underlie current developmental stress research in the social and life  sciences. We endeavor to illustrate these models explicitly as we review the  evidence behind each one and discuss their implications. We then extend these  models to reflect recent findings from research in life span human neuroscience.  The result is a new set of developmental allostatic models that provide fodder  for future empirical research, as well as novel perspectives on intervention.

Author information: (1)New York University, New York, NY 10003, USA. clancy.blair@nyu.edu	This paper examined the relation of early environmental adversity associated  with poverty to child resting or basal level of cortisol in a prospective  longitudinal sample of 1135 children seen at 7, 15, 24, 35, and 48 months of  age. We found main effects for poor housing quality, African American ethnicity,  and low positive caregiving behavior in which each was uniquely associated with  an overall higher level of cortisol from age 7 to 48 months. We also found that  two aspects of the early environment in the context of poverty, adult exits from  the home and perceived economic insufficiency, were related to salivary cortisol  in a time-dependent manner. The effect for the first of these, exits from the  home, was consistent with the principle of allostatic load in which the effects  of adversity on stress physiology accumulate over time. The effect for perceived  economic insufficiency was one in which insufficiency was associated with higher  levels of cortisol in infancy but with a typical but steeper decline in cortisol  with age at subsequent time points.

Box  30.001, Groningen 9700 RB, The Netherlands. a.j.oldehinkel@med.umcg.nl	Effortful control is thought to foster adaptive action in defensive contexts and  may thereby protect individuals against anxious inhibition and focus on their  own distress. We examined if effortful control predicted adolescents' perceived  arousal, unpleasantness, and control as well as autonomic (heart rate [HR]) and  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (cortisol) responses during social stress.  The data came from a focus sample of the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives  Survey, a prospective population study of Dutch adolescents (N = 715, 50.9%  girls; mean age = 16.11, SD = 0.59), who participated in a laboratory session  including a social stress task (public speaking and mental arithmetic).  Perceived and physiological stress measures were assessed before, during, and  after the social stress task. Effortful control was measured using various  questionnaires and informants, as well as by means of a reaction time (RT) task  assessing response inhibition. Overall, adolescents with high  questionnaire-based effortful control tended to feel more relaxed, pleasant, and  in control during the laboratory session than adolescents with lower levels of  control and had stronger HR responses to the stress test. Adolescent girls with  high inhibitory control as measured by the RT task also had strong HR responses,  but inhibitory control was associated with high rather than low perceived  arousal. Our results suggest that both questionnaire and RT measures of  effortful control predict strong HR responses to challenging situations, but  associational patterns diverge with regard to perceived stress measures.

The maternal experience of stressful events during pregnancy has been associated  with a number of adverse consequences for behavioral development in offspring,  but the measurement and interpretation of prenatal stress varies among reported  studies. The Raine Study recruited 2900 pregnancies and recorded life stress  events experienced by 18 and 34 weeks' gestation along with numerous  sociodemographic data. The mother's exposure to life stress events was further  documented when the children were followed-up in conjunction with behavioral  assessments at ages 2, 5, 8, 10, and 14 years using the Child Behavior  Checklist. The maternal experience of multiple stressful events during pregnancy  was associated with subsequent behavioral problems for offspring. Independent  (e.g., death of a relative, job loss) and dependent stress events (e.g.,  financial problems, marital problems) were both significantly associated with a  greater incidence of mental health morbidity between age 2 and 14 years.  Exposure to stressful events in the first 18 weeks of pregnancy showed similar  associations with subsequent total and externalizing morbidity to events  reported at 34 weeks of gestation. These results were independent of postnatal  stress exposure. Improved support for women with chronic stress exposure during  pregnancy may improve the mental health of their offspring in later life.

Trickett PK(1), Noll JG, Putnam FW.	Author information: (1)School of Social Work, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA  90899-0411, USA. pennyt@usc.edu	This is a report on the research design and findings of a 23-year longitudinal  study of the impact of intrafamilial sexual abuse on female development. The  conceptual framework integrated concepts of psychological adjustment with theory  regarding how psychobiological factors might impact development. Participants  included 6- to 16-year-old females with substantiated sexual abuse and a  demographically similar comparison group. A cross-sequential design was used and  six assessments have taken place, with participants at median age 11 at the  first assessment and median age 25 at the sixth assessment. Mothers of  participants took part in the early assessments and offspring took part at the  sixth assessment. Results of many analyses, both within circumscribed  developmental stages and across development, indicated that sexually abused  females (on average) showed deleterious sequelae across a host of  biopsychosocial domains including: earlier onsets of puberty, cognitive  deficits, depression, dissociative symptoms, maladaptive sexual development,  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal attenuation, asymmetrical stress responses, high  rates of obesity, more major illnesses and healthcare utilization, dropping out  of high school, persistent posttraumatic stress disorder, self-mutilation,  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders diagnoses, physical and  sexual revictimization, premature deliveries, teen motherhood, drug and alcohol  abuse, and domestic violence. Offspring born to abused mothers were at increased  risk for child maltreatment and overall maldevelopment. There was also a pattern  of considerable within group variability. Based on this complex network of  findings, implications for optimal treatments are elucidated. Translational  aspects of extending observational research into clinical practice are discussed  in terms that will likely have a sustained impact on several major public health  initiatives.

Individual differences in psychopathology and adult attachment were also  explored. Participants were administered free recall and recognition tests after  hearing CSA, negative, neutral, and positive Deese-Roediger-McDermott lists. In  free recall, CSA and negative lists produced the most false memory. In sharp  contrast, for recognition, CSA lists enjoyed the highest d' scores. CSA-group  adolescents who evinced greater posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms  had higher rates of false memory compared to (a) non-CSA group adolescents with  higher PTSD symptom scores (free recall), and (b) CSA-group adolescents with  lower PTSD symptom scores (recognition). Regression analyses revealed that  individuals with higher PTSD scores and greater fearful-avoidant attachment  tendencies showed less proficient memory monitoring for CSA lists.

We describe in  detail the findings to date on research evaluating one such intervention, the  Reading, Writing, Respect, and Resolution (4Rs) Program. The 4Rs Program has led  to modest positive impacts on both classrooms and children after 1 year that  appear to cascade to more impacts in other domains of children's development  after 2 years. This research strives not only to translate research into  practice but also translate practice into research.

We expand upon previous research that focused primarily on the  contributions of academic competence and family socioeconomic status (SES) by  investigating the role of mental health in predicting adult SES. In a  longitudinal study spanning 30 years, we used structural equation modeling to  examine how parental mental health in early childhood and family SES, offspring  academic competence, and offspring mental health in adolescence relate to  occupational and educational attainment at age 30. Results were that adolescent  academic competence predicted adult educational attainment, and that educational  attainment then predicted occupational attainment. The pathways between academic  competence and occupational attainment, family SES and educational attainment,  and family SES and occupational attainment were not significant. In contrast,  adolescent mental health not only predicted educational attainment, but was also  directly related to adult occupational attainment. Finally, early maternal  mental health was associated with offspring's adult socioeconomic attainment  through its relations with adolescent academic competence and mental health.  These results highlight the importance of mental health to adult socioeconomic  attainment.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000829 PMID: 21262057 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)School of Social Work, University of Southern California, University Park  Campus, MRF, MC 0411, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA. negriff@usc.edu	This study examined exposure to peer delinquency as a mediator between pubertal  timing and self-reported delinquency longitudinally and whether this mediational  model was moderated by either gender or maltreatment experience. Data were  obtained from Time 1, 2, and 3 of a longitudinal study of maltreatment and  development. At Time 1 the sample comprised 454 children aged 9-13 years.  Analyses via structural equation modeling supported full mediation. Gender did  not moderate this mediational relationship, but maltreatment experience did. The  results show that early maturing males and females are both at risk for being  exposed to peers that may draw them into delinquent behavior. In addition, the  mechanism linking early pubertal timing to delinquency differs depending on  maltreatment experience.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, 1285 Franz  Hall, Box 951563, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1563, USA. cmasten@ucla.edu	Extensive developmental research has linked peer rejection during adolescence  with a host of psychopathological outcomes, including depression. Moreover,  recent neuroimaging research has suggested that increased activity in the  subgenual region of the anterior cingulate cortex (subACC), which has been  consistently linked with depression, is related to heightened sensitivity to  peer rejection among adolescents. The goal of the current study was to directly  test the hypothesis that adolescents' subACC responses are predictive of their  risk for future depression, by examining the relationship between subACC  activity during peer rejection and increases in depressive symptoms during the  following year. During a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, 20  13-year-olds were ostensibly excluded by peers during an online social  interaction. Participants' depressive symptoms were assessed via parental  reports at the time of the scan and 1 year later. Region of interest and  whole-brain analyses indicated that greater subACC activity during exclusion was  associated with increases in parent-reported depressive symptoms during the  following year. These findings suggest that subACC responsivity to social  exclusion may serve as a neural marker of adolescents' risk for future  depression and have implications for understanding the relationship between  sensitivity to peer rejection and the increased risk of depression that occurs  during adolescence.

Child and context characteristics in trajectories of physical and relational  victimization among early elementary school children.	Giesbrecht GF(1), Leadbeater BJ, Macdonald SW.	Author information: (1)Behavioural Research Unit, Alberta Children's Hospital, 2888 Shaganappi Trail  NW, Calgary ABT3B6A8, Canada. gerald.giesbrecht@albertahealthservices.ca	Transactional models suggest that peer victimization results from both  individual and context differences, and understanding these differences may  point to important targets for prevention and interventions that reduce  victimization. Multilevel modeling was used to examine within-person (aggression  and emotional dysregulation), between-person (sex and age), and between-school  (participation in a victimization prevention program) factors that influence  changes in physical and relational victimization over the first three years of  elementary school. Children (n = 423) reported their experiences of peer  victimization at entry into Grade 1 and at the end of Grade 1, Grade 2, and  Grade 3. On average, trajectories of both physical and relational victimization  declined. However, for individual children, teacher-rated aggression was  associated with increases in physical and relational victimization, while  emotional dysregulation was associated with attenuation of longitudinal declines  in physical victimization and increases in relational victimization. Individual  differences in sex and age at entry into Grade 1 did not significantly influence  victimization trajectories over Grades 1 to 3. Children who participated in the  WITS® victimization prevention program showed significant declines in physical  and relational victimization. Levels of victimization among nonparticipants  remained stable. Implications of child and context characteristics for  preventing peer victimization in elementary school are discussed.

Reciprocal relations between parents' physical discipline and children's  externalizing behavior during middle childhood and adolescence.	Lansford JE(1), Criss MM, Laird RD, Shaw DS, Pettit GS, Bates JE, Dodge KA.	Author information: (1)Center for Child and Family Policy, Duke University, Box 90545, Durham, NC  27708, USA. lansford@duke.edu	Using data from two long-term longitudinal projects, we investigated reciprocal  relations between maternal reports of physical discipline and teacher and  self-ratings of child externalizing behavior, accounting for continuity in both  discipline and externalizing over time. In Study 1, which followed a community  sample of 562 boys and girls from age 6 to 9, high levels of physical discipline  in a given year predicted high levels of externalizing behavior in the next  year, and externalizing behavior in a given year predicted high levels of  physical discipline in the next year. In Study 2, which followed an independent  sample of 290 lower income, higher risk boys from age 10 to 15, mother-reported  physical discipline in a given year predicted child ratings of antisocial  behavior in the next year, but child antisocial behavior in a given year did not  predict parents' use of physical discipline in the next year. In neither sample  was there evidence that associations between physical discipline and child  externalizing changed as the child aged, and findings were not moderated by  gender, race, socioeconomic status, or the severity of the physical discipline.  Implications for the reciprocal nature of the socialization process and the  risks associated with physical discipline are discussed.

Author information: (1)Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health,  University of South Florida, 13201 Bruce B. Downs, MDC 56, Tampa, FL33612, USA.  gdagne@health.usf.edu	The relationship of maternal hostile and depressive moods to children's  downregulation of unprovoked anger and sadness/fear was assessed in a community  sample of 267 5-year-old boys and girls. The speed of children's downregulation  of unprovoked anger and sadness/fear was based on real-time observations during  mother-child interaction. The association of downregulation with maternal mood  was estimated using Bayesian event history analysis. As mothers reported higher  depressive mood, both boys and girls were faster to downregulate anger displays  as those displays accumulated during mother child interaction. The speed of  boys' downregulation of anger and of sadness/fear was not associated with  maternal hostile mood. As mothers reported more hostile mood, girls were faster  to downregulate displays of sadness/fear, but the speed of this downregulation  slowed as those displays accumulated during ongoing mother-child interaction.  These associations of child downregulation and maternal mood were observed after  controlling for child adjustment. The data suggest frequent exposure to  different negative maternal moods affect children's expression and regulation of  emotions in relatively specific ways, conditional on the type of maternal mood,  the type of child emotion, and child gender.

Rodrigo MJ(1), León I, Quiñones I, Lage A, Byrne S, Bobes MA.	Author information: (1)Facultad de Psicología, Campus de Guajara, Universidad de La Laguna,  Tenerife, Spain. mjrodri@ull.es	This investigation examined the neural and personality correlates of processing  infant facial expressions in mothers with substantiated neglect of a child under  5 years old. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 14 neglectful  and 14 control mothers as they viewed and categorized pictures of infant cries,  laughs, and neutral faces. Maternal self-reports of anhedonia and empathy were  also completed. Early (negative occipitotemporal component peaking at around 170  ms on the scalp [N170] and positive electrical potential peaking at about 200 ms  [P200]) and late positive potential (LPP) components were selected. Both groups  of mothers showed behavioral discrimination between the different facial  expressions via reaction time and accuracy measures. Neglectful mothers did not  exhibit increased N170 amplitude at temporal leads in response to viewing crying  versus laughing and neutral expressions compared to control mothers. Both groups  had greater P200 and LPP amplitudes at centroparietal leads in response to  viewing crying versus neutral facial expressions. However, neglectful mothers  displayed an overall attenuated brain response in LPP that was related to their  higher scores in social anhedonia but not to their empathy scores. The ERP data  suggest that the brain's failures in the early differentiation of cry stimuli  and in the sustained processing of infant expressions related to social  anhedonia may underlie the insensitive responding in neglectful mothers. The  implications of these results for the design and evaluation of preventive  interventions are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000714 PMID: 21262046 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Cassidy J(1), Woodhouse SS, Sherman LJ, Stupica B, Lejuez CW.	Author information: (1)Psychology Department, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA.  jcassidy@psyc.umd.edu	This randomized controlled trial examined (a) the efficacy of a brief  intervention designed to increase the rate of secure infant attachment, (b) the  differential susceptibility hypothesis, and (c) whether maternal attachment  styles moderated the expected Treatment x Irritability interaction in predicting  infant attachment outcomes. Although there was no main effect of treatment, a  significant Treatment x Irritability interaction revealed intervention effects  for the highly irritable infants only, thus supporting one of two predictions of  the differential susceptibility hypothesis: highly irritable infants would have  disproportionately better outcomes than moderately irritable infants in better  conditions (i.e., with intervention). When separate analyses were conducted with  maternal attachment styles, we found significant three-way interactions among  treatment, irritability, and each of the examined maternal attachment style  dimensions (i.e., secure-fearful and dismissing-preoccupied). Specifically, with  more secure mothers, beneficial effects of intervention emerged for highly  irritable infants. For more dismissing mothers, the results revealed support for  both predictions of the differential susceptibility hypothesis: highly irritable  infants, compared to moderately irritable infants, were both more likely to be  secure with intervention and less likely to be secure when in the control group.  It is interesting that, for more preoccupied mothers, a treatment effect emerged  only for moderately irritable infants. We discuss the implications of these  findings for the differential susceptibility hypothesis as well as for early  intervention.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000696 PMID: 21262044 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Reported early family environment covaries with menarcheal age as a function of  polymorphic variation in estrogen receptor-α.	Manuck SB(1), Craig AE, Flory JD, Halder I, Ferrell RE.	Author information: (1)Behavioral Physiology Laboratory, University of Pittsburgh, 506 OEH, 4015  O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA. manuck@pitt.edu	Age at menarche, a sentinel index of pubertal maturation, was examined in  relation to early family relationships (conflict, cohesion) and polymorphic  variation in the gene encoding estrogen receptor-α (ESR1) in a midlife sample of  455 European American women. Consistent with prior literature, women who  reported being raised in families characterized by close interpersonal  relationships and little conflict tended to reach menarche at a later age than  participants reared in families lacking cohesion and prone to discord. Moreover,  this association was moderated by ESR1 variation, such that quality of the  family environment covaried positively with menarcheal age among participants  homozygous for minor alleles of the two ESR1 polymorphisms studied here  (rs9304799, rs2234693), but not among women of other ESR1 genotypes. In  addition, (a) family relationship variables were unrelated to ESR1 variation,  and (b) genotype-dependent effects of childhood environment on age at menarche  could not be accounted for by personality traits elsewhere shown to explain  heritable variation in reported family conflict and cohesion. These findings are  consistent with theories of differential susceptibility to environmental  influence, as well as the more specific hypothesis (by Belsky) that girls differ  genetically in their sensitivity to rearing effects on pubertal maturation.

Author information: (1)Institute for the Study of Children, Families and Social Issues, Birkbeck  University of London, UK.	Evidence indicates that maternal prenatal distress predicts problematic health  and behavioral outcomes in children as well as infant/child cortisol levels and  negative emotionality as reviewed here. Evidence that these physiological and  behavioral characteristics themselves moderate environmental effects on  development in a "for better and for worse" manner consistent with Belsky's  differential susceptibility hypothesis and Boyce and Ellis' notions of  biological sensitivity to context raises the prospect that susceptibility to  rearing is a function of nurture (i.e., fetal environment), consistent with  Boyce and Ellis' proposal that plasticity can be shaped by developmental  experience. This hypothesis is supported by new findings from the National  Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and  Youth Development showing that low birth weight, a marker for an adverse  prenatal environment, predicts infant difficult temperament, which is a  susceptibility factor that we previously showed as moderating, in a for better  and for worse manner, the effects of parenting and child care quality on  socioemotional functioning. Moreover, recent Gene × Environment interaction  research raises the prospect that some fetuses may be more susceptible to such  "prenatal programming of postnatal plasticity" as a result of their genetic  makeup. If this proves true, it will be consistent with the conclusion that  early developmental plasticity is a function of both nature and nurture and may  be evolutionarily adaptive, a further possibility considered in the discussion.

Lenzenweger MF(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, State University of New York at Binghamton, Science  IV, Binghamton, NY 13902-6000, USA. mlenzen@binghamton.edu	It is argued that personality pathology represents the final emergent product of  a complex interaction of underlying neurobehavioral systems as well as  environment inputs. A number of factors may be involved in the developmental  pathway and a cascading of effects is plausible, although a unifying cascade for  all personality disorders is not likely. The present study suggests a possible  cascade relevant to one personality disorder: schizoid personality disorder in  emerging adulthood. In brief, it is hypothesized that the absence of a  relationship characterized by a rich degree of psychological proximal process in  early childhood, which is associated with nurturance and the facilitation of  more complex development, predicts impairment in the actualization of the  affiliation system (i.e., that system that facilitates interpersonal  connectedness and social bonds in human beings and is under substantial genetic  influence), and this impairment in the affiliation system predicts the  appearance of schizoid personality disorder symptoms in emerging adulthood (late  teens/early 20s), which persists over time into emerging adulthood. The  impairment in the affiliation system is argued to proceed through childhood  sociality as reflected in temperament on through adult personality as reflected  in communal positive emotion. Furthermore, it is also hypothesized that the  relationship between proximal processes and the affiliation system maintains  irrespective of other childhood temperament factors that might adversely impact  early parent/caregiver and child relations. The data for a preliminary  illustration of this possible cascade are drawn from The Longitudinal Study of  Personality Disorders, which is a prospective, multiwave study of personality  disorders, personality, and temperament in a large sample of adults drawn from a  nonclinical population.

Author information: (1)School of Education, Stanford University, 485 Lasuen Mall, Stanford, CA  94305-3096, USA. jelena.obradovic@stanford.edu	This study examined developmental processes linking competence and  psychopathology in an urban sample of girls during their transition to  adolescence. Longitudinal associations among indices of externalizing symptoms,  social competence, and internalizing symptoms were also tested within contexts  of family adversity and girls' pubertal status. Child, parent, and teacher  report were employed to assess core constructs across six annual assessment  waves, starting at age 9. Results revealed the significant effect of prior  levels of externalizing symptoms on changes in social competence and  internalizing symptoms, as well as reciprocal relations between social  competence and internalizing symptoms. In addition, girl's maladaptive  functioning predicted increases in family adversity exposure over time. Last,  more mature pubertal status in early assessment waves was linked to an increase  in internalizing symptoms; however, this association was reversed by the last  assessment, when most girls had reached advance stages of puberty. The timing of  these effects reveals important targets for future interventions aimed at  promoting the successful adaptation of girls in adolescence.

Transactional relations across contextual strain, parenting quality, and early  childhood regulation and adaptation in a high-risk sample.	Yates TM(1), Obradović J, Egeland B.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA.  tuppett.yates@ucr.edu	This investigation examined transactional relations across contextual strain,  parenting quality, and child adjustment in 209 mothers and children at 24, 42,  and 72 months of age. Independent ratings of mothers' stressful life events,  social support, and relationship quality provided an objective measure of  maternal contextual strain. Observers evaluated parenting quality during  parent-child interactions at each time point. Child regulatory functioning  during laboratory tasks at 24 and 42 months was evaluated by independent  observers based on both behavioral (e.g., noncompliance, distractibility) and  emotional (e.g., frustration, anger) indices. At 72 months, teachers reported on  children's externalizing behaviors, and children completed objective measures of  academic achievement. Nested path analyses were used to evaluate increasingly  complex models of influence, including transactional relations between child and  parent, effects from contextual strain to parenting and child adaptation, and  reciprocal effects from child and parent behavior to contextual strain. Over and  above stability within each domain and cross-sectional cross-domain covariation,  significant paths emerged from maternal contextual strain to subsequent child  adjustment. Bidirectional relations between parenting and child adjustment were  especially prominent among boys. These findings counter unidirectional models of  parent-mediated contextual effects by highlighting the direct influences of  contextual strain and parent-child transactions on early childhood behavioral  and academic adjustment, respectively.

The first goal was to explore children's  trajectories of anxiety from age 6 to 12 using a representative community  sample. The second goal was to assess the link between certain behavioral  characteristics assessed in kindergarten (i.e., inattention, hyperactivity,  aggressiveness, and low prosociality) and these trajectories. The third goal was  to determine whether certain aspects of maternal parenting (i.e., warmth and  discipline) could moderate the association between these characteristics and the  trajectories of anxiety. A population sample of 2,000 children (1,001 boys, 999  girls) participated in this longitudinal study. Developmental trajectory  analyses allowed us to identify four trajectory groups: low, low-increasing,  high-declining, and high anxiety groups. Moreover, multinomial logistic  regressions revealed a profile of children at risk of developing high anxiety  symptoms (i.e., high group), characterized by sociofamily adversity,  inattention, and low prosociality in the classroom. Hyperactivity was also found  in this profile, but only for children exposed to a mother who showed little  affective warmth. Finally, mothers' high level of discipline increased the odds  of belonging to the high anxiety group. The results are discussed in relation to  studies examining the association among anxiety, behavioral characteristics, and  parenting during childhood.

Author information: (1)Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, School of Psychology, Birkbeck,  University of London, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HX, UK. a.senju@bbk.ac.uk	Recently, a series of studies demonstrated false belief understanding in young  children through completely nonverbal measures. These studies have revealed that  children younger than 3 years of age, who consistently fail the standard verbal  false belief test, can anticipate others' actions based on their attributed  false beliefs. The current study examined whether children with autism spectrum  disorder (ASD), who are known to have difficulties in the verbal false belief  test, may also show such action anticipation in a nonverbal false belief test.  We presented video stimuli of an actor watching an object being hidden in a box.  The object was then displaced while the actor was looking away. We recorded  children's eye movements and coded whether they spontaneously anticipated the  actor's subsequent behavior, which could only have been predicted if they had  attributed a false belief to her. Although typically developing children  correctly anticipated the action, children with ASD failed to show such action  anticipation. The results suggest that children with ASD have an impairment in  false belief attribution, which is independent of their verbal ability.

Author information: (1)Center for Child and Family Health, 411 West Chapel Hill Street, Suite 908,  Duke University, Durham, NC 27701, USA. karen.appleyard@duke.edu	The current study investigated concurrent and longitudinal mediated and mediated  moderation pathways among maltreatment, self-perception (i.e., loneliness and  self-esteem), social support, and internalizing and externalizing behavior  problems. For both genders, early childhood maltreatment (i.e., ages 0-6) was  related directly to internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at age 6,  and later maltreatment (i.e., ages 6-8) was directly related to internalizing  and externalizing behavior problems at age 8. Results of concurrent mediation  and mediated moderation indicated that early maltreatment was significantly  related to internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at age 6 indirectly  both through age 6 loneliness and self-esteem for boys and through age 6  loneliness for girls. Significant moderation of the pathway from early  maltreatment to self-esteem, and for boys, significant mediated moderation to  emotional and behavioral problems were found, such that the mediated effect  through self-esteem varied across levels of social support, though in an  unexpected direction. No significant longitudinal mediation or mediated  moderation was found, however, between the age 6 mediators and moderator and  internalizing or externalizing problems at age 8. The roles of the hypothesized  mediating and moderating mechanisms are discussed, with implications for  designing intervention and prevention programs.

The person-oriented approach seeks to match theories and methods that portray  development as a holistic, highly interactional, and individualized process.  Over the past decade, this approach has gained popularity in developmental  psychopathology research, particularly as model-based varieties of  person-oriented methods have emerged. Although these methods allow some  principles of person-oriented theory to be tested, little attention has been  paid to the fact that these methods cannot test other principles, and may  actually be inconsistent with certain principles. Lacking clarification  regarding which aspects of person-oriented theory are testable under which  person-oriented methods, assumptions of the methods have sometimes been  presented as testable hypotheses or interpreted as affirming the theory. This  general blurring of the line between person-oriented theory and method has even  led to the occasional perception that the method is the theory and vice versa.  We review assumptions, strengths, and limitations of model-based person-oriented  methods, clarifying which theoretical principles they can test and the  compromises and trade-offs required to do so.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Human Development, Vanderbilt University,  Nashville, TN 37203, USA. julia.w.felton@vanderbilt.edu	The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders lists weight gain or  weight loss as a symptom of depression at all ages, but no study of adolescent  depression has examined its relation to actual (not just self-reported) weight  change. In the current longitudinal study, 215 adolescents provided physical and  self-report measures of change in weight, body mass, and body fat over a 4-month  time interval. They also completed psychological measures of body  dissatisfaction, problematic eating attitudes, and depressive symptoms. The  relation between physical measures of weight change and depressive symptoms  varied with age. These relations were explained by individual differences in  body dissatisfaction, eating attitudes, and behaviors, leading to questions  about weight change as a symptom of depression in adolescence.

Trickett PK(1), Noll JG, Susman EJ, Shenk CE, Putnam FW.	Author information: (1)University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA.	Inconsistencies exist in literature examining hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA) axis activity in children and adults who have experienced childhood abuse.  Hence, the extent and manner to which childhood abuse may disrupt HPA axis  development is largely unknown. To address these inconsistencies, the  developmental course of nonstress cortisol in a long-term longitudinal study was  assessed at six time points from childhood through adolescence and into young  adulthood to determine whether childhood abuse results in disrupted cortisol  activity. Nonstress, morning cortisol was measured in 84 females with confirmed  familial sexual abuse and 89 nonabused, comparison females. Although dynamically  controlling for co-occurring depression and anxiety, hierarchical linear  modeling (HLM) showed that relative to comparison females, the linear trend for  abused females was significantly less steep when cortisol was examined across  development from age 6 to age 30, t (1, 180) = -2.55, p < .01, indicating  attenuation in cortisol activity starting in adolescence with significantly  lower levels of cortisol by early adulthood, F (1, 162) = 4.78, p < .01. As a  more direct test of the attenuation hypothesis, supplemental HLM analyses of  data arrayed by time since the disclosure of abuse indicated that cortisol  activity was initially significantly higher, t (1, 425) = 2.18, p < .05, and  slopes were significantly less steep t (1, 205) = -2.66, p < .01, for abused  females. These findings demonstrate how the experience of childhood abuse might  disrupt the neurobiology of stress, providing some support for the attenuation  hypothesis that victims of abuse may experience cortisol hyposecretion  subsequent to a period of heightened secretion.

Blandon AY(1), Calkins SD, Keane SP.	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Greensboro, USA. ablandon@psu.edu	The longitudinal associations between maternal parenting behavior and toddler  risk with children's emotional and social competence were examined during the  transition to kindergarten, in a sample of 253 children. Toddler risk was  characterized by early externalizing behavior and poor emotion regulation  skills. Given that we were interested in the multiple pathways that may result  in emotional and social competence, we examined the interactions among maternal  parenting behavior and toddler risk. There were some significant interactions,  although the pattern of results was not consistent across all competence  outcomes. Maternal parenting behavior was not directly associated with  children's emotional and social competence. In some instances, maternal control  has differential implications for children's emotional and social competence  dependent upon the child's level of early risk and maternal positive parenting.  Specifically, maternal control tended to be more detrimental for children's  emotional competence during the transition to kindergarten, when children  exhibit higher levels of risk. Overall, it appears that there are multiple  developmental pathways, depending on child and maternal characteristics that  lead to early emotional and social competence.

Developmental trajectories of restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests  in children with autism spectrum disorders.	Richler J(1), Huerta M, Bishop SL, Lord C.	Author information: (1)Indiana University, USA. jrichler@gmail.com	This study examined how restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests (RRBs)  developed over time in a sample of children with autism spectrum disorders  (ASD). One hundred ninety-two children referred for a diagnosis of autism at age  2, and 22 children with nonspectrum development disorders were evaluated with a  battery of cognitive and diagnostic measures at age 2 and subsequently at ages  3, 5, and 9. Factor analysis of the RRB items on the Autism Diagnostic  Interview-Revised revealed two RRB factors at each wave of data collection, one  comprising "repetitive sensorimotor" (RSM) behaviors and the other "insistence  on sameness" (IS) behaviors. For children with ASD, RSM scores remained  relatively high over time, indicating consistent severity, whereas IS scores  started low and increased over time, indicating worsening. Having a higher  nonverbal intelligence (NVIQ) at age 2 was associated with milder concurrent RSM  behaviors and with improvement in these behaviors over time. There was no  relationship between NVIQ at age 2 and IS behaviors. However, milder  social/communicative impairment, at age 2 was associated with more severe  concurrent IS behaviors. Trajectory analysis revealed considerable heterogeneity  in patterns of change over time for both kinds of behaviors. These findings are  discussed in terms of their implications for our understanding of RRBs in ASD  and other disorders, making prognoses about how RRBs will develop in children  with ASD as they get older, and using RRBs to identify ASD phenotypes in genetic  studies.

Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.  ginger.moore@psu.edu	Parent conflict during infancy may affect rapidly developing physiological  regulation. To examine the association between parent conflict and infants'  vagal tone functioning, mothers (N = 48) reported levels of parent conflict and  their 6-month-old male and female infants' respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)  was measured in the still-face paradigm. Higher parent conflict was related to  lower RSA at baseline and each episode of the still-face paradigm. Infants in  relatively higher conflict families showed attenuated RSA withdrawal in response  to mothers' disengagement and attenuated RSA activation when interacting with  mothers. Findings suggest atypical RSA regulation and reliance on  self-regulation for infants in families with moderate levels of parent conflict.  Implications for later development and future research are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457940999023X PMCID: PMC2889485 PMID: 20102644 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Thomaes S(1), Bushman BJ, Orobio de Castro B, Stegge H.	Author information: (1)Department of Developmental Psychology, Utrecht University, P.O. Box 80.140,  Utrecht 3584 CS, The Netherlands, USA. s.thomaes@uu.nl	Narcissism is a dynamic form of personality characterized by a pervasive sense  of grandiosity and self-importance, and by a need to obtain continuous  self-validation from others. Very little is known about its etiology and  development. What factors (e.g., temperament, parenting experiences) and  processes (e.g., transactions between these factors over time) cause some  children to become more narcissistic than others? When does narcissism first  emerge, and how does narcissism develop over time? This article describes a  framework for research on the etiology and development of narcissism, and  recommends ten research priorities. This research should yield fundamental  knowledge and should inform intervention efforts to minimize the negative impact  narcissistic individuals have on themselves and on others.

Examining the developmental history of child maltreatment, peer relations, and  externalizing problems among adolescents with symptoms of paranoid personality  disorder.	Natsuaki MN(1), Cicchetti D, Rogosch FA.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of California, Riverside, 900 University  Avenue, Riverside, CA 92521, USA.	This study examined the childhood history of maltreatment, peer relations, and  externalizing problems among individuals who manifested low, moderate, or high  symptom levels of paranoid personality disorder (PPD) in adolescence.  Participants included 174 children who attended a longitudinal summer camp  research program between the ages of 9 to 12. Multiple sources of information  (self-, peer, and counselor reports) were utilized. Subsequently, they  participated in a personality disorder assessment during adolescence (mean age =  15.30). The results indicated that children who manifested higher levels of PPD  symptoms in adolescence had higher odds of having a history of child  maltreatment. Children who manifested high levels of PPD symptoms in adolescence  showed a faster growth rate for peer bullying and externalizing problems in  childhood. In addition, their peers rated them as less cooperative, less likely  to be leaders, and more likely to initiate fights. These findings suggested that  children who manifested elevated PPD symptoms in adolescence had shown early  signs of behavioral disturbances in childhood, some of which gradually worsened  as they approach adolescence.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.  lrb@psychology.su.se	In the study of developmental psychopathology a dimensional, variable-oriented  approach dominates over a typological approach. With the person-oriented  research paradigm providing the metatheoretical framework, pros and cons of  these two approaches are discussed, and it is pointed to different  methodological realizations of the typological approach, and to the contexts  where they might be appropriate. It is also pointed out that the two important  and underused concepts of equifinality and multifinality with advantage can be  incorporated in a person-oriented approach. An empirical example is given of the  study of the structure of early adolescent problem behaviors and their  relationship to later criminality where dimensional as well as typological  analyses are carried out. The usefulness of the typological approach in studying  the development and early manifestations of the personality disorder psychopathy  is also discussed. It is concluded that the usefulness of a typological approach  appears to be underestimated.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409000522 PMID: 19583893 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Child maltreatment and trajectories of personality and behavioral functioning:  implications for the development of personality disorder.	Kim J(1), Cicchetti D, Rogosch FA, Manly JT.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State  University, Blacksburg, VA 24061, USA. jungmeen@vt.edu	This study investigated the longitudinal impact of maltreatment parameters on  personality processes and maladjustment and prospective relationships between  personality trajectory classes and subsequent maladjustment outcomes. The sample  involved maltreated (n = 249) and nonmaltreated (n = 200) children followed  longitudinally between ages 6 and 10. Growth mixture modeling indicated  multifinality in personality development depending on the risk status (i.e.,  maltreated vs. nonmaltreated). Two trajectory classes of ego resiliency were  identified for maltreated children: those who showed a declining trajectory  exhibited greater maladjustment. In contrast, three trajectory classes of ego  control were identified for nonmaltreated children; the subgroups showing  increases in ego undercontrol or dramatic changes from high ego undercontrol to  high ego overcontrol exhibited poor adjustment. Experiencing multiple  maltreatment subtypes and physical/sexual abuse were related to higher levels of  ego undercontrol and externalizing symptomatology, whereas early onset of  maltreatment was associated with the low and decreasing trajectory of ego  resiliency and higher levels of internalizing symptomatology. The findings  suggest that ego resiliency and ego control, personality processes related to  self-regulation, may be important factors in identifying distinct pathways to  later personality disorders as well as pathways to resilient functioning.

Burger, Jessica [corrected to Berger,  Jessica M].	The present paper focuses on the trait domain of conscientiousness, its  development, and its relation to psychopathology. The definition of  conscientiousness and its interface with specific forms of psychopathology, such  as externalizing psychopathology, are discussed first. Then an overview of the  known developmental changes in conscientiousness across the life course is  provided, as well as the potential shared developmental etiology of  conscientiousness and externalizing psychopathology. Given the lack of data,  testing etiological factors that may contribute to the development of both  conscientiousness and externalizing disorders, we report on three studies  examining the childhood experiences associated with both conscientiousness and  externalizing behaviors. Last, future directions are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409000479 PMID: 19583888 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

A structural-developmental psychodynamic approach to psychopathology: two  polarities of experience across the life span.	Blatt SJ(1), Luyten P.	Author information: (1)Departments of Psychiatry and Psychology, Yale University, New Haven, CT  06511, USA. sidney.blatt@yale.edu	Consistent with principles of developmental psychopathology, this paper presents  a broad psychodynamic structural developmental perspective that establishes  conceptual continuities between processes of normal personality development,  personality organization, concepts of psychopathology, and processes of  therapeutic change. The major assumption of this approach is that personality  development proceeds in a dialectic synergistic interaction between the  development of capacities for interpersonal relatedness and the development of  self-definition or identity. Extensive research demonstrates that these two  dimensions define two broad types of personality organization, each with a  particular experiential mode; preferred forms of cognition, defense, and  adaptation; unique qualities of interpersonal relatedness and specific types of  object and self-representation. Severe disruptions of this normal dialectic  developmental process result in various forms of psychopathology organized in  two basic configurations in which there is distorted defensive preoccupation, at  different developmental levels, with one of these polarities (relatedness or  self-definition) at the expense of the development of the other dimension. This  paper reviews empirical findings supporting this approach to normal and  disrupted personality development throughout the life cycle and considers its  relationship to the internalizing-externalizing distinction in childhood and  adolescence, attachment theory, and research on the interaction between  biological and psychosocial factors in development across the life span.  Finally, we discuss the implications of this approach for intervention and  prevention.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409000431 PMID: 19583884 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506-0044,  USA. widiger@uky.edu	One of the fundamental limitations of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of  Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) categorical model of  personality disorder classification has been the lack of a strong scientific  foundation, including an understanding of childhood antecedents. The DSM-IV-TR  personality disorders, however, do appear to be well understood as maladaptive  variants of the domains and facets of the general personality structure as  conceptualized within the five-factor model (FFM). Integrating the  classification of personality disorder with the FFM brings to an understanding  of the personality disorders a considerable body of scientific research on  childhood antecedents. The temperaments and traits of childhood do appear to be  antecedent to the FFM of adult personality structure, and these temperament and  traits of childhood and adolescence are the likely antecedents for adult  personality disorder, providing further support for the conceptualization of the  adult personality disorders as maladaptive variants of the domains and facets of  the FFM. Conceptualizing personality disorders in terms of the FFM thereby  provides a basis for integrating the classification of abnormal and normal  personality functioning across the life span.

Depression as a longitudinal outcome and antecedent of preadolescents' peer  relationships and peer-relevant cognition.	Zimmer-Gembeck MJ(1), Hunter TA, Waters AM, Pronk R.	Author information: (1)School of Psychology,Griffith University- Gold Coast Campus, Private Mail Bag  50 GCMC, Southport, Queensland 9726, Australia. m.zimmergembeck@griffith.edu.au	Using longitudinal data and structural modeling, we investigated bidirectional  associations among preadolescents' peer relationships, peer-relevant cognition,  and depressive symptoms. Depression was expected to be an outcome and precursor  of peer-relevant cognition, and cognition was expected to be an outcome and  precursor of being more or less liked by classmates (peer likeability). We also  examined whether cognition mediated the association between peer likeability and  depression. Participants were 308 students (mean age = 11.0, SD = 0.9) who  participated twice during a school year. A third assessment was completed with  Grade 5 to 6 students 1 year after the second assessment. The model with  bidirectional paths had a good fit to the data, but the most parsimonious model  was an "effects" model showing that preadolescents with more depressive symptoms  had less positive peer-relevant cognition at later assessments, and that those  with more positive peer-relevant cognition were more liked by their peers over  time. There were no age differences, some gender differences, and no support for  cognition as a moderator of the association between depression and peer  likeability.

Academic achievement of homeless and highly mobile children in an urban school  district: longitudinal evidence on risk, growth, and resilience.	Obradović J(1), Long JD, Cutuli JJ, Chan CK, Hinz E, Heistad D, Masten AS.	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, USA. jelena.obradovic@ubc.ca	Longitudinal growth trajectories of reading and math achievement were studied in  four primary school grade cohorts (GCs) of a large urban district to examine  academic risk and resilience in homeless and highly mobile (H/HM) students.  Initial achievement was assessed when student cohorts were in the second, third,  fourth, and fifth grades, and again 12 and 18 months later. Achievement  trajectories of H/HM students were compared to low-income but nonmobile students  and all other tested students in the district, controlling for four  well-established covariates of achievement: sex, ethnicity, attendance, and  English language skills. Both disadvantaged groups showed markedly lower initial  achievement than their more advantaged peers, and H/HM students manifested the  greatest risk, consistent with an expected risk gradient. Moreover, in some GCs,  both disadvantaged groups showed slower growth than their relatively advantaged  peers. Closer examination of H/HM student trajectories in relation to national  test norms revealed striking variability, including cases of academic resilience  as well as problems. H/HM students may represent a major component of  "achievement gaps" in urban districts, but these students also constitute a  heterogeneous group of children likely to have markedly diverse educational  needs. Efforts to close gaps or enhance achievement in H/HM children require  more differentiated knowledge of vulnerability and protective processes that may  shape individual development and achievement.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Arizona, 1503 East University  Boulevard, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA. rgf2@u.arizona.edu	This study examined the mediating role of loneliness (assessed by self-report at  Time 2; Grade 6) in the relation between early social preference (assessed by  peer report at Time 1; kindergarten through Grade 3) and adolescent  anxious/depressed symptoms (assessed by mother, teacher, and self-reports at  Time 3; Grades 7-9). Five hundred eighty-five boys and girls (48% female; 16%  African American) from three geographic sites of the Child Development Project  were followed from kindergarten through Grade 9. Loneliness partially mediated  and uniquely incremented the significant effect of low social preference in  childhood on anxious/depressed symptoms in adolescence, controlling for early  anxious/depressed symptoms at Time 1. Findings are critical to understanding the  psychological functioning through which early social experiences affect youths'  maladjusted development.

In this study, cross-sectional  relationships between language, attention, and behavior problems were examined  using parent report, videotaped observations, and performance measures in a  sample of 116 severely and profoundly deaf and 69 normally hearing children ages  1.5 to 5 years. Secondary analyses were performed on data collected as part of  the Childhood Development After Cochlear Implantation Study, funded by the  National Institutes of Health. Hearing-impaired children showed more language,  attention, and behavioral difficulties, and spent less time communicating with  their parents than normally hearing children. Structural equation modeling  indicated there were significant relationships between language, attention, and  child behavior problems. Language was associated with behavior problems both  directly and indirectly through effects on attention. Amount of parent-child  communication was not related to behavior problems.

King S(1), Mancini-Marïe A, Brunet A, Walker E, Meaney MJ, Laplante DP.	Author information: (1)Douglas Hospital Research Centre, Verdun, Quebec, Canada.  suzanne.king@douglas.mcgill.ca	Dermatoglyphic asymmetry of fingertip ridge counts is more frequent in  schizophrenia patients than normal controls, and may reflect disruptions in  fetal development during Weeks 14-22 when fingerprints develop. However, there  are no data in humans linking specific adverse events at specific times to  dermatoglyphic asymmetries. Our objective was to determine whether prenatal  exposure to a natural disaster (1998 Quebec ice storm) during Weeks 14-22 would  result in increased dermatoglyphic asymmetry in children, and to determine the  roles of maternal objective stress exposure, subjective stress reaction, and  postdisaster cortisol. Ridge counts for homologous fingers were scored for 77  children (20 target exposed [Weeks 14-22] and 57 nontarget exposed [exposed  during other gestation weeks]). Children in the target group had more than 0.50  SD greater asymmetry than the nontarget group. Within the target group, children  whose mothers had high subjective ice storm stress had significantly greater  asymmetry than those with lower stress mothers, and maternal postdisaster  cortisol had a significant negative correlation with the children's  dermatoglyphic asymmetry (r = -.56). Prenatal maternal stress during the period  of fingerprint development results in greater dermatoglyphic asymmetry in their  children, especially in the face of greater maternal distress.

Author information: (1)Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology, University of  Rochester, RC Box 270266, Rochester, NY 14627-0266, USA.  mandi.burnette@rochester.edu	The authors tested whether emerging borderline personality disorder (BPD)  symptoms mediated the association between childhood physical abuse (CPA) and  aggression among incarcerated girls. Participants were 121 incarcerated  adolescent girls (13-19 years old). Three forms of aggression (relational,  overt, and violent offending behavior) and exposure to CPA by a parental figure  were assessed using self-report inventories, whereas BPD symptoms were evaluated  using a structured interview. Mediation models, including tests of indirect  effects, were conducted in which each form of aggression was predicted from CPA  with BPD symptoms entered as a mediator. A divergent pattern emerged in which  BPD symptoms mediated the relationship between CPA and violent offending, but  not less severe forms of overt aggression. Relational aggression, although  correlated with CPA, was not associated with BPD symptoms. Implications for the  conceptualization and treatment of girls' aggression within the context of  interpersonal functioning are discussed.

Cunningham JN(1), Kliewer W, Garner PW.	Author information: (1)Commonwealth Counseling Associates, Mechanicsville, VA 23116, USA.  jncunningham@commonwealthcounseling.com	The prospective relation of maternal emotion philosophy to children's emotion  understanding and regulation and positive and negative adjustment was  investigated. Sixty-nine African American youth (50% male; M age = 11.29 years)  and their maternal caregivers living in high violence areas of a midsized city  participated in this interview study. Caregivers' meta-emotion philosophy  predicted child emotion understanding and emotion regulation, which also were  associated with Time 2 grades, internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors,  and social skills after controlling for Time 1 adjustment. Emotional  understanding mediated the relationship between caregivers' emotional  socialization and boys' internalizing behaviors and between caregivers'  emotional socialization and girls' social skills. In addition, emotion  regulation mediated the relationships between emotional socialization and all  four outcomes for boys. Implications for future work on emotion socialization  and clinical intervention, particularly related to emotion regulation, are  discussed.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Wayne State University, Maccabees Building, 7th  Floor, 5057 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, MI 48201, USA. pfowler@wayne.edu	Meta-analytic techniques were used to estimate the effects of exposure to  community violence on mental health outcomes across 114 studies. Community  violence had its strongest effects on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and  externalizing problems and smallest impact on other internalizing symptoms.  Victimization by community violence most predicted symptomatology compared to  witnessing or hearing about community violence. Witnessing community violence  had a greater effect than hearing about violence on externalizing problems, but  both types of exposure had an equal impact on other internalizing problems. PTSD  symptoms were equally predicted by victimization, witnessing, or hearing about  community violence. Compared to children, adolescents reported a stronger  relationship between externalizing behaviors and exposure, whereas children  exhibited greater internalizing problems than did adolescents.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, State University of New York at Oswego, Oswego, NY  13126, USA. gump@oswego.edu	Maternal depression has a number of adverse effects on children. In the present  study, maternal depressive symptoms were assessed (using the Center for  Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) when their child was 3 months, 6  months, 1 year, 2 years, 4.25 years, 6 years, 7 years, 8 years, and 10 years of  age. At 9.5 years of age, children's (94 females, 82 males) depressive symptoms  as well as cardiovascular and cortisol levels during baseline and two  psychologically stressful tasks were measured. Using multilevel modeling,  maternal depressive symptom trajectories were considered in relation to their  child's adrenocortical and cardiovascular responses to acute stress. Our goal  was to determine maternal depressive symptom trajectories for children with  elevated cardiovascular and cortisol reactivity to acute stress and elevated  depressive symptoms. In general, those mothers with chronically elevated  depressive symptoms over their child's life span had children with lower initial  cortisol, higher cardiac output and stroke volume in response to acute stress,  lower vascular resistance during acute stress tasks, and significantly more  depressive symptoms at 9.5 years of age. These results are discussed in the  context of established associations among hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis  dysregulation, depression, and cardiovascular disease.

Zajac K(1), Kobak R.	Author information: (1)University of Delaware, USA.	This study examines the intergenerational effects of caregivers' unresolved loss  and abuse on children's behavior problems from middle childhood to early  adolescence in an economically disadvantaged sample. One hundred twenty-four  caregivers completed the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and a lifetime trauma  interview during the age 13 wave of the study. Child behavior problems were  assessed at four time points (ages 6, 8, 10, and 13) with teacher-reported Child  Behavior Checklist total problem scales. The children of insecure caregivers  with unresolved loss showed a consistent pattern of increased behavior problems  from middle childhood to early adolescence. Caregivers' AAI status accounted for  more variance in child behavior problems than did an alternative model of  caregiver psychopathology (depression and dissociation). The results extend the  literature on the effects of caregiver unresolved states of mind beyond infancy  to older children and adolescents.

Transactional processes in child disruptive behavior and maternal depression: a  longitudinal study from early childhood to adolescence.	Gross HE(1), Shaw DS, Burwell RA, Nagin DS.	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA. heg6@pitt.edu	Although much has been written about the utility of applying Sameroff and  Chandler's transactional perspective to the study of child psychopathology,  relatively few researchers have used such an approach to trace the emergence of  child problem behavior from infancy to adolescence. Using a sample of 289 male  toddlers from predominantly low-income families, the current study examined  associations between various forms of early child disruptive behavior,  subsequent trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms over the course of 8  years, and adolescent problem behavior. Results indicated that early child  noncompliance was the most robust predictor of more chronic and elevated  trajectories of maternal depression, which in turn discriminated teacher and  youth reports of adolescent antisocial behavior but not internalizing symptoms.  The findings were consistent with transactional perspectives of developmental  psychopathology that have emphasized the dynamic interplay between child and  parent characteristics.

Author information: (1)Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.  constantino@wustl.edu	Recent research has suggested that autistic social impairment (ASI) is  continuously distributed in nature and that subtle autistic-like social  impairments aggregate in the family members of children with pervasive  developmental disorders (PDDs). This study examined the longitudinal course of  quantitatively characterized ASI in 3- to 18-year-old boys with and without PDD.  We obtained assessments of 95 epidemiologically ascertained male-male twin pairs  and a clinical sample of 95 affected children using the Social Responsiveness  Scale (SRS), at two time points, spaced 1-5 years apart. Longitudinal course was  examined as a function of age, familial loading for PDD, and autistic severity  at baseline. Interindividual variation in SRS scores was highly preserved over  time, with test-retest correlation of 0.90 for the entire sample. SRS scores  exhibited modest general improvement over the study period; individual  trajectories varied as a function of severity at baseline and were highly  familial. Quantitative measurements of ASI reflect heritable traitlike  characteristics. Such measurements can serve as reliable indices of phenotypic  severity for genetic and neurobiologic studies, and have potential utility for  ascertaining incremental response to intervention.

Pubertal changes in emotional information processing: pupillary, behavioral, and  subjective evidence during emotional word identification.

This study investigated pupillary and behavioral responses to an emotional word  valence identification paradigm among 32 pre-/early pubertal and 34 mid-/late  pubertal typically developing children and adolescents. Participants were asked  to identify the valence of positive, negative, and neutral words while pupil  dilation was assessed using an eyetracker. Mid-/late pubertal children showed  greater peak pupillary reactivity to words presented during the emotional word  identification task than pre-/early pubertal children, regardless of word  valence. Mid-/late pubertal children also showed smaller sustained pupil  dilation than pre-/early pubertal children after the word was no longer on  screen. These findings were replicated controlling for participants' age. In  addition, mid-/late pubertal children had faster reaction times to all words,  and rated themselves as more emotional during their laboratory visit compared to  pre-/early pubertal children. Greater recall of emotional words following the  task was associated with mid-/late pubertal status, and greater recall of  emotional words was also associated with higher peak pupil dilation. These  results provide physiological, behavioral, and subjective evidence consistent  with a model of puberty-specific changes in neurobehavioral systems underpinning  emotional reactivity.

The amygdala, striatum, and structures  within the prefrontal cortex are highly involved in mediating these stages of  emotion processing, and evidence indicates that these regions show structural  and functional alterations in different types of psychopathology, including  anxiety, depression, and autism spectrum disorders. However, we do not know how  genes and the environment interact to alter development of these brain regions  in ways that give rise to emotion-related psychopathology. This review discusses  the current understanding of brain regions that are involved in emotional  functioning, how they develop, and how they are altered in three forms of  psychopathology: anxiety, depression, and autism spectrum disorders. Following  this, a framework is described that may facilitate the integration of  investigations of genetic variation and brain function with symptom and  diagnostic measures. The framework involves three components: (a) a greater  emphasis on simultaneously analyzing multiple levels (genes, brain function,  behavior, symptoms, and diagnoses); (b) further integration of developmental  considerations, including timing of environmental events, adaptations (or  maladaptations), and disorder-related trajectories that guide some children  toward atypical experiences; and (c) greater cross-talk between animal and human  investigations to take advantage of biological measures that cannot be acquired  in humans.

Crone EA(1), Bullens L, van der Plas EA, Kijkuit EJ, Zelazo PD.	Author information: (1)Leiden University Institute for Psychological Research, The Netherlands.  ecrone@fsw.leidenuniv.nl	Despite the assumed prevalence of risk-taking behavior in adolescence, the  laboratory evidence of risk taking remains scarce, and the individual variation  poorly understood. Drawing from neuroscience studies, we tested whether risk and  reward orientation are influenced by the perspective that adolescents take when  making risky decisions. Perspective taking was manipulated by cuing participants  prior to each choice whether the decision was made for "self," or from the  perspective of an "other" (the experimenter in Experiment 1; a hypothetical peer  in Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, we show a developmental decrease in  risk-taking behavior across different stages of adolescence. In addition, all  age groups made fewer risky choices for the experimenter, but the difference  between self and other was larger in early adolescence. In Experiment 2, we show  that high sensation-seeking (SS) adolescents make more risky choices than low SS  adolescents, but both groups make a similar differentiation for other  individuals (low risk-taking or high risk-taking peers). Together, the results  show that younger adolescents and high SS adolescents make more risky choices  for themselves, but can appreciate that others may make fewer risky choices. The  developmental change toward more rational decisions versus emotional, impulsive  decisions may reflect, in part, more efficient integration of others'  perspectives into one's decision making. These developmental results are  discussed regarding brain systems important for risk taking and perspective  taking.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579408000588 PMID: 18838039 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Altered amygdala and hippocampus function in adolescents with hypercortisolemia:  a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of Cushing syndrome.	Maheu FS(1), Mazzone L, Merke DP, Keil MF, Stratakis CA, Pine DS, Ernst M.	Author information: (1)National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892-2670, USA.	Chronic elevations of endogenous cortisol levels have been shown to alter medial  temporal cortical structures and to be accompanied by declarative memory  impairments and depressive symptoms in human adults. These effects of elevated  endogenous levels of cortisol have not been directly studied in adolescents.  Because adolescents with Cushing syndrome show endogenous elevations in  cortisol, they represent a unique natural model to study the effects of  prolonged hypercortisolemia on brain function, and memory and affective  processes during this developmental stage. Using functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI), we compared 12 adolescents with Cushing syndrome with 22 healthy  control adolescents on amygdala and anterior hippocampus activation during an  emotional faces encoding task. None of these adolescents manifested depressive  symptoms. Encoding success was assessed using a memory recognition test  performed after the scan. The fMRI analyses followed an event-related design and  were conducted using the SPM99 platform. Compared to healthy adolescents,  patients with Cushing syndrome showed greater left amygdala and right anterior  hippocampus activation during successful face encoding. Memory performance for  faces recognition did not differ between groups. This first study of cerebral  function in adolescents with chronic endogenous hypercortisolemia due to Cushing  syndrome demonstrates the presence of functional alterations in amygdala and  hippocampus, which are not associated with affective or memory impairments. Such  findings need to be followed by work examining the role of age and related brain  maturational stage on these effects, as well as the identification of possible  protective factors conferring resilience to affective and cognitive consequences  in this disease and/or during this stage of cerebral development.

Crowe SL(1), Blair RJ.	Author information: (1)National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,  MD 20892, USA.	The recent development of low-risk imaging technologies, such as functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have had a significant impact on the  investigation of psychopathologies in children and adolescents. This review  considers what we can infer from fMRI work regarding the development of conduct  disorder (CD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). We make two central  assumptions that are grounded in the empirical literature. First, the diagnoses  of CD and ODD identify individuals with heterogeneous pathologies; that is,  different developmental pathologies can receive a CDD or ODD diagnosis. This is  indicated by the comorbidities associated with CD/ODD, some of which appear to  be mutually exclusive at the biological level (e.g., posttraumatic stress  disorder [PTSD] and psychopathic tendencies). Second, two populations of  antisocial individuals can be identified: those that show an increased risk for  only reactive aggression and those that show an increased risk for both reactive  and instrumental aggression. We review the fMRI data indicating that particular  comorbidities of CD/ODD (i.e., mood and anxiety conditions such as childhood  bipolar disorder and PTSD) are associated with either increased responsiveness  of neural regions implicated in the basic response to threat (e.g., the  amygdala) or decreased responsiveness in regions of frontal cortex (e.g.,  ventromedial frontal cortex) that are implicated in the regulation of the basic  threat response. We suggest why such pathology would increase the risk for  reactive aggression and, in turn, lead to the association with a CD/ODD  diagnosis. We also review the literature on psychopathic tendencies, a condition  where the individual is at significantly elevated risk for both reactive and  instrumental aggression. We show that in individuals with psychopathic  tendencies, the functioning of the amygdala in stimulus-reinforcement learning  and of the ventromedial frontal cortex in the representation of reinforcement  expectancies is impaired. We suggest why such pathology would increase the risk  for reactive and instrumental aggression and thus also lead to the association  with a CD/ODD diagnosis.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Baker Hall 342c, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000  Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213,USA. kpelphrey@cmu.edu	We describe recent progress in our program of research that aims to use  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify and delineate the brain  systems involved in social perception and to chart the development of those  systems and their roles as mechanisms supporting the development of social  cognition in children, adolescents, and adults with and without autism. This  research program was initiated with the intention of further specifying the role  of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) region in the network of  neuroanatomical structures comprising the social brain. Initially, this work  focused on evaluating STS function when typically developing adults were engaged  in the visual analysis of other people's actions and intentions. We concluded  that that the STS region plays an important role in social perception via its  involvement in representing and predicting the actions and social intentions of  other people from an analysis of biological-motion cues. These studies of  typically developing people provided a set of core findings and a methodological  approach that informed a set of fMRI studies of social perception dysfunction in  autism. The work has established that dysfunction in the STS region, as well as  reduced connectivity between this region and other social brain structures  including the fusiform gyrus and amygdala, play a role in the pathophysiology of  social perception deficits in autism. Most recently, this research program has  incorporated a developmental perspective in beginning to chart the development  of the STS region in children with and without autism.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience,  University of Chicago, 5848 South University Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.  decety@uchicago.edu	The psychological construct of empathy refers to an intersubjective induction  process by which positive and negative emotions are shared, without losing sight  of whose feelings belong to whom. Empathy can lead to personal distress or to  empathic concern (sympathy). The goal of this paper is to address the underlying  cognitive processes and their neural underpinnings that constitute empathy  within a developmental neuroscience perspective. In addition, we focus on how  these processes go awry in developmental disorders marked by impairments in  social cognition, such as autism spectrum disorder, and conduct disorder. We  argue that empathy involves both bottom-up and top-down information processing,  underpinned by specific and interacting neural systems. We discuss data from  developmental psychology as well as cognitive neuroscience in support of such a  model, and highlight the impact of neural dysfunctions on social cognitive  developmental behavior. Altogether, bridging developmental science and cognitive  neuroscience helps approach a more complete understanding of social cognition.  Synthesizing these two domains also contributes to a better characterization of  developmental psychopathologies that impacts the development of effective  treatment strategies.

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, 51 East River Road, University of Minnesota,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. hunti011@umn.edu	Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are increasingly  common research methods among investigators interested in typically and  atypically developing populations. However, the effective use of these tools  requires an understanding of the basis of the magnetic resonance signal, as well  as some of the additional experimental complications that arise when collecting  MRI data from developmental populations. This primer provides a foundation for  investigators who wish to utilize MRI methods in their research and whose  primary interest involves typically and atypically developing populations. The  basic concepts of MRI physics are introduced, as well as the typical MRI scanner  components and their role in MRI data acquisition. In addition, a variety of  scan types (structural, functional, diffusion tensor) are discussed, along with  a number of important experimental design factors that can impact the quality  and utility of the data collected. Special consideration is given to working  with pediatric and special populations.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579408000497 PMID: 18838030 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Changes in the neural bases of emotion regulation associated with clinical  improvement in children with behavior problems.	Lewis MD(1), Granic I, Lamm C, Zelazo PD, Stieben J, Todd RM, Moadab I, Pepler  D.	Author information: (1)University of Toronto, Canada. mlewis@oise.utoronto.ca	Children's behavior problems may stem from ineffective cortical mechanisms for  regulating negative emotions, and the success of interventions may depend on  their impact on such mechanisms. We examined neurophysiological markers  associated with emotion regulation in children comorbid for externalizing and  internalizing problems before and after treatment. We hypothesized that  treatment success would correspond with reduced ventral prefrontal activation,  and increased dorsomedial prefrontal activation, at the time point of an  event-related potential (ERP) associated with inhibitory control. Twenty-seven  8- to 12-year-old children (with usable data) were tested before and after a  14-week community-based treatment program and assessed as to improvement status.  Fifteen 8- to 12-year-olds from the normal population (with usable data) were  tested over the same interval. All children completed an emotion-induction  go/no-go task while fitted with a 128-channel electrode net at each test  session. ERP amplitudes, and estimates of cortical activation in prefrontal  regions of interest, were measured at the peak of the "inhibitory" N2 and  compared between improvers, nonimprovers, and nonclinical children. ERP  amplitudes showed no group differences. However, improvers showed an overall  reduction in ventral prefrontal activation from pretreatment to posttreatment,  bringing them in line with nonclinical children, whereas ventral activation  remained high for nonimprovers. Both improvers and nonimprovers showed high  dorsal activation relative to nonclinical children. Supplementary analyses  indicated that only ventral prefrontal regions, and only within the N2 time  window, showed decreased activity from pre- to posttreatment, suggesting changes  in regulatory processes rather than in overall emotional arousal. These  cortically mediated changes may permit a reduction in the overengaged, rigid  style of emotion regulation characteristic of children with behavior problems.

Dozier M(1), Peloso E, Lewis E, Laurenceau JP, Levine S.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, USA.  mdozier@udel.edu	Studies with nonhuman primates and rodents, as well as with human children, have  suggested that early separations from caregivers are often associated with  changes in the functioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. On  the basis of these findings, we designed a relational intervention that was  intended to normalize HPA functioning among children in foster care. This paper  presents findings from a randomized clinical trial that assessed the  effectiveness of a relational intervention (Attachment and Biobehavioral  Catch-up [ABC]) with regard to HPA functioning. The ABC intervention was  intended to enhance children's ability to regulate physiology and behavior. The  control intervention (Developmental Education for Families) was intended to  enhance children's cognitive skills. A comparison group of children who had  never been in foster care was also included. Children's cortisol production was  assessed upon arrival at the lab, and 15 and 30 min following the Strange  Situation. Random effects analyses of variance were performed to assess  differences in initial values and change between children in the two  intervention groups. Children in the ABC intervention and comparison group  children showed lower initial values of cortisol than children in the treatment  control group, considering arrival at lab as initial values (p < .05). Groups  did not differ significantly in change over time. These results suggest that the  ABC intervention is effective in helping children regulate biology in ways more  characteristic of children who have not experienced early adversity.

Beauchaine TP(1), Neuhaus E, Brenner SL, Gatzke-Kopp L.	Author information: (1)University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-1525, USA.  tbeaucha@u.washington.edu	Most contemporary accounts of psychopathology acknowledge the importance of both  biological and environmental influences on behavior. In developmental  psychopathology, multiple etiological mechanisms for psychiatric disturbance are  well recognized, including those operating at genetic, neurobiological, and  environmental levels of analysis. However, neuroscientific principles are rarely  considered in current approaches to prevention or intervention. In this article,  we explain why a deeper understanding of the genetic and neural substrates of  behavior is essential for the next generation of preventive interventions, and  we outline 10 specific reasons why considering biological processes can improve  treatment efficacy. Among these, we discuss (a) the role of biomarkers and  endophenotypes in identifying those most in need of prevention; (b) implications  for treatment of genetic and neural mechanisms of homotypic comorbidity,  heterotypic comorbidity, and heterotypic continuity; (c) ways in which  biological vulnerabilities moderate the effects of environmental experience; (d)  situations in which Biology x Environment interactions account for more variance  in key outcomes than main effects; and (e) sensitivity of neural systems, via  epigenesis, programming, and neural plasticity, to environmental moderation  across the life span. For each of the 10 reasons outlined we present an example  from current literature and discuss critical implications for prevention.

Yates TM(1), Carlson EA, Egeland B.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of California, 2320 Olmsted Hall,  Riverside, CA 92521, USA. tuppett.yates@ucr.edu	In conjunction with prospective ratings of child maltreatment (i.e., sexual  abuse, physical abuse, and physical neglect) and measures of dissociation and  somatization, this study examined prospective pathways between child  maltreatment and nonsuicidal, direct self-injurious behavior (SIB; e.g.,  cutting, burning, self-hitting). Ongoing participants in the Minnesota  Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N = 164; 83 males, 81 females)  completed a semistructured interview about SIB when they were 26 years old. SIB  emerged as a heterogeneous and prominent phenomenon in this low-income,  mixed-gender, community sample. Child sexual abuse predicted recurrent injuring  (i.e., three or more events; n = 13), whereas child physical abuse appeared more  salient for intermittent injuring (i.e., one to two events; n = 13). Moreover,  these relations appeared largely independent of risk factors that have been  associated with child maltreatment and/or SIB, including child cognitive  ability, socioeconomic status, maternal life stress, familial disruption, and  childhood exposure to partner violence. Dissociation and somatization were  related to SIB and, to a lesser degree, child maltreatment. However, only  dissociation emerged as a significant mediator of the observed relation between  child sexual abuse and recurrent SIB. The findings are discussed within a  developmental psychopathology framework in which SIB is viewed as a compensatory  regulatory strategy in posttraumatic adaptation.

Substance use and related behaviors among suburban late adolescents: the  importance of perceived parent containment.	Luthar SS(1), Goldstein AS.	Author information: (1)Teachers College, Columbia University, Box133, 525 West 120th Street, New  York, NY 10027, USA. luthar@exchange.tc.columbia.edu	This study builds upon prior findings of elevated substance use among suburban  high school students, examining the ramifications of different parenting  dimensions on substance use and related behaviors. The sample consisted of 258  11th graders in an affluent suburban community. Parenting predictors considered  included those well-studied previously such as monitoring and closeness, as well  as two newer dimensions: perceived containment (stringency of anticipated  reactions in reaction to negative behaviors) and perceived commitment (e.g.,  helping the child despite other commitments). Outcomes included self-reported  substance use, delinquency, and rule breaking, as well as teacher-rated  inattentiveness and school grades. Findings showed elevated substance use among  these 17-year-olds compared with national norms, especially among girls. Of the  parent predictors, significant unique links with multiple outcomes were found  for parents' knowledge of their children's activities and perceived parental  containment (stringent repercussions) in reaction to the children's substance  use.

Rich BA(1), Grimley ME, Schmajuk M, Blair KS, Blair RJ, Leibenluft E.	Author information: (1)National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Building  15K, Room 204, MSC2670, Bethesda, MD 20892-2670, USA. brendanrich@mail.nih.gov	Children with narrow phenotype bipolar disorder (NP-BD; i.e., history of at  least one hypomanic or manic episode with euphoric mood) are deficient when  labeling face emotions. It is unknown if this deficit is specific to particular  emotions, or if it extends to children with severe mood dysregulation (SMD;  i.e., chronic irritability and hyperarousal without episodes of mania).  Thirty-nine NP-BD, 31 SMD, and 36 control subjects completed the emotional  expression multimorph task, which presents gradations of facial emotions from  100% neutrality to 100% emotional expression (happiness, surprise, fear,  sadness, anger, and disgust). Groups were compared in terms of intensity of  emotion required before identification occurred and accuracy. Both NP-BD and SMD  youth required significantly more morphs than controls to label correctly  disgusted, surprised, fearful, and happy faces. Impaired face labeling  correlated with deficient social reciprocity skills in NP-BD youth and  dysfunctional family relationships in SMD youth. Compared to controls, patients  with NP-BD or SMD require significantly more intense facial emotion before they  are able to label the emotion correctly. These deficits are associated with  psychosocial impairments. Understanding the neural circuitry associated with  face-labeling deficits has the potential to clarify the pathophysiology of these  disorders.

Kertes DA(1), Gunnar MR, Madsen NJ, Long JD.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, 51 East River Road, University of Minnesota,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.	Animal studies reveal that early deprivation impairs regulation of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, potentially increasing  vulnerability to stressors throughout life. To examine early deprivation effects  on basal HPA axis activity in humans, basal cortisol levels were examined in 164  internationally adopted children who had experienced varying degrees of  preadoption deprivation. Duration of institutional care, age at adoption, and  parent ratings of preadoption neglect indexed a latent factor of Deprived Care.  Adoption measures of height and weight standardized to World Health Organisation  norms indexed a latent factor of Growth Delay that was viewed as another  reflection of deprivation. Cortisol samples were collected 3.3-11.6 years  postadoption (Md = 7.3 years) at home on 3 days approximately 30 min after  wakeup and before bedtime. Both early a.m. levels and the decrease in cortisol  across the day were examined. A structural equation model revealed that  preadoption Deprived Care predicted Growth Delay at adoption and Growth Delay  predicted higher morning cortisol levels and a larger diurnal cortisol decrease.

Brendgen M(1), Boivin M, Vitaro F, Girard A, Dionne G, Pérusse D.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Québec at Montreal, CP 8888, Succ.  Centreville, Montréal, Québec H3C 3P8, Canada. Brendgen.Mara@uqam.ca	Although peer victimization places children at serious risk for aggressive  behavior, not all victimized children are aggressive. The diathesis-stress  hypothesis of disease proposes that an environmental stressor such as peer  victimization should to lead to maladjustment mostly in those individuals with  preexisting genetic vulnerabilities. Accordingly, this study examined whether  the link between peer victimization and child aggression is moderated by  children's genetic risk for such behavior. Using a sample of 506 6-year-old  twins, peer victimization was assessed through peer nominations and aggressive  behavior was assessed through peer and teacher reports. Children's genetic risk  for aggression was estimated as a function of their co-twin's aggression and the  pair's zygosity. Genetic modeling showed that peer victimization is an  environmentally driven variable that is unrelated to children's genetic  disposition. Results also provided support for the notion of a gene-environment  interaction between peer victimization and child's genetic risk for aggressive  behavior, albeit only in girls. For boys, peer victimization was related to  aggression regardless of the child's genetic risk for such behavior. Different  socialization experiences in girls' compared to boys' peer groups may explain  the different pattern of results for girls and boys.

Fernald LC(1), Burke HM, Gunnar MR.	Author information: (1)University of California, Berkeley, 50 University Hall, MC 7360, Berkeley,  CA94720-7360, USA. fernald@berkeley.edu	Children (N = 324 boys, 315 girls) between the ages of 2.5 and 6 (mean age =  3.63) were identified in a house to house survey in low-income areas (income  <20th percentile nationally) of urban Mexico. The Center for Epidemiologic  Studies-Depression Scale was administered to mothers of all children. Salivary  cortisol samples were taken in children as a measure of  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system activity at time of arrival  (baseline, Time 0), 25 min after arrival (Time 1), and 50 min after arrival  (Time 2). Between Time 0 and Time 1, children were administered several  cognitive tests. Results of hierarchical linear modeling analyses revealed that  higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms were associated with lower  baseline cortisol levels in their children (p < .05), while controlling for age,  gender, and time since awakening. Higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms  were associated with less of an increase in salivary cortisol to the arrival of  the experimenters and subsequent cognitive testing (p < .05). All results were  moderated by gender, with enhanced cortisol response in girls and no response in  boys. These results suggest that among very low-income families, high maternal  depressive symptoms are associated with hypoactivity of the HPA system in  children, particularly boys.

Mun EY(1), Windle M, Schainker LM.	Author information: (1)Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USAeymun@rci.rutgers.edu.	Data from a community-based sample of 1,126 10th- and 11th-grade adolescents  were analyzed using a model-based cluster analysis approach to empirically  identify heterogeneous adolescent subpopulations from the person-oriented and  pattern-oriented perspectives. The model-based cluster analysis is a new  clustering procedure to investigate population heterogeneity utilizing finite  mixture multivariate normal densities and accordingly to classify subpopulations  using more rigorous statistical procedures for the comparison of alternative  models. Four cluster groups were identified and labeled multiproblem high-risk,  smoking high-risk, normative, and low-risk groups. The multiproblem high risk  exhibited a constellation of high levels of problem behaviors, including  delinquent and sexual behaviors, multiple illicit substance use, and depressive  symptoms at age 16. They had risky temperamental attributes and lower academic  functioning and educational expectations at age 15.5 and, subsequently, at age  24 completed fewer years of education, and reported lower levels of physical  health and higher levels of continued involvement in substance use and abuse.  The smoking high-risk group was also found to be at risk for poorer functioning  in young adulthood, compared to the low-risk group. The normative and the low  risk groups were, by and large, similar in their adolescent and young adult  functioning. The continuity and comorbidity path from middle adolescence to  young adulthood may be aided and abetted by chronic as well as episodic  substance use by adolescents.

Keller PS(1), Cummings EM, Davies PT, Mitchell PM.	Author information: (1)University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA.	Relations between maternal and paternal problem drinking symptoms and  destructive marital conflict, parenting problems, and children's internalizing  and externalizing problems were investigated. Participants were community  families with a child in kindergarten who completed questionnaire measures at  baseline (N=235), 1 year later (N=227), and 2 years later (N=215). Structural  equation modeling revealed that paternal problem drinking at Time 1 was  associated with greater destructive marital conflict 1 year later. In turn,  destructive marital conflict was related to decreased parental warmth and  increased parental psychological control; these parenting problems were  associated with greater child internalizing and externalizing problems at the  third time point. Further analyses revealed that the indirect effects of  paternal drinking on children's adjustment were significant, and that relations  remained even after including autoregressive effects. Findings are discussed in  terms of family process models for relations between parental drinking and child  adjustment problems.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579408000096 PMID: 18211734 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Young children's representations of conflict and distress: a longitudinal study  of boys and girls with disruptive behavior problems.	Zahn-Waxler C(1), Park JH, Usher B, Belouad F, Cole P, Gruber R.	Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA. czahnwaxler@wisc.edu	We investigated narratives, symbolic play, and emotions in children who varied  in severity of disruptive behavior problems. Children's representations of  hypothetical situations of conflict and distress were assessed at 4-5 and 7  years. Behavior problems also were assessed then and again at 9 years.  Children's aggressive and caring themes differentiated nonproblem children,  children whose problems remained or worsened with age, and those whose problems  improved over time. Differences in boys and girls whose problems continued  sometimes reflected exaggerations of prototypic gender differences seen across  the groups. Boys with problems showed more hostile themes (physical aggression  and anger), whereas girls with problems showed more caring (prosocial) themes  relative to the other groups. Modulated (verbal) aggression, more common in  girls than boys, showed developmentally appropriate increases with age. However,  this was true only for children without problems and those whose problems  improved. We consider how these findings contribute to an understanding the  inner worlds of boys and girls who differ in their early developmental  trajectories for behavior problems.

Järvinen-Pasley A(1), Bellugi U, Reilly J, Mills DL, Galaburda A, Reiss AL,  Korenberg JR.	Author information: (1)Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037-1099, USA.	Research into phenotype-genotype correlations in neurodevelopmental disorders  has greatly elucidated the contribution of genetic and neurobiological factors  to variations in typical and atypical development. Etiologically relatively  homogeneous disorders, such as Williams syndrome (WS), provide unique  opportunities for elucidating gene-brain-behavior relationships. WS is a  neurogenetic disorder caused by a hemizygous deletion of approximately 25 genes  on chromosome 7q11.23. This results in a cascade of physical,  cognitive-behavioral, affective, and neurobiological aberrations. WS is  associated with a markedly uneven neurocognitive profile, and the mature state  cognitive profile of WS is relatively well developed. Although anecdotally,  individuals with WS have been frequently described as unusually friendly and  sociable, personality remains a considerably less well studied area. This paper  investigates genetic influences, cognitive-behavioral characteristics,  aberrations in brain structure and function, and environmental and biological  variables that influence the social outcomes of individuals with WS. We bring  together a series of findings across multiple levels of scientific enquiry to  examine the social phenotype in WS, reflecting the journey from gene to the  brain to behavior. Understanding the complex multilevel scientific perspective  in WS has implications for understanding typical social development by  identifying important developmental events and markers, as well as helping to  define the boundaries of psychopathology.

Socioeconomic status mediates the genetic contribution of the dopamine receptor  D4 and serotonin transporter linked promoter region repeat polymorphisms to  externalization in preadolescence.

Author information: (1)Child Psychiatry Department, Eugenio Medea Scientific Institute, via Don  Luigi Monza 20, Bosisio Parini 23842 (LC), Italy. mnobile@bp.lnf.it	The impact of socioeconomic status (SES) and genetic polymorphisms on individual  differences for externalized behaviors have often been investigated separately  in studies of children and adults. In a general population sample of 607 Italian  preadolescents, we examined the independent and joint effects of SES and the  dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) and serotonin transporter linked promoter region  (5-HTTLPR) polymorphisms upon rule-breaking and aggressive behaviors measured  with the Child Behavior CheckList/6-18. We found evidence, which was based on  both one locus and two-loci genotype analyses, that low SES and DRD4 long and  5-HTTLPR long alleles, both alone and in interaction, are associated with higher  aggressive behavior scores. The effects were similar but more modest and limited  to one locus genotype analyses for rule-breaking behavior. Consistent with  studies that showed the effects of societal moderators on the heritability of  externalized behaviors across different segments of the population, we suggest  that diminished social constraints associated with low parental SES may act as  enhancers of the genetic influence of specific DRD4 and 5-HTTLPR alleles over  aggressive behaviors in preadolescence.

Gene-environment interactions reexamined: does mother's marital stability  interact with the dopamine receptor D2 gene in the etiology of childhood  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder?	Waldman ID(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Emory University, 532 North Kilgo Circle, Atlanta,  GA 30322, USA. psyiw@emory.edu	Potential candidate Gene x Environment interactions in the etiology of childhood  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are examined between the  dopamine receptor D2 gene (DRD2) and putative family environmental risk factors  that reflect mothers' marital stability. Specifically, interactions were tested  between DRD2 and mothers' marital status, number of marriages or cohabiting  relationships, and age at first marriage. Moderate relations were found among  the marital stability measures, and mother's marital status and number of  marriages or cohabiting relationships (but not age at first marriage) were risk  factors for their children's ADHD. All three mother's marital stability  variables were associated with either the child's or mother's DRD2 genotypes.  Gene x Environment interactions were found for children's ADHD diagnoses between  children's DRD2 genotypes and mother's marital status and number of marriages or  cohabiting relationships. It is of interest that these interactions were  strengthened with the progressive addition of sets of covariates intended to  control for alternative causal pathways that represent background genetic and  environmental context confounds. The present findings highlight the importance  of considering both the nexus of putative environmental risk factors and whether  their etiology and effects are truly environmental in future Gene x Environment  interaction research.

Author information: (1)Austen Riggs Center, 25 Main Street, PO Box 962, Stockbridge, MA 01262-0962,  USA. david.reiss@austenriggs.net	The rapidly moving study of Gene x Environment interaction (G x E) needs interim  conceptual tools to track progress, integrate findings, and apply this knowledge  to preventive intervention. We define two closely related concepts: the social  mediation of the expression of genetic influences and the interaction between  the entire genotype and the social environment (G x E). G x E, the primary focus  of this report, assesses individual differences in the full genotype using twin,  sibling, and adoption designs and, for the most part, employs fine-grained  analyses of relational processes in the social environment. In comparison,  studies of Allele x Environment interaction assess the influence on development  of one or more measured polymorphisms as modified by environmental factors. G x  E studies build on work showing how the social environment responds to genetic  influences and how genetic influences shape the social environment. Recent G x E  research has yielded new insight into variations in the sensitivity of the  social environment to genotypic influences and provides clues to the specificity  and timing of these environmental responses that can be leveraged to inform  preventive interventions aimed at reducing genetic risk for problem behavior.

Association between the recombinant human serotonin transporter linked promoter  region polymorphism and behavior in rhesus macaques during a separation  paradigm.

Author information: (1)National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIH Animal Center, P.O.  Box 529, Poolesville, MD 20837, USA.	Human studies have suggested an association between a variable length  polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene promoter region and vulnerability  to anxiety and depression. Relative to the long (l) allele, the short (s) allele  increases the risk of developing depression in individuals exposed to stressful  life events. An orthologue of the human variant is present in rhesus macaques  and allows for studies in animals exposed to stress. Here, we used an  established model of early life stress exposure, in which rhesus macaques are  raised without adults in a group of peers (peer-only reared [PR]), or with their  mothers. At 6 months of age, animals were subjected to 4-day long social  separations for 4 consecutive weeks, with 3 days of reunion in between. Data  were collected during both the acute (Day 1) and chronic phases (Days 2-4) of  separation. Behavioral factors were separately extracted for each phase of  separation. For acute separation, the behavioral factors generated were despair  and behavioral pathology and, for the chronic phase despair, agitation, and  behavioral pathology. During both phases of social separation, PR l/s animals  were more likely to exhibit pathological behaviors, whereas PR l/l monkeys show  higher levels of despair compared to the other three groups. These findings  indicate that early stress affects the behavioral response to separation  differently as a function of recombinant human serotonin transporter linked  polymorphic repeat genotype and suggest that carriers of the s allele are not  only more anxious but may also be more vulnerable to developing behavioral  pathology in the face of chronic adversity.

Emotion and resilience: a multilevel investigation of hemispheric  electroencephalogram asymmetry and emotion regulation in maltreated and  nonmaltreated children.	Curtis WJ(1), Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14608, USA.  wjcurtis@psych.rochester.edu	The current study was a multilevel investigation of resilience, emotion  regulation, and hemispheric electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry in a sample of  maltreated and nonmaltreated school age children. It was predicted that the  positive emotionality and increased emotion regulatory ability associated with  resilient functioning would be associated with relatively greater left frontal  EEG activity. The study also investigated differences in pathways to resilience  between maltreated and nonmaltreated children. The findings indicated that EEG  asymmetry across central cortical regions distinguished between resilient and  nonresilient children, with greater left hemisphere activity characterizing  those who were resilient. In addition, nonmaltreated children showed greater  left hemisphere EEG activity across parietal cortical regions. There was also a  significant interaction between resilience, maltreatment status, and gender for  asymmetry at anterior frontal electrodes, where nonmaltreated resilient females  had greater relative left frontal activity compared to more right frontal  activity exhibited by resilient maltreated females. An observational measure of  emotion regulation significantly contributed to the prediction of resilience in  the maltreated and nonmaltreated children, but EEG asymmetry in central cortical  regions independently predicted resilience only in the maltreated group. The  findings are discussed in terms of their meaning for the development of  resilient functioning.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579407000405 PMID: 17705904 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA. kdegnan@umd.edu	Behavioral inhibition is reported to be one of the most stable temperamental  characteristics in childhood. However, there is also evidence for discontinuity  of this trait, with infants and toddlers who were extremely inhibited displaying  less withdrawn social behavior as school-age children or adolescents. There are  many possible explanations for the discontinuity in this temperament over time.  They include the development of adaptive attention and regulatory skills, the  influence of particular styles of parenting or caregiving contexts, and  individual characteristics of the child such as their level of  approach-withdrawal motivation or their gender. These discontinuous trajectories  of behaviorally inhibited children and the factors that form them are discussed  as examples of the resilience process.

Author information: (1)The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown, Rhode Island, USA.  stephen_sheinkopf@brown.edu	Studies have investigated the potential effects of prenatal cocaine exposure  (CE) on children's development. However, few studies have examined predictors of  resilient outcomes in this population. We examined vagal tone (VT) as a  resilience factor in prenatal CE. Utilizing data from the Maternal Lifestyle  Study, a cumulative risk index was derived for children with and without  prenatal CE. Presence of CE and other prenatal drugs was summed with postnatal  risks in infancy to yield a 15-item risk index. Preschool cognitive outcomes,  problem behaviors, and adaptive behaviors were measured. VT was assessed during  an infant exam at 1 month and toy exploration at 36 months. We included children  with complete physiologic data (217 CE, 333 non-CE). Children were classified as  having consistently high, consistently low, or fluctuating VT at 1 and 36  months. Children were also classified as high versus low risk. High-risk  children had lower IQ scores, more problem behaviors, and lower ratings of  adaptive behaviors than low-risk children. A significant risk by VT-stability  interaction indicated that for high-risk children, those with stable low VT had  higher ratings of adaptive behaviors at 36 months. This is consistent with  theory linking reduced VT during tasks to adaptive regulation and indicates that  such regulatory functioning may serve as a protective factor in prenatal CE.

High  levels of developmental risks were reported, with levels and types of risks  varying by gender, age, and (to a lesser extent) race. Associations between  levels of risks in the various domains and indicators of psychological (e.g.,  self-esteem, negative emotionality) and behavioral (e.g., substance use)  adjustment differed for male and female respondents. Findings build on prior  research investigating the development of young people in conditions of  pervasive urban poverty and reinforce the value of international research in  this endeavor.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University Medical Center, Groningen, The  Netherlands. a.j.oldehinkel@med.umcg.nl	This study examined the extent to which effortful control moderated the risk of  internalizing or externalizing problems associated with high negative  emotionality in a Dutch population sample of pre- and early adolescents (N =  1,922). Internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed with the Child  Behavior Checklist, Youth Self-Report, and Teacher Checklist of Psychopathology.  Temperament (effortful control, fearfulness, frustration) was assessed with the  parent version of the Revised Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire. The  effects of fearfulness and frustration appeared to be attenuated by high levels  of effortful control. The associations differed between the two domains of  mental health investigated: effortful control reduced the effect of fearfulness  on internalizing problems and the effect of frustration on externalizing  problems. The effects were stronger for externalizing problems and similar for  preadolescent (age 11) and adolescent (age 13/14) outcomes.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579407070253 PMID: 17459182 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

A comparison of selective attention and facial processing biases in typically  developing children who are high and low in self-reported trait anxiety.	Richards A(1), French CC, Nash G, Hadwin JA, Donnelly N.	Author information: (1)School of Psychology, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK.  a.richards@bbk.ac.uk	The relationship between children's anxiety and cognitive biases was examined in  two tasks. A group of 50 children aged 10 to 11 years (mean = 11 years, SD =  3.71 months) was given two tasks. The first tested children's selective  attention (SA) to threat in an emotional Stroop task. The second explored facial  processing biases using morphed angry-neutral and happy-neutral emotional  expressions that varied in intensity. Faces with varying levels of emotion (25%  emotion-75% neutral, 50% emotion-50% neutral, 100% emotion-0% neutral  [prototype] and 150% emotion-0% neutral [caricature]) were judged as being angry  or happy. Results support previous work highlighting a link between anxiety and  SA to threat. In addition, increased anxiety in late childhood is associated  with decreased ability to discriminate facial expression. Finally, lack of  discrimination in the emotional expression task was related to lack of  inhibition to threat in the Stroop task.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457940707023X PMID: 17459180 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Health and Tavistock Clinic, University College London,  London, UK. jessica.meyer@ucl.ac.uk	In this paper we outline our hypothesis that human intersubjective engagement  entails identifying with other people. We tested a prediction derived from this  hypothesis that concerned the relation between a component of joint attention  and a specific form of imitation. The empirical investigation involved "blind"  ratings of videotapes from a recent study in which we tested matched children  with and without autism for their propensity to imitate the  self-/other-orientated aspects of another person's actions. The results were in  keeping with three a priori predictions, as follows: (a) children with autism  contrasted with control participants in spending more time looking at the  objects acted upon and less time looking at the tester; (b) participants with  autism showed fewer "sharing" looks toward the tester, and although they also  showed fewer "checking" and "orientating" looks, they were specifically less  likely to show any sharing looks; and, critically, (c) within each group,  individual differences in sharing looks (only) were associated with imitation of  self-other orientation. We suggest that the propensity to adopt the bodily  anchored psychological stance of another person is essential to certain forms of  joint attention and imitation, and that a weak tendency to identify with others  is pivotal for the developmental psychopathology of autism.

Bender HL(1), Allen JP, McElhaney KB, Antonishak J, Moore CM, Kelly HO, Davis  SM.	Author information: (1)University of Virginia, USA. hbender@commonwealthcounseling.com	A history of exposure to harsh physical discipline has been linked to negative  outcomes for children, ranging from conduct disorder to depression and low  self-esteem. The present study extends this work into adolescence, and examines  the relationship of lifetime histories of harsh discipline to adolescents'  internalizing and externalizing symptoms and to their developing capacities for  establishing autonomy and relatedness in family interactions. Adolescent and  parent reports of harsh discipline, independently coded observations of  conflictual interactions, and adolescent reports of symptoms were obtained for  141 adolescents at age 16. Both parents' use of harsh discipline was related to  greater adolescent depression and externalizing behavior, even when these  effects were examined over and above the effects of other parenting measures  known to account for these symptoms. Adolescents exposed to harsh discipline  from mothers were also less likely to appear warm and engaged during an  interaction task with their mothers. It is suggested that a history of harsh  discipline is associated not only with social and emotional functioning, but  also with the developmental task of autonomy and relatedness.

Gunnar MR(1), van Dulmen MH; International Adoption Project Team.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, 51 East River Road, University of Minnesota,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. gunnar@umn.edu	Using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the rate and type of behavior  problems associated with being reared in an institution prior to adoption were  examined in 1,948, 4- through 18-year-old internationally adopted children, 899  of whom had experienced prolonged institutional care prior to adoption. The  children's adoptions were decreed between 1990 and 1998 in Minnesota. Binomial  logistic regression analyses revealed that early institutional rearing was  associated with increased rates of attention and social problems, but not  problems in either the internalizing or externalizing domains. Independent of  institutional history, children who were adopted >or=24 months had higher rates  of behavior problems across many CBCL scales, including internalizing and  externalizing problems. In general, time in the adoptive home, which also  reflected age at testing, was positively associated with rates of problem  behavior. Thus, there was little evidence that the likelihood of behavior  problems wane with time postadoption. Finally, children adopted from  Russia/Eastern Europe appeared at greater risk of developing behavior problems  in several domains compared to children adopted from other areas of the world.

Wolfe St.,  Baltimore, MD 21287-3325, USA. bruck@welch.jhu.edu	Two paradigms were developed to examine autobiographical memory (ABM) and  suggestibility in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children with  ASD (N = 30) and typically developing chronological age-matched children (N =  38) ranging in age from 5 to 10 years were administered an ABM questionnaire.  Children were asked about details of current and past personally experienced  events. Children also participated in a staged event, and later were provided  with true and false reminders about that event. Later, children again were  interviewed about the staged event. The results from both paradigms revealed  that children with ASD showed poorer ABM compared to controls. Generally, their  ABM was marked by errors of omission rather than by errors of commission, and  memory was particularly poor for early-life events. In addition, they were as  suggestible as the typically developing children. The results are discussed in  terms of applied and theoretical implications.

Viding E(1), Williamson DE, Hariri AR.	Author information: (1)University College London.	Advances in molecular biology, neuroimaging, genetic epidemiology, and  developmental psychopathology have provided a unique opportunity to explore the  interplay of genes, brain, and behavior within a translational research  framework. Herein, we begin by outlining an experimental strategy by which  genetic effects on brain function can be explored using neuroimaging, namely,  imaging genetics. We next describe some major findings in imaging genetics to  highlight the effectiveness of this strategy for delineating biological pathways  and mechanisms by which individual differences in brain function emerge and  potentially bias behavior and risk for psychiatric illness. We then discuss the  importance of applying imaging genetics to the study of psychopathology within a  developmental framework. By beginning to move toward a systems-level approach to  understanding pathways to behavioral outcomes as they are expressed across  development, it is anticipated that we will move closer to understanding the  complexities of the specific mechanisms involved in the etiology of psychiatric  disease. Despite the numerous challenges that lie ahead, we believe that  developmental imaging genetics has potential to yield highly informative results  that will ultimately translate into public health benefits. We attempt to set  out guidelines and provide exemplars that may help in designing fruitful  translational research applications that incorporate a developmental imaging  genetics strategy.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.  angus@umn.edu	Schizophrenia has long been approached from a translational perspective;  however, new findings from the past decade have radically affected the dominant  accounts of this illness. It is now possible to derive a consistent account of  one contributing cause of schizophrenia across multiple levels of analysis, from  genes to receptors, functional neuroanatomy, cognition, and symptoms. To this  end, we summarize the data attributing the disorganization symptoms of  schizophrenia to a failure of executive, prefrontal cortical processes. We  describe the hypothesis that this failure reflects an impairment in  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic neurotransmission, that is likely to  involve both the dysregulated function of NMDA synapses, as well as the physical  loss of NMDA synapses, particularly in prefrontal cortex. Dysregulation in NMDA  synaptic function can be in turn attributed to polymorphisms in a variety of  genes (regulator of G-protein signaling 4, dystrobrevin binding protein I,  neuregulin-1, D-amino acid oxidase activator, and others) that have been linked  to schizophrenia and are likely to impact NMDA-mediated synaptic  neuroplasticity. Although the science of schizophrenia is not yet at a point  where any domain or set of findings provides strong constraints across other  levels of analysis, the further development of evidence for this chain of  causation can provide increasingly strong tests of the NMDA synapse deficit  theory.

Author information: (1)Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02215, USA.  marjorie.beeghly@childrens.harvard.edu	There is a pressing need for the early and accurate identification of young  children at risk for language and other developmental disabilities and the  provision of timely, age-appropriate intervention, as mandated by Part C of the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Research has shown that early  intervention is effective for many language impaired children in different  etiological groups, and can reduce the functional impact of persistent disorders  on children and their families. Yet, the accurate identification of infants and  toddlers at risk for language impairment remains elusive, especially for  late-talking children without obvious genetic or neurological conditions. In  this paper, the need for translational research on basic processes in early  language development in typical and atypical populations and the contextual  factors that affect them are discussed, along with current challenges and future  directions for its successful implementation. Implications of this research for  clinical evidence-based practice are also considered.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579406060366 PMCID: PMC3135267 PMID: 17152398 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Birmaher B(1), Axelson D.	Author information: (1)Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical  Center, PA 15213, USA. birmaherb@upmc.edu	The longitudinal course of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder (BP)  is manifested by frequent changes in symptom polarity with a fluctuating course  showing a dimensional continuum of bipolar symptom severity from subsyndromal to  mood syndromes meeting full Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental  Disorders criteria. These rapid fluctuations in mood appear to be more  accentuated than in adults with BP, and combined with the high rate of comorbid  disorders and the child's cognitive and emotional developmental stage, may  explain the difficulties encountered diagnosing and treating BP youth. Children  and adolescents with early-onset, low socioeconomic status, subsyndromal mood  symptoms, long duration of illness, rapid mood fluctuation, mixed presentations,  psychosis, comorbid disorders, and family psychopathology appear to have worse  longitudinal outcome. BP in children and adolescents is associated with high  rates of hospitalizations, psychosis, suicidal behaviors, substance abuse,  family and legal problems, as well as poor psychosocial functioning. These  factors, in addition to the enduring and rapid changeability of symptoms of this  illness from very early in life, and at crucial stages in their lives, deprive  BP children of the opportunity for normal psychosocial development. Thus, early  recognition and treatment of BP in children and adolescents is of utmost  importance.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579406060500 PMID: 17064427 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Adolescent Cluster A personality disorder symptoms, role assumption in the  transition to adulthood, and resolution or persistence of symptoms.	Cohen P(1), Chen H, Kasen S, Johnson JG, Crawford T, Gordon K.	Author information: (1)Unit 47, New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, New  York, NY 10032, USA.	Cluster A odd or eccentric personality disorder (PD) symptoms may reflect a  schizophrenia spectrum biological vulnerability in at least some persons.  Consequently, this symptom pattern may have particularly negative effects on the  transition from adolescent to adult roles. A general population sample of 200  young adults was assessed on Cluster A PD at mean ages 17 and 22, and  subsequently provided detailed narratives about their monthly experiences and  behaviors between these two ages. Adolescent Cluster A PD was related to the  developmental trajectories of residential, career, financial, romantic, and  family formation roles during this period, and trajectories were related to a  change in symptoms over this period. Symptoms were associated with early  parenthood and less advanced education, but for other developmental outcomes  tended to differ for men and women. These gender differences were attributable,  in part, to the differential meaning and consequences of early parenthood for  men and women.

Author information: (1)Tavistock Clinic, London, UK.	There is controversy over the existence and nature of blind children's  limitations in symbolic play. In this study we tested 13 5- to 9-year-old  congenitally blind children for the ability to symbolize when an adult provided  scaffolding for their play. The blind children were selected on the basis that  they did not have the syndrome of autism, and they comprised two groups matched  for age (MA) and verbal ability on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children  who contrasted in their ability to engage in social relations. We also tested a  group of sighted children who were MA matched with the more socially able blind  children. On the basis of an hypothesis about the social-developmental sources  of symbolic play deficits in congenitally blind children, we predicted  differences between the socially able and socially impaired groups of blind  children in the following respects: the attribution of symbolic meanings to play  materials, the ascription of individual roles to play figures, and the anchorage  of play in the scenario as presented by the adult. The results accorded with  these predictions. Whereas the more socially able blind children showed symbolic  play that was very similar to that of sighted children, the MA- and IQ-matched  socially impaired blind children were limited in the three aspects of their  play. On the other hand, even the socially impaired children showed instances of  symbolizing. The findings suggest a way to reconcile conflicting reports of  symbolic play deficits in young blind children, and may be relevant for  explaining the association between autism and congenital blindness.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Box 34, Wichita State University, Wichita, KS  67260-0034, USA. james.snyder@wichita.edu	The relationships of deviant talk and role taking during peer interaction,  association with deviant peers, and growth in overt and covert conduct problems  during kindergarten and first grade were examined in a community sample of 267  boys and girls. At entry to kindergarten, high levels of overt and covert  conduct problems predicted association with deviant peers, and deviant peer  association predicted deviant talk and role taking during peer interaction  during kindergarten. Association with deviant peers, and deviant talk and role  taking predicted growth in overt and covert conduct problems on the playground,  in the classroom, and at home during kindergarten and first grade. Peer  processes associated with growth in conduct problems that escalate rapidly  during late childhood and adolescence appear to occur in earlier childhood.  These peer processes may play a central role in the evolution of conduct  problems to include covert as well as overt forms.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579405050194 PMID: 16761551 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

We find that exposure  to violence and maternal life stress are each predictive of child behavior  problems, and that the impact of maternal life stress on child behavior problems  is mediated by maternal psychopathology and the quality of the mother-child  relationship.

Author information: (1)University of Chicago, School of Social Service Administration, 969 East 60th  Street, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. tkeller@uchicago.edu	A small proportion of children exhibit extreme and persistent conduct problems  through childhood. The present study employed the multiple-domain model of  Greenberg and colleagues as the framework for person-oriented analyses examining  whether parent-child attachment combines with parenting, family ecology, and  child characteristics in particular configurations of risk that are linked to  this problematic developmental pathway. Using prospective data from a community  sample of adolescent mothers and their children, latent variable growth mixture  modeling identified a normative trajectory with declining problem behaviors  during the preschool period. Consistent with research on early-starter pathways,  a distinct group of children featured a higher intercept and a positive slope,  indicating an escalation in disruptive behaviors. Attachment security played a  role in defining specific risk profiles associated with the probability of  exhibiting this problem trajectory. Given particular patterns of risk exposure,  secure attachment served a protective function. Avoidant, but not disorganized,  attachment was associated with significantly higher likelihood of the disruptive  problem trajectory. The results also indicated the general accumulation of risk  was detrimental, but the particular configuration of risk made a difference.  Overall, the findings suggest early attachment operates in conjunction with  personal and contextual risk to distinguish the development of later problem  behaviors.

Hobson RP(1), Patrick M, Crandell L, García-Pérez R, Lee A.	Author information: (1)Tavistock Clinic, University College, London, UK. r.hobson@ucl.ac.uk	The principal aim of this study was to assess personal relatedness and  attachment patterns in 12-month-old infants of mothers with borderline  personality disorder (BPD). We also evaluated maternal intrusive insensitivity  toward the infants in semistructured play. We videotaped 10 mother-infant dyads  with borderline mothers and 22 dyads where the mothers were free from  psychopathology, in three different settings: a modification of Winnicott's Set  Situation in which infants faced an initially unresponsive ("still-face")  stranger, who subsequently tried to engage the infant in a game of give and  take; the Strange Situation of Ainsworth and Wittig; and a situation in which  mothers were requested to teach their infants to play with miniature figures and  a toy train. In relation to a set of a priori predictions, the results revealed  significant group differences as follows: (a) compared with control infants,  toward the stranger the infants of mothers with BPD showed lower levels of  "availability for positive engagement," lower ratings of "behavior organization  and mood state," and a lower proportion of interpersonally directed looks that  were positive; (b) in the Strange Situation, a higher proportion (8 out of 10)  of infants of borderline mothers were categorized as Disorganized; and (c) in  play, mothers with BPD were rated as more "intrusively insensitive" toward their  infants. The results are discussed in relation to hypotheses concerning the  interpersonal relations of women with BPD, and possible implications for their  infants' development.

This article provides a contemporary view of the psychodynamics of borderline  personality disorder (BPD) from a developmental psychopathology perspective. We  first briefly describe the evolution of the borderline construct in  psychoanalysis and psychiatry. Then we provide clinically and empirically  informed model of domains of personality function and dysfunction that provides  a roadmap for thinking about personality pathology from a developmental  psychopathology standpoint and examine the nature and phenomenology of BPD in  terms of these domains of functioning. Next, we describe prominent dynamic  theories of etiology of BPD and examine these in relation to the available  research. Finally, we describe psychodynamic conceptions of treatment and the  way BPD phenomena manifest in treatment, followed again by consideration of  relevant research, particularly on transference-countertransference  constellations empirically identified in the treatment of patients with BPD.

Author information: (1)National Center for PTSD, Boston, USA.	We review the role of emotion regulation in borderline personality disorder  (BPD). We briefly discuss the historical development of BPD as a disorder where  emotional regulation plays a key role. We review the concept of emotion  regulation in general and explore both one-factor and two-factor models of  emotion regulation. We discuss cognitive and attentional aspects of emotion  regulation, and explore these regulatory controls as operating as both voluntary  as well as automatic processes. We then turn to other neurophysiological models  of emotion regulation in general and examine how those models, both  neurophysiologically and neuroanatomically, are expressed in individuals with  BPD. We examine how neuroimaging, both anatomical and functional, reveals the  roles that various neuroanatomical structures play in the regulation of emotion  in BPD. We conclude by creating a neurodevelopmental model that describes how a  complex matrix involving the interplay of constitutional/biological  predispositions with environmental stressors as well as with parental  effectiveness in response to the child's emotion expression can impact key  aspects of adult cognitive, affective, interpersonal, and behavioral functioning  that culminate in a diagnosis of BPD.

Bosquet M(1), Egeland B.	Author information: (1)Boston Medical Center, Boston University School of Medicine, USA.	This study examined the etiology and course of anxiety symptoms from infancy  through adolescence in a longitudinal high-risk community sample. One hundred  fifty-five subjects were assessed using a variety of observational, projective,  and objective measures. Results of path analyses revealed the following: (a)  anxiety symptoms showed moderate stability during childhood and adolescence; (b)  heightened neonatal biobehavioral reactivity and poor regulation predicted  emotion regulation difficulties in preschool, which predicted anxiety symptoms  in childhood; (c) developmental incompetence in childhood predicted anxiety  symptoms in preadolescence, and anxiety symptoms in preadolescence predicted  incompetence in adolescence; (d) insecure attachment relationships in infancy  predicted negative peer relationship representations in preadolescence, and  these representations predicted anxiety symptoms in adolescence; (e) compared to  males, females showed similar rates of anxiety symptoms in childhood but greater  and more stable rates in adolescence; however, males and females showed similar  patterns of association between risk factors and anxiety symptoms across  childhood and adolescence; and (f) the model tested was specific in predicting  anxiety symptoms and not psychopathology in general. The results support a  developmental model of the etiology and maintenance of anxiety symptoms in  childhood and highlight factors to consider in efforts to prevent and treat  childhood anxiety.

Hayden EP(1), Klein DN, Durbin CE, Olino TM.	Author information: (1)State University of New York at Stony Brook, NY, USA. ehayden@uwo.ca	This study examined associations between temperament at age 3 and depressotypic  cognitive styles at age 7 in a community sample of children. Sixty-four  preschool aged children were assessed for positive emotionality (PE) and  negative emotionality (NE) using a standardized battery of laboratory tasks and  naturalistic home observations. At follow-up 4 years later, the children  completed laboratory tasks designed to tap helplessness in social and  problem-solving situations, positive and negative information-processing biases,  and self-reports of attributional style. Lower PE at age 3 predicted greater  helplessness in the interpersonal task and decreased positive schematic  processing. There was little evidence for a relationship between NE and  depressotypic cognitive styles. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis  that some portion of cognitive vulnerability to depression may stem from  early-emerging differences in the expression of positive emotions.

Author information: (1)Human and Developmental Family Sciences, University of Texas at Austin,  Austin, TX 78712, USA. debj@mail.utexas.edu	This prospective, longitudinal study explored the relationship between mothers  unresolved/disorganized (U/d) attachment status and frightened/frightening (FR)  maternal behavior and investigated possible variations due to whether mothers  were U/d for loss versus abuse. The role of other factors that might predict  maternal FR behavior was also examined. Pregnant women (n = 116) were  administered the Adult Attachment Interview and later observed at home for 30-40  min interacting with their first-born 8-month-olds. Women classified as U/d with  respect to loss and/or abuse displayed substantially higher levels of FR  behavior with their infants than did mothers who were not classified as U/d  (i.e., secure/autonomous, dismissing, or preoccupied), but these groups did not  differ on maternal sensitivity. Mothers classified as U/d who had a secondary  secure/autonomous classification also showed FR behavior but at low levels than  U/d-insecure mothers. Independent of U/d status, mothers who had lost a parent,  versus those who did not, more often displayed FR behavior with their infants.  Finally, U/d loss fully mediated the association between loss of an attachment  figure other than the parent and FR behavior, and partially mediated the  relationship between loss of a parent and FR behavior.

Examining the role of parental frightened/frightening subtypes in predicting  disorganized attachment within a brief observational procedure.	Abrams KY(1), Rifkin A, Hesse E.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.	Following Main and Hesse's hypothesis, several investigators have affirmed that  frightened/frightening (FR) as well as particular atypical maternal behaviors  are associated with infant disorganized and adult unresolved attachment. Here,  for the first time, FR behavior was observed in (a) middle-class father-infant  (n = 25) and independent mother-infant dyads (n = 50) and (b) a brief laboratory  play session. In addition, relations between disorganization, unresolved  attachment, and the six FR system subscales were explored. Paternal and maternal  overall FR behavior was related to infant disorganization (n = 75, phi = .61, p  < .001), and for a subsample where Adult Attachment Interviews were available (n  = 32), to unresolved adult attachment (phi = .59, p < .001). At the subscale  level, disorganized-FR behaviors were related to infant disorganization, but  only for mother-infant dyads. Across the whole sample, both dissociative-FR and  threatening-FR subscales were associated with infant disorganization. The  dissociative-FR subscale emerged as the central predictor of infant  disorganization and was the only subscale significantly related to unresolved  attachment. The appearance of FR behavior in this 18-min play procedure suggests  that FR probably occurs more frequently than previously suspected. The possible  role of dissociative processes in unresolved adult attachment, disorganized  attachment, and FR parental behavior is discussed.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, Wayne State University  School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48202, USA.	Elevated corticosterone levels to stress have been found in adult rats exposed  prenatally to alcohol, but little is known about the effects of prenatal alcohol  exposure on the cortisol response in humans. To date, one study has found that  crack/cocaine was related to depressed newborn cortisol levels following a heel  prick. In the present study saliva samples were obtained before and after a  blood draw from 83 inner-city African American 13-month-old infants exposed  prenatally to alcohol, cocaine, and other illicit drugs. Post-blood draw  cortisol levels did not differ from basal levels in many of the infants,  confirming recent studies indicating adaptation of the adrenocortical response  to this type of stress at this age. Maternal depression and emergence of teeth  were positively related to cortisol levels. Alcohol exposure was related to  elevated basal levels, cocaine to lower basal levels. As predicted from animal  findings, heavy alcohol exposure was related to elevated poststress cortisol  levels.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579499002011 PMID: 16506530 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)University of Canterbury & Christchurch School of Medicine, New Zealand.  lianne.woodward@canterbury.ac.nz	Data gathered over the course of a 25-year longitudinal study of 1,055 young  people was used to examine gender differences in the onset of early parenthood  and the developmental processes that place males and females at risk of becoming  a young parent. Results revealed clear gender differences in the timing of early  parenthood, with females being twice as likely as males to become a parent  between the ages of 16 and 25 years. In contrast, the risk factors and life  course processes that placed males and females at risk of an early transition to  parenthood were very similar. Two exceptions were a gender-specific effect for  maternal age and exposure to parental change, suggesting that having been raised  by a younger mother and having experienced parental changes in your family of  origin increased risks of early parenthood for females but not males. These  findings contribute to our understanding of the effects of gender on life course  development.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579406060159 PMID: 16478563 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.  trond.diseth@rikshospitalet.no	Chronic illnesses often involve repeated hospitalization and invasive treatment  procedures that can have a traumatic impact on child development. To explore  possible consequences of treatment procedures, three groups of patients with  congenital anomalies were examined longitudinally. At first admission,  adolescents (ages 10-20, mean 15) with anorectal anomalies (n = 14), adolescents  with Hirschsprung disease (n = 14), and hospitalized controls (n = 14) were  assessed for treatment procedures, somatic function, mental health, and  dissociative experiences. The assessment included the Adolescent Dissociative  Experiences Scale (A-DES). At 10-year follow-up, the patients completed the  Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) and the Somatoform Dissociative  Questionnaire (SDQ-20). Anal dilatation, an invasive medical treatment procedure  performed daily by the parents the first 4 years, was correlated with the  frequency and severity of persisting dissociative symptomatology. The procedure  was the only significant predictor of A-DES and SDQ-20 scores, and one of two  significant predictors of DES scores. This "experiment of nature" permitted a  specific and unique opportunity to examine the impact of early traumatic  exposure on child development in the absence of parental malevolence, and on  later dissociative outcome in adolescence and adulthood. The findings might be  valuable theoretically to our understanding of the development of  psychopathology, and may lend itself for comparison with data on sexually abused  children.

Crockett LJ(1), Moilanen KL, Raffaelli M, Randall BA.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, 238 Burnett Hall, University of Nebraska-Lincoln,  Lincoln, NE 68588-0308, USA. ecrockett1@unl.edu	The association between young adolescents' psychological profiles and their  subsequent adjustment was examined in a sample of 606 adolescents (ages 12-13)  drawn from the mother-child data set of the National Longitudinal Survey of  Youth. Cluster analysis was used to identify distinct groups of youth based on  self-regulation, proneness to risk, self-worth, and perceived academic  competence. Five replicable clusters were identified corresponding to optimal,  average, behavioral risk, low self-regulation, and emotional risk groups. These  clusters were associated with distinct patterns of adjustment 4 years later. At  ages 16-17, youth in the optimal group tended to report better academic  performance, less problem behavior, and less depression than youth in the three  risk groups; however, their functioning did not differ significantly from youth  in the average group. The three risk groups differed in self-reported depression  symptoms and academic performance but not in levels of problem behavior.  Differences among the five groups persisted when demographic and contextual  variables were controlled. These results support the existence of different  groups of youth who follow distinct developmental trajectories and may  experience different patterns of adjustment.

Meanings in motion and faces: developmental associations between the processing  of intention from geometrical animations and gaze detection accuracy.	Campbell R(1), Lawrence K, Mandy W, Mitra C, Jeyakuma L, Skuse D.	Author information: (1)Department of Human Communication Science, University College London, London  UK WC1 N1PF, UK. r.campbell@ucl.ac.uk	Aspects of face processing, on the one hand, and theory of mind (ToM) tasks, on  the other hand, show specific impairment in autism. We aimed to discover whether  a correlation between tasks tapping these abilities was evident in typically  developing children at two developmental stages. One hundred fifty-four normal  children (6-8 years and 16-18 years) and 13 high-IQ autistic children (11-17  years) were tested on a range of face-processing and IQ tasks, and a ToM test  based on the attribution of intentional movement to abstract shapes in a  cartoon. By midchildhood, the ability accurately and spontaneously to infer the  locus of attention of a face with direct or averted gaze was specifically  associated with the ability to describe geometrical animations using mental  state terms. Other face-processing and animation descriptions failed to show the  association. Autistic adolescents were impaired at both gaze processing and ToM  descriptions, using these tests. Mentalizing and gaze perception accuracy are  associated in typically developing children and adolescents. The findings are  congruent with the possibility that common neural circuitry underlies, at least  in part, processing implicated in these tasks. They are also congruent with the  possibility that autism may lie at one end of a developmental continuum with  respect to these skills, and to the factor(s) underpinning them.

Pellicano E(1), Maybery M, Durkin K, Maley A.	Author information: (1)University of Oxford, UK. liz.pellicano@psych.ox.ac.uk	This study examined the validity of "weak" central coherence (CC) in the context  of multiple cognitive capabilities/deficits in autism. Children with an autism  spectrum disorder (ASD) and matched typically developing children were  administered tasks tapping visuospatial coherence, false-belief understanding  and aspects of executive control. Significant group differences were found in  all three cognitive domains. Evidence of local processing on coherence tasks was  widespread in the ASD group, but difficulties in attributing false beliefs and  in components of executive functioning were present in fewer of the children  with ASD. This cognitive profile was generally similar for younger and older  children with ASD. Furthermore, weak CC was unrelated to false-belief  understanding, but aspects of coherence (related to integration) were associated  with aspects of executive control. Few associations were found between cognitive  variables and indices of autistic symptomatology. Implications for CC theory are  discussed.

Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, 51 East River Road, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.	Foster care is a protective intervention designed to provide out of home  placement to children living in at-risk home environments. This study employs  prospective longitudinal data (N = 189) to investigate the effects of foster  care on the development of child behavior and psychological functioning taking  into account baseline adaptation prior to placement and socioeconomic status at  the time of placement. Comparisons were made among three groups: children who  experienced foster care, those who were maltreated but remained in the home, and  children who had not experienced foster care or maltreatment despite their  similarly at-risk demographic characteristics. In the current sample, children  placed in out of home care exhibited significant behavior problems in comparison  to children who received adequate care, and using the same pre- and  postplacement measure of adaptation, foster care children showed elevated levels  of behavior problems following release from care. Similarly, children placed  into unfamiliar foster care showed higher levels of internalizing problems  compared with children reared by maltreating caregivers, children in familiar  care, and children who received adequate caregiving. Findings suggest that  outcomes related to foster care may vary with type of care and beyond the  effects associated with maltreatment history, baseline adaptation, and  socioeconomic status.

Developmental trajectories of externalizing and internalizing behaviors: factors  underlying resilience in physically abused children.	Lansford JE(1), Malone PS, Stevens KI, Dodge KA, Bates JE, Pettit GS.	Author information: (1)Center for Child and Family Policy, Duke University, Box 90545, Durham, NC  27708-0545, USA. lansford@duke.edu	Using a multisite community sample of 585 children, this study examined how  protective and vulnerability factors alter trajectories of teacher-reported  externalizing and internalizing behavior from kindergarten through Grade 8 for  children who were and were not physically abused during the first 5 years of  life. Early lifetime history of physical abuse (11.8% of sample) was determined  through interviews with mothers during the prekindergarten period; mothers and  children provided data on vulnerability and protective factors. Regardless of  whether the child was abused, being African American; being male; having low  early social competence, low early socioeconomic status (SES), and low  adolescent SES; and experiencing adolescent harsh discipline, low monitoring,  and low parental knowledge were related to higher levels of externalizing  problems over time. Having low early social competence, low early SES, low  adolescent SES, and low proactive parenting were related to higher levels of  internalizing problems over time. Furthermore, resilience effects, defined as  significant interaction effects, were found for unilateral parental decision  making (lower levels are protective of externalizing outcomes for abused  children), early stress (lower levels are protective of internalizing outcomes  for abused children), adolescent stress (lower levels are protective of  internalizing outcomes for abused children), and hostile attributions (higher  levels are protective of internalizing outcomes for abused children). The  findings provide a great deal of support for an additive or main effect  perspective on vulnerability and protective factors and some support for an  interactive perspective. It appears that some protective and vulnerability  factors do not have stronger effects for physically abused children, but instead  are equally beneficial or harmful to children regardless of their abuse status.

Author information: (1)George Washington University, Ross 550, 2300 Eye Street NW, Washington, DC  20037, USA. psyslw@gwumc.edu	The aim of the research was to test hypotheses concerning the associations  between maternal depressive symptoms and child sleep using longitudinal data to  examine possible predictive pathways. Data from the National Institute of Child  Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care with 1222 children  studied from 1 to 36 months of age were analyzed to examine: effects on  trajectories over time, and phase-specific effects over three defined age  periods (6 to 15, 15 to 24, and 24 to 36 months). Child sleep was found to  influence maternal depressive symptoms only for the 15- to 24-month age period,  where, contrary to expectation, longer duration of child awakenings predicted  decreased maternal depressive symptoms. Maternal depressive symptoms were found  to predict an increased frequency of child awakenings across the 15- to 24-month  age period only. In contrast, maternal depressive symptoms were found to  significantly predict increased duration of child awakenings both for the 3-year  trajectory and across the 15- to 24- and 24- to 36-month age periods. Additional  research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which maternal depressive  symptoms predict increased duration of child awakenings.

Author information: (1)Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program, National Institute of Mental Health,  Bethesda, MD 20892-2670, USA. blairj@intra.nimh.nih.gov	Four models of psychopathy (frontal lobe dysfunction, response set modulation,  fear dysfunction, and violence inhibition mechanism hypotheses) are reviewed  from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience. Each model is considered both  with respect to the psychopathy data and, more importantly, for the present  purposes, with respect to the broader cognitive neuroscience fields to which the  model refers (e.g., models of attention with respect to the response set  modulation account and models of emotion with respect to the fear dysfunction  and violence inhibition mechanism models). The paper concludes with an  articulation of the more recent integrated emotion systems model, an account  inspired both by recent findings in affective cognitive neuroscience as well as  in the study of psychopathy. Some directions for future work are considered.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579405050418 PMID: 16262996 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Attention-deficit disorder (attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder without  hyperactivity): a neurobiologically and behaviorally distinct disorder from  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (with hyperactivity).	Diamond A(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.  adele.diamond@ubc.ca	Most studies of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have focused on  the combined type and emphasized a core problem in response inhibition. It is  proposed here that the core problem in the truly inattentive type of ADHD (not  simply the subthreshold combined type) is in working memory. It is further  proposed that laboratory measures, such as complex-span and dual-task dichotic  listening tasks, can detect this. Children with the truly inattentive type of  ADHD, rather than being distractible, may instead be easily bored, their problem  being more in motivation (underarousal) than in inhibitory control. Much  converging evidence points to a primary disturbance in the striatum (a  frontal-striatal loop) in the combined type of ADHD. It is proposed here that  the primary disturbance in truly inattentive-type ADHD (ADD) is in the cortex (a  frontal-parietal loop). Finally, it is posited that these are not two different  types of ADHD, but two different disorders with different cognitive and  behavioral profiles, different patterns of comorbidities, different responses to  medication, and different underlying neurobiologies.

Three problem behavior dimensions were assessed among  tenth graders, that is, substance use, delinquency, and low school engagement.  Academic achievement was assessed in terms of grades across four major subjects.  Variable-based analyses indicated unique links with grades for self-reported  delinquency and school disengagement in high- and low-income samples, but for  substance use only among the former. Person-based analyses showed that in both  schools, grades were clearly compromised among youth with disturbances in all  three problem domains. In addition, in the suburban school only, grades were low  in the cluster characterized chiefly by high substance use. Results are  discussed in terms of stereotypes regarding risks (or lack thereof) stemming  from families' socioeconomic status; implications for theory and interventions  are also considered.

Results from a genetically informative cross-lagged study.	Burt SA(1), McGue M, Krueger RF, Iacono WG.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Michigan State University, Psychology Building,  East Lansing, MI 48824, USA. burts@msu.edu	The present study attempted to determine the direction and etiology of the  robust relationship between childhood externalizing (EXT) symptoms and  parent-child conflict using a genetically informative longitudinal model and  data from the ongoing Minnesota Twin Family Study. Participants consisted of  1,506 same-sex twins assessed at ages 11 and 14, and their parents. The  relationship between EXT and parent-child conflict from ages 11 to 14 was  examined within a biometrical cross-lagged design. The results revealed three  primary findings: first, the stability of conflict and externalizing over time  is largely, although not solely, a result of genetic factors. Second, there  appears to be a bidirectional relationship between conflict and EXT over time,  such that both conflict and EXT at 11 independently predict the other 3 years  later. Finally, the results are consistent with the notion that parent-child  conflict partially results from parental responses to their child's heritable  externalizing behavior, while simultaneously contributing to child externalizing  via environmental mechanisms. These results suggest a "downward spiral" of  interplay between parent-child conflict and EXT, and offer confirmation of a  (partially) environmentally mediated effect of parenting on child behavior.

Author information: (1)School of Human Ecology, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803,  USA. rlaird@agcenter.lsu.edu	A longitudinal prospective design was used to test the generalizability of low  levels of social preference and high levels of antisocial peer involvement as  risk factors for delinquent behavior problems to African American (AA) and  European American (EA) boys and girls (N = 384). Social preference scores were  computed from peer reports in middle childhood (ages 6-9). Parents and  adolescents reported antisocial peer involvement in early adolescence (ages  13-16) and adolescents reported on their own delinquent behavior in late  adolescence (ages 17 and 18). Analyses tested for differences across four groups  (AA boys, EA boys, AA girls, EA girls) in construct measurement, mean levels,  and associations among variables. Few measurement differences were found.  Mean-level differences were found for social preference and delinquent behavior.  AA boys were least accepted by peers and reported the highest level of  delinquent behavior. EA girls were most accepted by peers and reported the  lowest level of delinquent behavior. Associations among peer experiences and  delinquent behavior were equivalent across groups, with lower levels of social  preference and higher levels of antisocial peer involvement associated with more  delinquent behavior. Person-centered analyses showed the risk associated with  low social preference and high antisocial peer involvement to be similar across  groups, providing further evidence of the generalizability of the peer  relationship experiences as risk factors for subsequent delinquent behavior  problems.

Pears KC(1), Fisher PA.	Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center, 160 East 4th Avenue, Eugene, OR 97401-2426,  USA. katherinep@oslc.org	Children in foster care are at heightened risk for poor psychosocial outcomes.  This study examined differences in two areas that may be associated with many of  these outcomes, emotion understanding and theory of mind, using a sample of 3-  to 5-year-old maltreated foster children (n = 60) and a comparison group of  same-aged, low-income, nonmaltreated children living with their biological  families (n = 31). Being in foster care was significantly associated with worse  emotion understanding and theory of mind capabilities, even when accounting for  age, intelligence, and executive function. There were no significant  associations between length of time in foster care, number of transitions, and  emotion understanding and theory of mind. Results help to expand knowledge about  the cognitive and affective deficits of children in foster care and suggest that  interventions targeted at these deficits include an emphasis on emotion  understanding and theory of mind.

Taking hold of some kind of life: how developmental tasks relate to trajectories  of well-being during the transition to adulthood.	Schulenberg JE(1), Bryant AL, O'Malley PM.	Author information: (1)Survey Research Center, Institute for Social Research, University of  Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48106-1248, USA.	The purpose of this study was to examine how successes and difficulties with  various developmental tasks of early adulthood relate to the course of  well-being. Three waves of national panel data spanning ages 18-26 were drawn  from the Monitoring the Future study (N = 3518). Based on self-reports,  respondents were assigned scores (succeeding, maintaining, or stalling) to  reflect progress in seven domains of developmental tasks: education, work,  financial autonomy, romantic involvement, peer involvement, substance abuse  avoidance, and citizenship. We identified trajectory groups of well-being (based  on self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social support) that reflect diverging  trajectories during the transition: steady-high versus high-decreasing, and  low-increasing versus steady-low. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to  predict membership in the diverging well-being trajectory groups as a function  of developmental task domain scores. Maintaining or gaining a salutary  trajectory of well-being across the transition was found to be a function of  more success and less stalling across the developmental tasks, specifically in  the work, romantic involvement, and citizenship domains. Compensatory effects  (e.g., succeeding in education compensated for not succeeding in work) and  threshold effects (e.g., succeeding in both achievement and affiliation domains  was necessary for a salutary trajectory) were also found.

Author information: (1)Life Course Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.  morti002@atlas.socsci.umn.edu	From a developmental perspective, work has been considered as both a deleterious  and salutary experience. According to one prominent view, part-time work places  adolescents at risk because it limits participation in more developmentally  beneficial activities and confronts them with stressors for which they are not  yet ready. If this were the case, teenage part-time work would be "stress  sensitizing," lowering thresholds of reactivity to subsequent stressors and  increasing the risk of poor young-adult mental health. As a result, early work  experience could interfere with adequate preparation for adulthood. A more  optimistic perspective, shared by some social scientists and most parents, is  that employment for the young person signifies progress in moving toward  adulthood and promotes adaptation to the work environment. Challenges at work  are considered to be "steeling," fostering coping resources that alleviate the  detrimental effects of subsequent stressors, especially those encountered in the  workplace. These processes would promote resilience and psychological well-being  in early adulthood. This research examines these alternatives, using data from  the Youth Development Study (1988--2000) covering the period from adolescence  (age 14-15) to early adulthood (age 26-27). The analysis indicates that the  character of their teenage work experience is a source of resilience as young  adults make the transition from school to work.

Genetic and environmental influences on antisocial behavior and alcohol  dependence from adolescence to early adulthood.	Malone SM(1), Taylor J, Marmorstein NR, McGue M, Iacono WG.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455,  USA. smalone@tfs.psych.umn.edu	Genetic and environmental influences on symptoms of adult antisocial behavior  (AAB) and alcohol dependence at ages 17, 20, and 24 were examined  cross-sectionally and longitudinally in 188 monozygotic and 101 dizygotic male  twin pairs. A moderate genetic influence on both AAB and alcohol dependence was  found at each age, with a substantial proportion of this influence common to the  two disorders, suggesting they share susceptibility genes. Biometrical models  showed that continuity effects accounted for most of the stable variance in  symptoms of both AAB and alcohol dependence, indicating that genetic and  environmental effects associated with each of these disorders were similar at  each age. Significant cross-lag effects (effects of alcohol dependence  contributing to variance in AAB and vice versa) were observed at ages 20 and 24  for both disorders. The largest and theoretically most interesting of these  effects indicated that one sixth of the genetic influence on AAB at age 20 was  due to genetic effects associated with alcohol dependence at age 17. Thus,  alcohol dependence symptoms at age 17 in particular had an effect on antisocial  behavior symptoms at age 20, suggesting that alcohol involvement in adolescence  may ensnare otherwise desisting youth in persistent antisocial behavior.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.  psyefw@emory.edu	Normal adolescent development is often accompanied by transient emotional and  behavioral problems. For most individuals with postpubertal-onset adjustment  problems, there is a resolution by early adulthood and relative stability  through the adult life span. But for a minority, adjustment problems escalate  during adolescence and portend the development of serious mental illness in  adulthood. In this article, we explore adolescent behavioral changes and  neurodevelopmental processes that might contribute to stress sensitivity and  vulnerability for the emergence of the mental disorders. Of particular interest  is the role that hormonal changes might play in the expression of genetic  vulnerabilities for psychopathology. Drawing on recent findings from clinical  research and behavioral neuroscience, we describe the ways in which postpubertal  hormones might alter brain function and, thereby, behavior. It is concluded that  there are both activational and organization effects of hormones on the  adolescent brain, and these contribute to developmental discontinuities in  behavioral adjustment. Implications for adult psychopathology and preventive  intervention are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579404040027 PMID: 15704816 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Davies PT(1), Sturge-Apple ML, Cummings EM.	Author information: (1)Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology, University of  Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA. davies@psych.rochester.edu	We examined the nature and directionality of associations between interparental  discord and parenting practices in a sample of 227 mothers and fathers of  kindergarten children over two measurement waves spaced 1 year apart.  Cross-lagged models indicated that associations between interparental discord  and maternal and paternal parenting practices (i.e., acceptance, discipline)  were generally negligible with one exception: interparental discord at Time 1  predicted decreases in maternal acceptance from Time 1 to Time 2. However,  consistent with the family systems conceptualization of the family as an open  system, prospective associations among interparental and parent-child subsystems  varied significantly as a function of parental depressive symptoms,  interparental relationship insecurity, and child-rearing disagreements. The  moderating role of adult characteristics commonly varied across the type of  adult vulnerability (e.g., depressive symptoms, interparental relationship  insecurity, child-rearing disagreements), dimension of parenting practices  (e.g., maternal and paternal acceptance and inconsistent discipline), and the  directionality of the paths between interparental and parent-child subsystems.

Rogosch FA(1), Cicchetti D, Toth SL.	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, 187 Edinburgh St.,  Rochester, NY 14608, USA.	Expressed emotion was examined in families of toddlers (N = 101) whose mothers  had experienced major depressive disorder occurring since the child's birth, and  contrasted with expressed emotion in demographically comparable families (N =  54) with no history of parental mental disorder to elucidate family systems  processes as contributors to child functioning. Both mothers and fathers  provided Five-Minute Speech Samples on their child, their spouse, and  themselves, and completed measures of marital adjustment, trait affect,  relationship quality with their own parents in childhood, and child behavior  problems. Maternal-expressed emotion criticism regarding child, self, and spouse  was higher in the families with depressed mothers; paternal criticism regarding  self and spouse also was higher in the depressed families. Mothers and fathers  in the depressed group also differed on relational/ affective features,  exhibiting lower marital satisfaction, higher trait negative affect, and more  negative childhood relationship representations, relative to the nondepressed  group, and mothers reported more child behavior problems. Mediational models  were evaluated separately for the different targets of maternal and paternal  criticism and child behavior problems, and findings supported both individual  parent and spouse contributions as mediators of the relation between depression  group status and expressed criticism and child behavior problems. The findings  are discussed in terms of the multiple levels of family system influence on  negativity in the emotional environment of toddlers of depressed mothers,  developmental risk, and the need for family-level interventions.

Miklowitz DJ(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Muenzinger Building, University of Colorado,  Boulder, CO 80309-0345, USA. miklow@psych.colorado.edu	Family systems theory has been highly influential in the study of recurrent  psychiatric disorders. This review examines two interrelated domains: research  on expressed emotion (EE) attitudes among relatives (criticism, hostility, or  emotionally overinvolvement) and relapses of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder,  and randomized trials of family intervention in these populations. The  literature is discussed in terms of contemporary systems theory and concepts  from developmental psychopathology research. Several conclusions are drawn: (a)  levels of EE are correlated with caregivers' attributions regarding the  controllability of patients' behaviors; (b) EE attitudes are associated with  bidirectional, mutually influential cycles of interaction between relatives and  patients; and (c) family psychoeducational therapy, when combined with  pharmacotherapy, is associated with lower rates of relapse in schizophrenia and  bipolar illness. Underlying disturbances in family systems may emerge in  response to illness symptoms in a family member, but also have recursive effects  on the developmental course of the illness once manifest. The nature and  stability of these recursive effects will depend on dynamic processes in the  patient, the relative, and their relationship. Future research should elucidate  mediating and moderating variables in the pathways from EE to patients'  outcomes, and the conditions under which family treatments bring about favorable  outcomes of psychiatric disorder.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seatle 98195, USA.  aleary@u.washington.edu	This article examines the relationship between coparenting and family-level  processes during preschool and peer relationship outcomes in middle childhood,  and the hypothesis that children's ability to regulate emotion (as indexed by  basal vagal tone and the ability to suppress vagal tone) may moderate this  relationship. We predicted that high vagal tone and a greater ability to  suppress vagal tone would buffer children from the effects of negative  coparenting and family processes. Results indicated that hostile-withdrawn  coparenting predicted higher levels of conflicted play and lower levels of  positive peer conversation. Vagal suppression also moderated the relationship  between hostile-withdrawn coparenting and peer conflict. For children who were  unable to suppress vagal tone, hostile-withdrawn coparenting was associated with  higher levels of peer conflict, while for children who were able to suppress  vagal tone there was no relationship hostile-withdrawn coparenting and peer  conflict. The relationship between hostile-withdrawn coparenting and positive  peer conversation was also moderated by children's ability to suppress vagal  tone. For children who were unable to suppress vagal tone, there was no  relationship between hostile-withdrawn coparenting and positive peer  conversation, while for those who were able to suppress vagal tone,  hostile-withdrawn coparenting was associated with less positive peer  conversation. Cohesive family-level processes also predicted positive  conversation in play at age 9 after controlling for positive conversation at age  5; however, this relationship was not moderated by vagal suppression. Basal  vagal tone also did not function as a moderator of relations between  hostile-withdrawn coparenting and peer play. Results are discussed in terms of  the effects of negative coparenting on children with different patterns of  modulating physiological arousal.

Observations of early triadic family interactions: boundary disturbances in the  family predict symptoms of depression, anxiety, and  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in middle childhood.	Jacobvitz D(1), Hazen N, Curran M, Hitchens K.	Author information: (1)Human Development and Family Sciences, 117 Gearing Hall, University of Texas  at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA. debj@mail.utexas.edu	This article argues for the importance of focusing explicitly on the construct  of boundary disturbances in families to understand the development of  depressive, anxious, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  symptoms in middle childhood. Grounded in family systems theory, this study  examined traditional parent-child antecedents of childhood depression and  anxiety (hostile, controlling, and disengaged interactions) in the context of  the entire family as well as enmeshed patterns, whereby one parent drew in the  child by turning to the child for caregiving or intimacy and excluded the  spouse, and balanced patterns, whereby all family members expressed  vulnerabilities and asserted their needs or desires. Mostly White, middle-class  mothers, fathers, and children were observed at home interacting on a series of  everyday tasks when the children were 24 months old, and mothers and teachers  rated children's symptoms of anxiety, depression, somatic problems, and ADHD at  age 7. Regression analyses revealed that, after controlling for maternal  depression and the effects of other family patterns, enmeshed family patterns  forecast children's depressive symptoms; controlling and disengaged interactions  predicted anxious and depressive symptoms; and hostility forecast ADHD and  somatic complaints. Intriguing gender differences emerged. As predicted, whereas  boys who experienced enmeshed family patterns more often developed symptoms of  ADHD, girls who experienced enmeshed family interactions later showed symptoms  of depression.

Pathways between profiles of family functioning, child security in the  interparental subsystem, and child psychological problems.	Davies PT(1), Cummings EM, Winter MA.	Author information: (1)Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology, University of  Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA. davies@psych.rochester.edu	This study was designed to delineate pathways between systems profiles of family  functioning, children's emotional insecurity in the interparental relationship,  and their psychological adjustment in a sample of 221 children and their  parents. Consistent with family systems theory, cluster analyses conducted with  assessments of marital, coparental, and parent-child functioning indicated that  families fit into one of four profiles: (a) cohesive families, characterized by  warmth, affection, and flexible well-defined boundaries in family relationships;  (b) disengaged families, reflected in high levels of adversity and low levels of  support across family subsystems; (c) enmeshed families, evidenced by high  levels of discord and weak maintenance of relationship boundaries in the family  unit; and (d) adequate families, defined by elevated parental psychological  control within a larger family context of low discord and high warmth. In  comparison to children in cohesive families, children in enmeshed and disengaged  families exhibited greater signs of insecurity in the interparental relationship  concurrently and internalizing and externalizing symptoms both concurrently and  1 year later. Structural equation models revealed that a latent, multimethod  measure of insecurity in the interparental relationship partially mediated  associations between family enmeshment and disengagement and children's  psychological symptoms 1 year later. Results are discussed in relation to how  they inform and refine a family-wide model of the emotional security hypothesis.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579404004651 PMID: 15605624 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Five types of families were identified: Consistently  Supportive (i.e., good parenting, good marriage, 15% of sample), Consistently  Moderate (i.e., moderate marriage, moderate parenting. 43%), Consistently Risky  (i.e., poor parenting, poor marriage, 16%), Good Parenting/Poor Marriage (19%),  and Poor Parenting/Good Marriage (7%). When groups were compared in terms of  contextual antecedents (measured at child age 1 month) and child  cognitive-academic and socioemotional functioning in first grade, results  indicated (a) that contextual risks increased linearly and children's  functioning decreased linearly as one moved across the first three  aforementioned groups; and after controlling for group differences in background  factors (b) that children in the Good-Parenting/Poor-Marriage families  outperformed those in the Poor Parenting/Good Marriage; (c) that there was  evidence of "added value" developmentally when children experienced two sources  of support (i.e., good marriage and good parenting) rather than just one (i.e.,  good marriage or good parenting); but (d) that there was only modest evidence of  protective buffering whereby children experiencing just good parenting (but not  just good marriages) outperformed children experiencing poor parenting and poor  marriages. Results are discussed in terms of the relative influence of marriage  and parenting on child development and the potential benefits of applying  typological approaches to the study of marriage-parenting family subsystems.

Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh, USA. potatoseason@yahoo.com	Using cross-domain latent growth modeling, we examined trajectories of  externalizing and internalizing problems in disadvantaged boys followed from  ages 2 to 6 years (N = 303). On average, externalizing problems gradually  decreased and internalizing problems gradually increased. However, we found  significant variability in individual-level trajectories. Higher levels of  externalizing problems were associated with higher levels of internalizing  problems; rates of change were also positively correlated across domains. In  addition, high levels of externalizing problems predicted rapid increases in  internalizing problems. In follow-up analyses involving child and parenting  factors, the combination of high negative emotionality, low fearfulness, and  high negative maternal control preceded high, nondecreasing externalizing  trajectories. The combination of high negative emotionality, high fearfulness,  and high negative maternal control preceded high, increasing internalizing  trajectories. Taken together, the results indicate both general and specific  processes in the development of early externalizing and internalizing problems.

Author information: (1)School of Education, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel.  bauminn@mail.biu.ac.il	We investigated the expression and understanding of jealousy in 16  high-functioning children with autism and 17 typically developing children  matched for IQ, chronological age, gender, and maternal education. We examined  the expression of jealousy via children's behaviors, verbalizations, and affects  demonstrated during two jealousy-provoking triadic scenarios (drawing and  playing) enacted among the child in the experimental group (autism or typical),  that child's main caregiver (mostly mothers), and a familiar peer or sibling.  The two scenarios corresponded with the two types of jealousy described in past  studies: social-comparison jealousy (drawing scenario) and social-relational  jealousy (playing scenario). To tap children's understanding, we asked them to  identify jealousy from a picture, to provide examples of times they felt  jealous, and to offer suggestions for coping with jealousy. The main results  revealed that children with autism expressed jealousy in situations similar to  their typical age mates but manifested it in different behaviors. Moreover,  children with autism revealed a less coherent understanding of the feeling. We  discuss the meaning of the gap between demonstrating and understanding jealousy  in light of the two central theoretical views conceptualizing the core emotional  deficit in children with autism.

The impact of high neuroticism in parents on children's psychosocial functioning  in a population at high risk for major affective disorder: a  family-environmental pathway of intergenerational risk.	Ellenbogen MA(1), Hodgins S.	Author information: (1)Départment de Psychologie, Université de Montréal, Québec, Canada.  mark.ellenbogen@umontreal.ca	Behavioral genetic studies indicate that nongenetic factors play a role in the  development of bipolar and major depressive disorders. The trait of neuroticism  is common among individuals with major affective disorders. We hypothesized that  high neuroticism among parents affects the family environment and parenting  practices and thereby increases the risk of psychosocial problems among  offspring. This hypothesis is tested in a sample of participants at high and low  risk for major affective disorders, which contained parents with bipolar  disorder (55), major depression (21), or no mental disorder (148) and their 146  children between 4 and 14 years of age. Parents with high neuroticism scores  were characterized by low psychosocial functioning, poor parenting, more  dependent stressful life events, and the use of more emotion-focused and less  task-oriented coping skills. High neuroticism in parents was associated with  internalizing and externalizing problems among the children, as assessed by  parent and teacher ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist and clinician  ratings. The results suggest that high neuroticism in parents with major  affective disorders is associated with inadequate parenting practices and the  creation of a stressful family environment, which are subsequently related to  psychosocial problems among the offspring.

Lopez NL(1), Vazquez DM, Olson SL.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109, USA.  nestorl@umich.edu	An integrative model of the neurophysiology of aggression and social withdrawal  is proposed. A detailed overview of the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (LHPA) axis is presented first, because we consider it to be a critical system  that interacts with a variety of physiological processes to modulate  affect-related behaviors. This detailed analysis of the LHPA axis is then used  to clarify the research literature that links aggression and social withdrawal  to LHPA functioning. We then review the role of amygdala and prefrontal cortex  functioning in modulating aggression and social withdrawal. Particular attention  is paid to how the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex interact with the LHPA  system and the environment to produce specific behavioral tendencies throughout  development. A brief overview of the implied methodological and theoretical  model is provided. We explain how a detailed understanding of specific  physiological processes is essential in order to develop appropriate research  protocols. In addition, we suggest that future research should focus on the  mapping of distinct integrative biosocial profiles that are related to specific  behaviors during different developmental stages.

Author information: (1)Department of Medical Psychology, University of Giessen, Germany.  ursula.pauli-pott@psycho.med.uni-giessen.de	Few studies have examined the associations between environmental conditions and  developing infant emotionality or the differential susceptibility to those  conditions. The present longitudinal study aims to make a contribution to close  that gap. We analyzed whether positive emotionality, negative  emotionality/irritability, and withdrawal/fear at the end of the first year of  life are predictable from preceding caregiver's depression/anxiety, social  support, and sensitivity in the interaction with the infant while controlling  for antecedent states of emotionality. Furthermore, the question of whether  associations between maternal characteristics and subsequent fear are stronger  in the subgroup of infants high in irritability as opposed to those who are low  in irritability was investigated. Subjects were 101 healthy firstborn infants  and their primary caregivers. Assessments were conducted at infant ages of 4, 8,  and 12 months. Depression, anxiety, and the social support of the caregiver were  assessed by questionnaire. Sensitivity in the caregiver-infant interaction was  assessed by behavior observations within the scope of home visits. Temperament  characteristics were observed in standardized laboratory episodes. Whereas  negative emotionality and withdrawal/fear were significantly predictable from  the maternal characteristics, no predictability could be shown for developing  positive emotionality. There were indications of a stronger association between  the maternal characteristics and developing withdrawal/fear in irritable  infants.	PMID: 15115063 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The effect of postnatal depression on mother-infant interaction, infant response  to the Still-face perturbation, and performance on an Instrumental Learning  task.	Stanley C(1), Murray L, Stein A.	Author information: (1)Sunderland Royal Hospital.	A representative community sample of primiparous depressed women and a  nondepressed control group were assessed while in interaction with their infants  at 2 months postpartum. At 3 months, infants were assessed on the Still-face  perturbation of face to face interaction, and a subsample completed an  Instrumental Learning paradigm. Compared to nondepressed women, depressed  mothers' interactions were both less contingent and less affectively attuned to  infant behavior. Postnatal depression did not adversely affect the infant's  performance in either the Still-face perturbation or the Instrumental Learning  assessment. Maternal responsiveness in interactions at 2 months predicted the  infant's performance in the Instrumental Learning assessment but not in the  Still-face perturbation. The implications of these findings for theories of  infant cognitive and emotional development are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579404044384 PMID: 15115062 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, USA.  mposner@darkwing.uoregon.edu	Human variability in temperament allows a unique natural experiment where  reactivity, self-regulation, and experience combine in complex ways to produce  an individual personality. Personality disorders may result from changes in the  way past memories filter new information in situations of emotional involvement  with others. According to this view, disorders are specific to their initiating  circumstances rather than a general difficulty that might extend to classes of  information processing remote from triggers for the disorder. A different view  suggests a more general deficit in attentional control mechanisms that might  extend to a wide range of situations far from those related to the core  abnormality. This paper outlines methods for examining these views and presents  data from the study of borderline personality disorder, arguing in favor of high  negative emotionality being combined with a deficit in an executive attentional  control network. Because this attentional network has already been well  described in terms of anatomy, the cognitive operations involved, development,  chemical modulators, and effects of lesions and candidate genes, these findings  may have implications for understanding the disorder and its treatment. We  consider these implications in terms of a general approach to the study of  personality development and its disorders.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579403000506 PMID: 14984139 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Luciana M(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.  lucia003@tc.umn.edu	The human brain is functionally altered through experience, a phenomenon known  as plasticity. Relevant experiences may be negative, as in brain injury. Adult  brain injury results in permanent impairment. However, it has been assumed that  early injury leads to substantial functional recovery. Animal studies suggest  several predictions regarding whether this principle generally holds true. These  studies indicate that the timing of brain injury, relative to the expected  course of neurodevelopment, impacts the extent of recovery. Injuries occurring  during the period of cell migration are particularly detrimental. However,  outcome must be assessed longitudinally because apparent recovery in childhood  may reverse as the brain matures. Moreover, recovery of one function may come at  the expense of others. Whether these findings characterize outcome following  preterm birth is the focus of this review. Preterm birth is associated with high  rates of neurodevelopmental disability, primarily due to hypoxic-ischemic  events. Periventricular brain structures and white matter tracts are  particularly vulnerable to damage. Through school age, preterm children exhibit  diminished levels of global intellectual function, attention, memory, and  reasoning skills relative to full-term peers. It is questionable whether these  deficits persist. Because few studies have followed recent cohorts into young  adulthood, it is argued that outcome cannot be reliably described based on the  available literature. Moreover, important contributors to later development have  been neglected, including both genetic and experiential factors. With improved  assessment, it may be possible to develop interventions based on the individual  child's constellation of genetic, biological, and sociodemographic risks.

Author information: (1)Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14850, USA. jjh15@cornell.edu	Adoption provides a unique opportunity for the study of child development.  Because adopted children are raised in families in which they have no genetic  relationship with their parents, and possibly none with their siblings, they  provide a rare opportunity to study the relative importance of genetic, shared  environmental, and nonshared environmental influences on the development of  child characteristics and behaviors. Because children are adopted from a variety  of circumstances and at a wide range of ages, studies of adopted children and  their families provide researchers the opportunity to examine the short- and  long-term influences of a wide range of environments on children's development.  Because children are adopted into homes with a range of characteristics (e.g.,  multiracial homes), adoption provides the opportunity to study the range of  influences of these homes on child development. Adoption research that focuses  on each of these areas is reviewed in this article. We present conclusions about  the value of adoption in psychological research and some reasons why many  psychologists ignore the opportunities presented by studying adoptive families,  as well as potential useful directions for future research with adopted children  and their families.

Author information: (1)Psychology Department, St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova  Scotia, Canada. kmaclean@stfx.ca	During the past 10 years researchers studying children adopted from Romanian  orphanages have had the opportunity to revisit developmental questions regarding  the impact of early deprivation on child development. In the present paper the  effects of deprivation are examined by reviewing both the early and more recent  literature on studies of children who spent the first few years of life in  institutions. Special attention is given to the Canadian study of Romanian  adoptees in which the author has been involved. Findings across time and studies  are consistent in showing the negative impact of institutionalization on all  aspects of children's development (intellectual, physical, behavioral, and  social emotional). Results of studies show, however, that institutionalization,  although a risk factor for less optimal development, does not doom a child to  psychopathology. However, the impact of institutionalization is greater when  coupled with risk factors in the postinstitutional environment. Methodological  and conceptual difficulties in research with institutionalized samples of  children are discussed and future directions for research are considered.

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities,  Minneapolis 55455, USA. crick001@umn.edu	In recent years, the role of gender in the development of psychopathology has  increasingly attracted the attention of researchers, theoreticians, and other  professionals interested in the well-being of children and adolescents. This  interest has taken diverse forms, ranging from the examination of sex  differences in the prevalence of adjustment difficulties to the exploration of  unique etiologies and trajectories in the development of psychopathology for  boys versus girls. In this paper we (a) critically examine the current status of  available theories, research, and methods related to the study of gender and  psychopathology and provide recommendations for future work; (b) identify  promising new trends that appear to have utility for enhancing our understanding  of the role of gender in the development of adjustment difficulties; and (c)  generate conclusions regarding gender and psychopathology by integrating  information from past and present work with new ideas about fruitful directions  for future inquiry.

Thompson RA(1), Raikes HA.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Nebraska, Lincoln 68588-0308, USA.  rthompsonl@unl.edu	Attachment theory and research have offered fundamental insights into early  sociopersonality development for the past quarter-century. As its scope expands  throughout the life course with applications to developmental psychopathology,  however, attachment work faces important conceptual and methodological  challenges. These include (a) expanding Bowlby's theoretical formulations to  address developmental changes in the nature of attachment organization beyond  infancy, the converging influence of multiple attachment relationships, and the  nature and development of internal working models: (b) systematically validating  assessments of attachment security for older ages in the context of enhanced  theoretical understanding of how attachment itself changes with age; (c) new  methodological approaches to understanding the relations between attachment and  later behavior in light of empirical evidence of stability and change in  attachment security and the need for explicit theoretical predictions of the  sequelae of attachment security; and (d) more complex conceptualizations of the  associations among attachment, contextual risk, and later behavior. These are  similar to the challenges facing the original pioneers of attachment theory and  research, suggesting that familiar problems must now be reconsidered against the  landscape of new applications of attachment work and the insights of  contemporary developmental science.

Sameroff AJ(1), Mackenzie MJ.	Author information: (1)Center for Human Growth and Development, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor  48109-0406, USA. sameroff@umich.edu	Transactional models have informed research design and interpretation in studies  relevant to developmental psychopathology. Bidirectional effects between  individuals and social contexts have been found in many behavioral and cognitive  domains. This review will highlight representative studies where the  transactional model has been explicitly or implicitly tested. These studies  include experimental, quasiexperimental, and naturalistic designs. Extensions of  the transactional model have been made to interventions designed to target  different aspects of a bidirectional system in efforts to improve developmental  outcomes. Problems remain in the need to theoretically specify structural models  and to combine analyses of transactions in the parent-child relationship with  transactions in the broader social contexts. Longitudinal studies with  sufficient time points to assess reciprocal processes continue to be important.  Such longitudinal investigations will permit identifying developmental periods  where the child or the context may be most influential or most open to change.

Research strategies in developmental psychopathology: dimensional identity and  the person-oriented approach.	von Eye A(1), Bergman LR.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824-1117,  USA.	This article deals with alternative research strategies for developmental  psychopathology. It argues that most applications of statistical methods in  empirical research are variable centered, not person oriented. As a result,  conclusions are often drawn that fail to do justice to the diverse nature of  populations. It is recommended that we take seriously the importance of the  implications of data aggregation. The difficulties of making inferences from a  more aggregated level of analysis to a less aggregated level are explained and  exemplified. We explain that a set of variables displays dimensional identity if  the variable relationships remain unchanged across the levels or categories of  other variables. Data examples of intelligence divergence and of Child Behavior  Checklist subpopulation differences show that lack of dimensional identity can  lead to incorrect conclusions. Schmitz' theorems on aggregation and the validity  of results at the aggregate level for individuals are illustrated using data  from a study on the development of alcoholism and discussed from a  person-oriented perspective. Statistical methods suitable for person-oriented  data analysis are reviewed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579403000294 PMID: 14582932 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195-1525, USA.  tbeaucha@u.washington.edu	Developmental psychopathologists have criticized categorical classification  systems for their inability to account for within-group heterogeneity in  biological, etiological. developmental, and cultural influences on behavior.  Dichotomizing continuous scores of symptom severity is also inadvisable  statistically. Perhaps because of a resulting wariness of categorizing, few  explorations into the ontological status of traits or disorders as dimensional  versus discrete have been conducted. It is argued here that the limitations of  categorizing have little to do with the ontological status of traits and that  developmental psychopathologists should be concerned with identifying discrete  behavioral syndromes. Common taxometric methods for resolving discrete traits  are described, and questions of concern to developmental psychopathologists are  outlined that can be addressed through taxometrics studies. These include (a)  identifying children who are at risk for future psychopathology, (b) identifying  discrete subtypes within current diagnostic classes, (c) locating sensitive  periods in the development of discrete pathological traits, (d) discovering  moderators of treatment outcome, and (e) elucidating mechanisms of equifinality  and multifinality. Although most behavioral traits probably are distributed  continuously, identifying those that are discrete will advance the science of  developmental psychopathology. Disorders for which taxometric analyses might be  applied include anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism  spectrum disorders, conduct problems, depression, and schizophrenia.

Granger DA(1), Shirtcliff EA, Zahn-Waxler C, Usher B, Klimes-Dougan B, Hastings  P.	Author information: (1)Department of Biobehavioral Health, Pennsylvania State University, University  Park 16802, USA. dag11@psu.edu	Individual differences in salivary testosterone were examined in 213 adolescents  (106 boys, 107 girls; mean age = 13.66 years) in relation to externalizing and  internalizing psychopathology. Self- and parent-report measures of behavior  problems and psychiatric symptoms were obtained. Latent anxiety-depression,  disruptive behavior, and attention problem constructs were developed using  multitrait, multimethod procedures. Saliva samples were collected in the  morning, midday, and late afternoon on multiple days and were later assayed for  testosterone. Latent constructs were derived for testosterone level and diurnal  variation across the six sampling occasions. Structural equations modeled  relationships between problem behavior and intra- and interindividual  differences in testosterone separately by gender. For boys, lower levels of  testosterone and testosterone levels that decreased more slowly across the day  were related to higher levels of anxiety-depression and attention problems.  These associations were not moderated by pubertal development. For girls, steep  declines in testosterone production across the day related to higher levels of  disruptive behavior problems, but this association was only evident after  including pubertal development as a moderator in the model. These findings raise  novel questions regarding the nature and magnitude of links between testosterone  and problem behavior in youth.	PMID: 12931836 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Fine SE(1), Izard CE, Mostow AJ, Trentacosta CJ, Ackerman BP.	Author information: (1)University of Delaware, Newark 19716, USA.	In this longitudinal study, we examined the relations between emotion knowledge  in first grade, teacher reports of internalizing and externalizing behaviors  from first grade, and children's self-reported internalizing behaviors in fifth  grade. At Time 1, we assessed emotion knowledge, expressive vocabulary,  caregiver-reported earned income, and teacher-rated internalizing and  externalizing behaviors in 7-year-old children from economically disadvantaged  families (N = 154). At Time 2, when the children were age 11, we collected  children's self-reports of negative emotions, depression, anxiety, and  loneliness. First grade teacher-reported externalizing behaviors, but not first  grade internalizing behaviors, were positively related to children's  self-reports of internalizing behaviors in fifth grade. First grade emotion  knowledge accounted for a significant amount of variance in children's  self-reports of internalizing symptoms 4 years later, after controlling for per  capita earned income, expressive vocabulary, and teacher-reported internalizing  and externalizing behaviors in first grade.

Author information: (1)Child and Family Center, Department of Psychology, University of Oregon,  Eugene 97401-3408, USA. tomd@darkwing.uoregon.edu	This paper reviews the model-building approach to developmental psychopathology  as it applies to understanding the influence of peers on adolescent problem  behavior. Considerable longitudinal evidence suggests that deviant peer  involvement is prognostic of escalations in various forms of problem behavior,  including substance use, delinquent behavior, and violence. Most convincing,  however, are data from randomized intervention trials that show alarming  iatrogenic effects for aggregating high-risk peers. This paper shows that  intervention research can also clarify the role of parents in reducing deviant  peer involvement. Results from a 4-year prevention trial are reported for a  community sample of multiethnic middle school youth. Random assignment to  family-centered services in a school Family Resource center produced reduced  growth in deviant peer involvement. The extensiveness of the parenting  intervention was correlated with reduced growth in deviant peer involvement,  especially among high-risk youth. Findings are discussed with respect to  developmental theory and the design of future intervention trials that clarify  the role of adults in structuring the emerging adolescents' world of peers.

Johnson MH(1), Halit H, Grice SJ, Karmiloff-Smith A.	Author information: (1)Centre for Brain & Cognitive Development, School of Psychology, Birkbeck  College, University of London, UK.	To date, research involving functional neuroimaging of typical and atypical  development has depended on several assumptions about the postnatal maturation  of the brain. We consider evidence from multiple levels of analysis that brings  into question these underlying assumptions and advance an alternative view. This  alternative view, based on an "interactive specialization" approach to postnatal  brain development, indicates that there is a need to: obtain data from early in  development; focus more on differences in interregional interactions rather than  searching for localized, discrete lesions; examine the temporal dynamics of  neural processing; and move away from deficits to image tasks in which atypical  participants perform as well as typically developing participants.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of Massachusetts Medical Center,  Worcester 01655, USA. Russell.Barkley@banyan.ummed.edu	A significant discrepancy between intelligence and daily adaptive functioning,  or adaptive disability (AD), has been previously found to be a associated with  significant psychological morbidity in preschool children with disruptive  behavior (DB). The utility of AD as a predictor of later developmental risks was  examined in a 3-year longitudinal study of normal (N = 43) and DB preschool  children. The DB children were grouped into those with AD (DB+AD; N = 28) and  those without AD (DB-only; N = 98). All children were followed with annual  evaluations to the end of second grade. Both DB groups demonstrated substantial  and pervasive psychological and educational morbidity at 3-year follow-up. In  comparison to DB-only children, DB+AD children had more symptoms of  attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (CD), more  severe and pervasive behavior problems at home, more parent-rated externalizing  and internalizing, and lower academic competence and more behavioral problems at  school. Parents of DB+AD children also reported greater parenting stress than  did parents in the other groups. A significant contribution of AD to adverse  outcomes in the DB group remained on some measures even after controlling for  initial severity of DB. AD also contributed significantly to CD symptoms at  follow-up after controlling for initial DB severity and initial CD symptoms. The  results corroborate and extend earlier findings of the utility of AD as a risk  indicator above severity of DB alone. They also imply that AD in the context of  normal intellectual development may arise from both the deficient  self-regulation associated with ADHD and from disrupted parenting. with exposure  to kindergarten moderating these adverse effects.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,  27599-3270, USA. ahussong@email.unc.edu	Although they have received little empirical attention, departures from the  parental home play a significant role in demarcating the transition from  adolescence to young adulthood. The current study examined the extent to which  various features of young adults' experiences of leaving home differed for  children of alcoholic (COAs) versus nonalcoholic parents, what adolescent  precursors might account for noted differences and what indicators of young  adult adjustment are related to the leaving home experience. A total of 227  young adults drawn from a high-risk, community sample of COAs and matched  controls were interviewed at ages 18-23 years regarding their prior leaving home  experiences. COAs showed greater difficulties in negotiating this transition,  fewer positive feelings about the transition, and different reasons for leaving  home as compared to participants without an alcoholic parent. Moreover,  adolescent risk behaviors, family conflict, and family disorganization (assessed  prior to this transition) each partly accounted for COAs' risk for difficulty in  the leaving home transition. Although certain aspects of the leaving home  transition were uniquely related to young adult adjustment, future research is  still needed to more comprehensively understand the implications for young adult  development associated with such individual differences in the leaving home  transition.

Thornberry TP(1), Ireland TO, Smith CA.	Author information: (1)School of Criminal Justice, University at Albany, New York 12222, USA.  t.thornberry@albany.edu	A substantial body of literature suggests that childhood maltreatment is related  to negative outcomes during adolescence, including delinquency, drug use,  teenage pregnancy, and school failure. There has been relatively little research  examining the impact that variation in the developmental stage during which the  maltreatment occurs has on these relationships, however. In this paper, we  reassess the impact of maltreatment on a number of adverse outcomes when  developmentally specific measures of maltreatment-maltreatment that occurs only  in childhood, only in adolescence, or in both childhood and adolescence-are  considered. Data are drawn from the Rochester Youth Development Study, a  broad-based longitudinal study of adolescent development. The analysis examines  how maltreatment affects delinquency, drug use, alcohol-related problems,  depressive symptoms, teen pregnancy. school dropout, and internalizing and  externalizing problems during adolescence. We also examine whether the type of  maltreatment experienced at various developmental stages influences the  outcomes. Overall, our results suggest that adolescent and persistent  maltreatment have stronger and more consistent negative consequences during  adolescence than does maltreatment experienced only in childhood.

Wekerle C(1), Wolfe DA, Hawkins DL, Pittman AL, Glickman A, Lovald BE.	Author information: (1)York University. chris_wekerle@camh.net	The present study, utilizing both a child protective services and high school  sample of midadolescents, examined the issue of self-report of maltreatment as  it relates to issues of external validity (i.e., concordance with social worker  ratings). reliability (i.e.. overlap with an alternate child maltreatment  self-report inventory; association of a self-labeling item as "abused" with  their subscale item counterparts), and construct validity (i.e., the association  of maltreatment with posttraumatic stress symptomatology and dating violence).  Relevant theoretical work in attachment, trauma, and relationship violence  points to a mediational model, whereby the relationship between childhood  maltreatment and adolescent dating violence would be expected to be accounted  for by posttraumatic stress symptomatology. In the high school sample, 1329  adolescents and, in the CPS sample, 224 youth on the active caseloads completed  comparable questionnaires in the three domains of interest. For females only,  results supported a mediational model in the prediction of dating violence in  both samples. For males, child maltreatment and trauma symptomatology added  unique contributions to predicting dating violence. with no consistent pattern  emerging across samples. When considering the issue of self-labeling as abused.  CPS females who self-labeled had higher posttraumatic stress symptomatology and  dating violence victimization scores than did their nonlabeling, maltreated  counterparts for emotional maltreatment. These results point to the need for  ongoing work in understanding the process of disclosure and how maltreatment  experiences are consciously conceptualized.	PMID: 11771911 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Child and Adolescent Services, Valley Regional Hospital, Kentville, Canada.  robin.mcgee@ns.sympatico.ca	The study examined the predictive utility of blame attributions for  maltreatment. Integrating theory and research on blame attribution, it was  predicted that self-blame would mediate or moderate internalizing problems,  whereas other-blame would mediate or moderate externalizing problems. Mediator  and moderator models were tested separately. Adolescents (N = 160, ages 11-17  years) were randomly selected from the open caseload of a child protection  agency. Participants made global maltreatment severity ratings for each of  physical abuse, psychological abuse, neglect. sexual abuse, and exposure to  family violence. Participants also completed the Attribution for Maltreatment  Interview (AFMI), a structured clinical interview that assessed self- and  perpetrator blame for each type of maltreatment they experienced. The AFMI  yielded five subscales: self-blaming cognition, self-blaming affect,  self-excusing. perpetrator blame, and perpetrator excusing. Caretaker-reported  (Child Behavior Checklist) and self-reported (Youth Self Report) internalizing  and externalizing were the adjustment criteria. Controlling for maltreatment  severity, the AFMI subscales explained significant variance in self-reported  adjustment. Self-blaming affect was the most potent attribution, particularly  among females. Attributions mediated maltreatment severity for self-reported  adjustment but moderated it for caretaker-reported adjustment. The  sophistication and relevance of blame attributions to adjustment are discussed,  and implications for research and clinical practice are identified.	PMID: 11771910 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Salzinger S(1), Feldman RS, Ng-Mak DS, Mojica E, Stockhammer TF.	Author information: (1)New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York 10032, USA. ss73@columbia.edu	This study proposes a model explaining the association between physical abuse of  children and children's social and affective status as one in which children's  social expectations and behavior, developed within the context of abusive  parenting, mediate current functioning in these two outcome domains. Subjects  included one hundred 9 to 12-year-old physically abused children recruited from  consecutive entries onto the New York State Register for Child Abuse for New  York City and 100 case-matched classmate nonabused comparison children.  Sociometric assessments were carried out in classrooms, interviews were  conducted with the children and their parents, and teachers, parents, and  classmates rated the children's behavior. Path analysis was utilized to test the  conceptually derived models. Children's social expectations regarding peers, and  two social behaviors--aggressive behavior and prosocial behavior--were found to  mediate between abuse and positive and negative social status, as well as  between abuse and positive and negative reciprocity. Social expectations and  withdrawn behavior mediated between abuse and positive social status, but only  where withdrawn behavior was a function of social expectations. Social  expectations were generally found to mediate between abuse and internalizing  problems. Negative social status (peer rejection) added to social expectations  in producing internalizing problems. Identification of these mediating pathways  can serve to guide secondary preventive intervention efforts so that they best  address the problems abused children face in the absence of adequate parental  and peer support as the children enter adolescence.

Can poverty get under your skin? basal cortisol levels and cognitive function in  children from low and high socioeconomic status.	Lupien SJ(1), King S, Meaney MJ, McEwen BS.	Author information: (1)Laboratory of Human Psychoneuroendocrine Research, Douglas Hospital/McGill  University, Lasalle, Montréal, Canada. Lupson@douglas.mcgill.ca	It is well known that individuals from more advantaged social classes enjoy  better mental and physical health than do individuals within lower classes.  Various mechanisms have been evoked to explain the association between  socioeconomic status (SES) and health. One mechanism that has received  particular attention in recent years is stress. It has been shown that  individuals lower in SES report greater exposure to stressful life events and a  greater impact of these events on their life than individuals higher in SES. In  order to measure whether the development of the relationship between SES and  mental health is sustained by exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids, we  measured morning salivary cortisol levels as well as cognitive function (memory,  attention, and language) in 307 children (from 6 to 16 years of age) from low  versus high SES in the Montreal area in Canada. The results revealed that low  SES children from 6 to 10 years old present significantly higher salivary  cortisol levels when compared to children from high SES. This difference  disappears at the time of school transition, and no SES differences are observed  in salivary cortisol levels during high school. However, children from low and  high SES do not differ with regard to memory or to attentional and linguistic  functions. Also, mothers of low SES children reported higher feelings of  depression and more unhealthy behaviors, while mothers of high SES children  reported higher stress related to work or family transitions. Altogether, these  results show that low SES in young children is related to increased cortisol  secretion, although the impact of SES on cortisol secretion is absent after  transition to high school. These data are interpreted within the context of the  equalization process of class patterning. Four social explanatory factors are  suggested to explain the disappearance of SES differences in basal cortisol  levels after school transition, taking into account the influence of family  environment on the child's secretion of stress hormones.

Author information: (1)Department of Biobehavioral Health, The Pennsylvania State University,  University Park 16802, USA. esusman@psu.edu	The study was based on the assumption that stressors in the lives of pregnant  and parenting women are processes that affect prenatal, postpartum, and  concurrent maternal hormones and emotions and that these processes affect child  temperament. The hypotheses were tested in a group of 67 young mothers and their  3-year-old children. Mothers were clustered into groups based on longitudinal  patterns of hormones and emotions at prenatal, postpartum. and 3-year follow-up  assessments. The analyses focused on relating maternal patterns of hormones and  emotions to the child's temperament at age 3 years. Temperament was assessed by  questionnaire and observation of behavior during a challenging situation.  Illustrative findings included the following. Verbal aggression and nonverbal  aggression were significantly higher in children of mothers in the low prenatal  hormone cluster than children of mothers in the high prenatal hormone cluster.  Children of mothers in the postpartum low testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), and  androstenedione (delta4-A) and medium cortisol (Cort) cluster (mainly low  hormone cluster) exhibited significantly more physical aggression than children  of mothers in the medium T and A4-A, high E2 and low Cort cluster. Maternal  patterns of hormones, emotions, and parenting attitudes and practices were  related to multiple aspects of temperament when the children were age 3 years.  The findings support the important role of maternal biological and psychological  processes in the development of child temperament.

Gunnar MR(1), Morison SJ, Chisholm K, Schuder M.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, 55455,  USA. Gunnar@tc.umn.edu	Six and a half years after adoption. 6- to 12-year-old children reared in  Romanian orphanages for more than 8 months in their first years of life (RO. n =  18) had higher cortisol levels over the daytime hours than did early adopted  (EA, < or = 4 months of age, n = 15) and Canadian born (CB, n = 27) children.  The effect was marked, with 22% of the RO children exhibiting cortisol levels  averaged over the day that exceeded the mean plus 2 SD of the EA and CB levels.  Furthermore, the longer beyond 8 months that the RO children remained  institutionalized the higher their cortisol levels. Cortisol levels for EA  children did not differ in any respect from those of CB comparison children.  This latter finding reduces but does not eliminate concerns that the results  could be due to prenatal effects or birth family characteristics associated with  orphanage placement. Neither age at cortisol sampling nor low IQ measured  earlier appeared to explain the findings. Because the conditions in Romanian  orphanages at the time these children were adopted were characterized by  multiple risk factors, including gross privation of basic needs and exposure to  infectious agents, the factor(s) that produced the increase in cortisol  production cannot be determined. Nor could we determine whether these results  reflected effects on the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis directly or  were mediated by differences in parent-child interactions or family stress  occasion by behavioral problems associated with prolonged orphanage care in this  sample.

Author information: (1)Biological Psychiatry Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda,  MD 20892-1272, USA.	Different types of psychosocial stressors have long been recognized as potential  precipitants of both unipolar and bipolar affective episodes and the causative  agents in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). New preclinical data have  revealed some of the neurobiological mechanisms that could convey the long-term  behavioral and biochemical consequences of early stressors. Depending on the  timing, quality, quantity, and degree of repetition, maternal deprivation stress  in the neonatal rodent can be associated with lifelong anxiety-like behaviors,  increases in stress hormones and peptides. and proneness to drug and alcohol  administration, in association with acute changes in the rate of neurogenesis  and apoptosis (preprogrammed cell death) and decrements in neurotrophic factors  and signal transduction enzymes necessary for learning and memory. Patients with  bipolar illness who have a history of early extreme adversity (physical or  sexual abuse in childhood or adolescence), compared with those without, show an  earlier onset of illness, faster cycling frequencies, increased suicidality,  more Axis I and Axis II comorbidities (including alcohol and substance abuse),  and more time ill in more than 2 years of prospective follow-up. These findings  are subject to a variety of interpretations, but to the extent that the more  severe course of bipolar illness characteristics are directly and causally  related to these early stressful experiences, early recognition and treatment of  high-risk children could be crucial in helping to prevent or ameliorate the  long-term adverse consequences of these stressors.

Effects of early stress on brain structure and function: implications for  understanding the relationship between child maltreatment and depression.	Kaufman J(1), Charney D.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06511, USA.  joan.kaufman@yale.edu	Child abuse is associated with markedly elevated rates of major depression (MDD)  in child, adolescentt, and adult cohorts. This article reviews preclinical  (e.g., animal) studies of the effects of early stress and studies of the  neurobiological correlates of MDD in adults and children, and it highlights  differences in the neurobiological correlates of MDD and stress at various  developmental stages. The preclinical studies demonstrate that stress early in  life can alter the development multiple neurotransmitter systems and promote  structural and functional alterations in brain regions similar to those seen in  adults with depression. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest, however, that  long-term neurobiological changes associated with early stress can be modified  by familial/genetic factors, the quality of the subsequent caregiving  environment, and pharmacological interventions. Little is known about how  developmental factors interact with experiences of early stress and these other  modifying factors. Moreover, in cases of child maltreatment, the effects of  early abuse are often exacerbated by failures in the child protection system and  repeat out-of-home placements. Given the number of factors that impact on the  long-term outcome of maltreated children, multidisciplinary research efforts are  recommended to address this problem-with foci that span from neurobiology to  social policy.

Structure and variability in the developmental trajectory of children's  externalizing problems: impact of infant attachment, maternal depressive  symptomatology, and child sex.	Munson JA(1), McMahon RJ, Spieker SJ.	Author information: (1)Center on Human Development and Disability, University of Washington, Seattle  98195-7920, USA. jeffmun@u.washington.edu	This study explores the developmental trajectory of externalizing problems in a  sample of 101 children of adolescent mothers from preschool through third grade  using hierarchical linear models (HLM). First, a detailed assessment of the  structure of the developmental trajectory of externalizing problems is provided.  Second, the impact of three risk factors (infant attachment, maternal depressive  symptomatology, and child sex) on the developmental course of externalizing  problems is assessed. Both avoidant and disorganized attachment and higher  levels of maternal depressive symptomatology were associated with higher levels  of externalizing problems at 9 years of age. Girls also showed higher  externalizing problems relative to their same-sex peers than did boys. In  addition, maternal depressive symptomatology related to the rate of change in  these problems over time: the greater the mother's depression, the faster  externalizing problems tended to increase. Although the overall level of  maternal depressive symptomatology was related to children's externalizing  problems for secure, avoidant, and disorganized groups, changes in maternal  depressive symptomatology over time predicted levels of externalizing problems  only for children with avoidant insecure attachments.

Greenberg MT(1), Speltz ML, DeKlyen M, Jones K.	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802, USA. mxg47@psu.edu	The current study utilized both variable- and person-oriented analyses to  examine correlates of early disruptive behavior problems. Participants included  80 preschool boys referred to a child psychiatry clinic and diagnosed with  oppositional defiant disorder (with or without attention-deficit hyperactivity  disorder) and 80 case-matched normal comparison boys. The study examined four  domains of correlates: vulnerable child characteristics, poor parenting  practices, insecure attachment, and adverse family ecology. Results indicated  that the combination of these factors provided relatively high sensitivity (81%)  and specificity (85%), clearly differentiating referred from comparison boys. A  dramatic increase in clinic status occurred when three or more factors were  present, and specific combinations of factors were differentially predictive of  conduct problems. However, no correlates were found to be either necessary or  sufficient for clinic status. By maintaining the integrity of individual cases,  person-oriented analyses were able to answer different questions than more  traditional variable-oriented analyses. Discussion focuses on the value of  person-oriented analyses for understanding heterogeneous clinical groups.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579401002048 PMID: 11393646 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Vagal tone, development, and Gray's motivational theory: toward an integrated  model of autonomic nervous system functioning in psychopathology.	Beauchaine T(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195-1525, USA.  tbeaucha@washington.edu	In the last decade, cardiac vagal tone has emerged as a psychophysiological  marker of many aspects of behavioral functioning in both children and adults.  Research efforts during this time have produced an extensive list of vagal tone  correlates that includes temperamental variables as well as both  anxious/internalizing and disruptive/externalizing behaviors. This potentially  confusing state of affairs is compounded by developmental shifts in vagal tone  behavior relations that to date have not been elucidated. In this paper, the  vagal tone literature is reviewed, and discrepancies, including the lack of  specificity of vagal tone as a psychophysiological marker, are clarified. Such  clarification requires that we (a) view vagal tone-behavior relations in  developmental context, (b) juxtapose vagal tone-behavior relations in typical  and atypical samples, and (c) consider the parasympathetic underpinnings of  vagal tone as but one component in a broader model of autonomic nervous system  functioning. Such a model is provided by combining Gray's motivational theory  with Porges's polyvagal theory. Together these models account for behavioral and  emotional differences in a diverse range of psychological disorders that are not  differentiated by either model alone. Moreover, use of the integrated model  offers a theory-driven approach to the study of autonomic nervous  system-behavior relations.

Poehlmann J(1), Fiese BH.	Author information: (1)Syracuse University, USA. poehlmann@waisman.wisc.edu	The present study sought to document an example of how maternal and infant  vulnerabilities interact in contributing to the quality of early attachment  relationships. Maternal depressive symptoms, neonatal health characteristics,  and infant mother attachment were assessed for 42 preterm, low birth weight  infants and 42 full-term infants at 12 months postterm. Results indicated that  preterm birth moderated the relation between maternal depressive symptoms and  quality of infant-mother attachment, even controlling for level of neonatal  health complications. Preterm infants with more symptomatic mothers were most  likely to be classified as insecurely attached to their mothers, whereas no  direct relation between subclinical depressive symptoms and attachment was found  for full-term infants.

Silk JS(1), Nath SR, Siegel LR, Kendall PC.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19122, USA.	Conceptions of mental illness in children are bound by cultural and social  conventions of what constitutes healthy and unhealthy development. To understand  current conceptualizations of disorders in children, we review the history of  these conceptualizations from three intertwined perspectives: a sociopolitical  history of American children and families, the history of the mental health  fields and scientific disciplines involved in diagnosing children, and the  evolution of children's role in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental  Disorders. We review where the field has been in its conception of childhood  mental illness throughout the past century, where we believe it is now, and  raise questions about the direction in which child diagnosis may be headed as we  enter the new millennium. We conclude with social policy recommendations based  on theory and research regarding mental disorders in children.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579400004090 PMID: 11202041 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Aube J(1), Fleury J, Smetana J.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Rochester, NY 14627, USA.	In recent years. womens' roles have changed dramatically, prompting researchers  to examine the impact of these changes on the development of women and children.  In this article, we examine three major changes that women have experienced over  the past several decades: increased participation in the paid labor force,  changes in domestic labor and child-care patterns, and increased numbers of  female-headed single-parent families. For each, we first describe the nature of  the changes that have occurred over the last 50 years. We then review research  concerning the effects of these changes on the development of women and  children. Finally, we discuss the implications for social policy that stem from  this research. It is broadly concluded that research informed by a  developmental-contextual perspective may contribute importantly to the  development of social policies focused on promoting the well-being of women and  children.

Author information: (1)Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA. elizabeth.costello@duke.edu	Children's healthy mental development has never been the focus of long-term,  committed public health policy in the way that early physical health and  development have been. We discuss four types of societal response to  illness-cure, care, control, and prevention--and trace the history of public  health in terms of its special responsibility to control and prevent disease. We  identify four periods in the history of public health: the Sanitarian era (up to  1850), the Bacterial era (1850-1950), the Behavioral era (1950-present), and the  Communitarian era (the next century). Looking at this history from the viewpoint  of the developmental psychopathology of the first 2 decades of life, we trace  progress in public health responses to children with mental illness, from a  philosophy of control by isolation toward one of preventive intervention. We  examine primary, or universal, prevention strategies that have been tried, and  we suggest some that might be worth reconsidering.

Hinshaw SP(1), Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley 94720-1650, USA.	The end of the last millennium witnessed an unprecedented degree of public  awareness regarding mental disorder as well as motivation for policy change.  Like Sartorius, we contend that the continued stigmatization of mental illness  may well be the central issue facing the field, as nearly all attendant issues  (e.g., standards of care, funding for basic and applied research efforts)  emanate from professional, societal, and personal attitudes towards persons with  aberrant behavior. We discuss empirical and narrative evidence for  stigmatization as well as historical trends regarding conceptualizations of  mental illness, including the field's increasing focus on genetic and  neurobiological causes and determinants of mental disorder. We next define  stigma explicitly, noting both the multiple levels (community, societal,  familial, individual) through which stigma operates to dehumanize and  delegitimize individuals with mental disorders and the impact of stigma across  development. Key developmental psychopathology principles are salient in this  regard. We express concern over the recent oversimplification of mental illness  as "brain disorder," supporting instead transactional models which account for  the dynamic interplay of genes, neurobiology, environment, and self across  development and which are consistent with both compassion and societal  responsibility. Finally, we consider educational and policy-related initiatives  regarding the destigmatization of mental disorder. We conclude that attitudes  and policy regarding mental disorder reflect, in microcosmic form, two crucial  issues for the next century and millennium: (a) tolerance for diversity (vs.  pressure for conformity) and (b) intentional direction of our species'  evolution, given fast-breaking genetic advances.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.  sbcamp+@pitt.edu	The early emergence and developmental implications of externalizing behavior  problems in toddlers and preschoolers are discussed with an emphasis on which  young children are truly at risk for continuing problems. The extant literature  is reviewed with a focus on the stability of early externalizing behavior and  the diverse pathways that young children, primarily boys, with early-emerging  problems may follow. Findings from a number of studies, both epidemiological and  high risk, suggest that the small subgroup of boys with multiple risk factors  that include especially high levels of early hyperactivity and aggression, and  high levels of negative parenting and family stress, are most likely to evidence  continuing problems at school entry. Sociodemographic and neighborhood  influences are also discussed, as are implications for future research and  policy.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579400003114 PMID: 11014748 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Zahn-Waxler C(1), Klimes-Dougan B, Slattery MJ.	Author information: (1)Section on Developmental Psychopathology, Child Psychiatry Branch, National  Institute of Mental Health Bethesada, MD 20892, USA.	The focus of this article is on internalizing problems that are experienced by  children and adolescents. We provide an historical perspective, selectively  examine the current state of knowledge, consider advances and gaps in what is  known, and identify new research directions. Diagnosis, epidemiology, theory,  and research first are considered separately for anxiety and depressive  disorders. These internalizing problems, however, whether clinical or  subclinical, share many common features and show high comorbidity rates. We  emphasize the importance of systematic analysis of comorbid anxiety and  depression, including their comorbidity with externalizing problems. This could  lead to more valid classification of subtypes of internalizing problems and  further an understanding of the diverse conditions that constitute internalized  distress. We highlight the need to study anxiety and depression within a  developmental psychopathology framework, as well as to include both categorical  and dimensional assessments of these problems in the same research designs. This  will be essential for understanding the complex interplay of biological and  environmental processes that contribute to the emergence, progression, and  amelioration of internalizing problems over time.

Author information: (1)Weill Medical College of Cornell University, USA. mip2003@med.cornell.edu	Child development involves both reactive and self-regulatory mechanisms that  children develop in conjunction with social norms. A half-century of research  has uncovered aspects of the physical basis of attentional networks that produce  regulation, and has given us some knowledge of how the social environment may  alter them. In this paper, we discuss six forms of developmental plasticity  related to aspects of attention. We then focus on effortful or executive aspects  of attention, reviewing research on temperamental individual differences and  important pathways to normal and pathological development. Pathologies of  development may arise when regulatory and reactive systems fail to reach the  balance that allows for both self-expression and socially acceptable behavior.  It remains a challenge for our society during the next millennium to obtain the  information necessary to design systems that allow a successful balance to be  realized by the largest possible number of children.

Author information: (1)University College London, Psychoanalysis Unit, UK. p.fonagy@ucl.ac.uk	Psychoanalysis ushered in this century. Will its influence on developmental  psychopathology end in the next? The paper explores some critical obstacles in  the way of psychodynamic research, including the fragmentation of psychoanalytic  theory. the relative independence of theory from its clinical and empirical  base, the predominance of inductive scientific logic, the polymorphous use of  terms, the privacy of clinical data, the dominance of the reconstructionist  stance, and the isolation of psychoanalysis from psychology and neurobiology.  Notwithstanding these limitations, core psychoanalytic precepts are not only  consistent with some of the most important advances of the last decade but may  also be helpful in elaborating these new discoveries in the next century.  Psychoanalysis is centered on the notion that complex, conflicting, unconscious  representations of mental states constitute a key facet of normal and abnormal  development. This notion retains its power, and deserves a prominent position  among the major frames of reference to guide developmental science in the next  century.

Author information: (1)University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262, USA.	This essay explores implications of current trends in developmental science for  understanding psychopathology at the dawn of the new millennium. Over the past  half century, it has become clear that uniform and general principles of  development (i.e., those that are applicable at all times, to all people, and in  all places) will be of limited utility in understanding the processes of  greatest interest in development and psychopathology. Instead, such processes  are characterized by complexly organized individuals engaged in developmental  transactions within multiple contexts (ranging from the biological environment  of neurons to the cultural systems of meaning that shape people's lives). These  transactions in turn often yield variable outcomes. In order to portray how we  have come to this conclusion, we first provide a view of contemporary research  in three areas of early development: the biology of the developing brain, the  complexities of early emotional development, and the cultural contexts of child  development. We then trace how an increasing appreciation of organized  complexity, developmental transactions, and the meaning of context have played  out in the emerging field of infant mental health before closing with our vision  of new opportunities for the study of experience in the midst of variation.

Among these are the  blurring of the division between mental illness and mental health, the need to  attend to patterns of adaptation rather than personality traits, and the  powerful influences of the social world on individual development. Current  developmental views place deviancy in the dynamic relation between individuals  and their contexts. At another level, when we view the history of developmental  psychopathology, dialectical developmental processes are evident as we trace how  patterns of adaptation of researchers, expressed in theoretical models and  empirical paradigms. increasingly have come to match the complexities of human  mental health and illness.

Rudolph KD(1), Hammen C, Burge D, Lindberg N, Herzberg D, Daley SE.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Champaign  61820, USA. krudolph@uiuc.edu	The validity of a developmentally based life-stress model of depression was  evaluated in 88 clinic-referred youngsters. The model focused on (a) the role of  child-environment transactions, (b) the specificity of stress-psychopathology  relations, and (c) the consideration of both episodic and chronic stress.  Semistructured diagnostic and life-stress interviews were administered to  youngsters and their parents. As predicted, in the total sample child depression  was associated with interpersonal episodic and chronic stress, whereas  externalizing disorder was associated with noninterpersonal episodic and chronic  stress. However, the pattern of results differed somewhat in boys and girls.  Youngsters with comorbid depression and externalizing disorder tended to  experience the highest stress levels. Support was obtained for a  stress-generation model of depression, wherein children precipitate stressful  events and circumstances. In fact, stress that was in part dependent on  children's contribution distinguished best among diagnostic groups, whereas  independent stress had little discriminative power. Results suggest that  life-stress research may benefit from the application of transactional models of  developmental psychopathology, which consider how children participate in the  construction of stressful environments.

School-aged children's vulnerability to depressive symptomatology: the role of  attachment security, maternal depressive symptomatology, and economic risk.	Graham CA(1), Easterbrooks MA.	Author information: (1)Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA.	The influences of three risk factors (insecure attachment, maternal depressive  symptoms, and economic risk) on children's depressive symptomatology were  examined. Subjects were 85 children from a range of income levels; all subjects  were between 7 and 9 years of age. Children's depressive symptomatology was  assessed with the Dimensions of Depression Profile for Children and Adolescents.  Results indicated that children at high economic risk were more likely to  exhibit depressive symptomatology than were children at low economic risk.  Security of attachment was significantly related to children's depressive  symptomatology. In addition, a significant relation was noted between children's  depressive symptomatology and the depressive symptomatology of their mothers.  Contrary to expectations, no significant relation was found between maternal  depressive symptomatology and security of attachment. A multiple regression  analysis revealed that security of attachment, maternal depressive  symptomatology, and economic risk accounted for 47% of the variability in  children's depression scores. Secure attachment served as a buffer; economic  risk was associated with depressive symptoms only among insecurely attached  children.

Conversational responsiveness in specific language impairment: evidence of  disproportionate pragmatic difficulties in a subset of children.	Bishop DV(1), Chan J, Adams C, Hartley J, Weir F.	Author information: (1)Department of Experimental Psychology, Oxford University, UK.  dorothy.bishop@psy.ox.ac.uk	Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2008 Winter;20(1):399.	Eighteen children with specific language impairment (SLI), from 6 to 8 years of  age, were compared with 9 control children matched on age and nonverbal ability  (CA controls) and with 9 younger control children of comparable language level  (LA controls). Half of the SLI group were rated on a teacher checklist as having  pragmatic difficulties: these were referred to as the pragmatic language  impairment (PLI) group; the remainder were the typical (SLI-T) group. Children's  responses to adult soliciting utterances were compared. All children usually  responded to conversational solicitations, but children in the PLI group were  more likely than control children to give no response, and they also made very  little use of nonverbal responses, such as nodding. Nonverbal responding was  closely related to the quality of children's responses. Children who failed to  use nonverbal responses also had a relatively high level of pragmatically  inappropriate responses that were not readily accounted for in terms of limited  grammar or vocabulary. This study lends support to the notion that there is a  subset of the language-impaired population who have broader communicative  impairments, extending beyond basic difficulties in mastering language form,  reflecting difficulty in responding to and expressing communicative intents. The  analytic methods developed for this project have promise for the study of  pragmatic difficulties in other clinical groups.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579400002042 PMID: 10847623 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Stovall KC(1), Dozier M.	Author information: (1)University of Delaware, Newark, USA.	This paper presents single-subject analyses of newly developing attachment  relationships in 10 foster infant-caregiver dyads. Using a diary methodology, at  least 2 months of daily data were provided by foster parents on infants'  attachment behaviors. Foster infant attachment was also assessed using the  Strange Situation. Foster mother state of mind regarding attachment was measured  using the Adult Attachment Interview. For eight infants, diary data revealed  predominant patterns of attachment behavior emerging within 2 months of  placement. In most cases, diary data predicted Strange Situation  classifications. Both Strange Situation and diary data indicated that the three  children placed in foster care before 12 months of age with foster parents  having primary or secondary autonomous states of mind were classified as having  secure attachments. The five children placed after 12 months of age showed  predominantly insecure attachment behavior in the diary and were classified as  insecure in the Strange Situation. Contingency analyses of behavioral sequences  reported in the diary revealed that foster parents tended to complement their  foster childrens' attachment behaviors.

Aguilar B(1), Sroufe LA, Egeland B, Carlson E.	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.	Moffitt's theory regarding two types of adolescent antisocial behavior was  investigated using a prospective, longitudinal study of normal and abnormal  development in a primarily low socioeconomic status, ethnically diverse sample.  Results supported the presence of an early-onset/persistent (EOP) group and an  adolescence-onset (AO) group. Groups were most reliably and significantly  distinguished by indices of socioemotional history within the first 3 years, but  no significant differences were found on early measures of temperament or  neuropsychological functioning. EOPs scored significantly lower than other  groups on measures of neuropsychological functioning only during late childhood  and adolescence, suggesting that the declines in verbal functioning that have  been so reliably found in this and other samples of early-starting antisocial  adolescents are progressive and consequent to adverse experience. In  adolescence, AOs were significantly more likely to report high levels of  internalizing symptoms and life stress, suggesting that AO antisocial behavior  is not a benign phenomenon. Implications of these findings for etiologic  theories of adolescent antisocial behavior are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579400002017 PMID: 10847620 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Patterson GR(1), DeGarmo DS, Knutson N.	Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center, Eugene 97401, USA. carleenr@oslc.org	We hypothesized that hyperactivity defines the first stage and that antisocial  problems define a second stage in a progression that leads eventually to  early-onset delinquency. As expected, a structural equation model (SEM) showed  that a latent construct for hyperactivity was significantly related to a latent  construct for antisocial problems. We hypothesized that this path reflected a  shared mechanism, disrupted parental discipline. A second SEM showed that the  relation between hyperactivity and antisocial behavior really reflected a shared  disruption in parental discipline. A third SEM showed that having antisocial  parents was uniquely correlated with antisocial children but not with  hyperactivity. A fourth SEM showed that early-onset delinquency was predicted by  a latent construct for antisocial child; but when this was partialed out, the  contribution for hyperactivity was nonsignificant.

Brook JS(1), Kessler RC, Cohen P.	Author information: (1)Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.	Although it is well documented that intrapersonal and interpersonal risk factors  are related to the frequency of marijuana use, much less is known about the  initiation of marijuana use. This paper reports on a longitudinal study of the  personality, family, peer, and ecological predictors of marijuana onset.  Survival analysis was applied to a sample of nonusers of illegal drugs, followed  from age 9 years to the 20s. The major findings indicate that (a) youngsters who  are unconventional are at a higher risk for marijuana initiation; (b) youngsters  who associate with peers who use marijuana or who smoke tobacco themselves are  at increased risk for marijuana initiation; (c) youngsters who identify with  their parents are less likely to begin marijuana use; and (d) the predictors  related to marijuana onset emerged during preadolescence, early adolescence,  middle adolescence, late adolescence, and the 20s. Results are discussed within  the framework of a family interactional perspective of development. Implications  for prevention are discussed.

Author information: (1)Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027-6696, USA.	Objectives in this research were to examine contextual differences in correlates  of substance use among high school students. The focus was on two broad  categories of adjustment indices: personal psychopathology (internalizing and  externalizing problems) and behaviors reflecting social competence (academic  achievement, teacher-rated classroom behaviors, and peer acceptance or  rejection). Associations between drug use and each of these constructs were  examined in two sociodemographically disparate groups: teens from affluent,  suburban families (n = 264), and low socioeconomic status adolescents from  inner-city settings (n = 224). Results indicated that suburban youth reported  significantly higher levels of substance use than inner-city youth. In addition,  their substance use was more strongly linked with subjectively perceived  maladjustment indices. Comparable negative associations involving grades and  teacher-rated behaviors were found in both groups, and among suburban males  only, substance use showed robust positive associations with acceptance by  peers. Results are discussed in terms of developmental perspectives on  adolescent deviance, contextual socializing forces, and implications for  preventive interventions and treatment.

Author information: (1)University of Alabama at Birmingham, Department of Psychology, 35294-1107,  USA.	This study of over 1,000 adolescents focused on common and distinctive  correlates of four subgroups--no problem, depressed only, heavy drinking only,  and mixed (depressed and heavy drinking). Correlates were evaluated from the  domains of personal dispositions (e.g., temperament), interpersonal relations  (e.g., parent and peer), stressful life events, and other problem behaviors  (e.g., delinquency, substance use). The no-problem subgroup differed from the  other three subgroups in the direction of healthier functioning on almost all  measures. The mixed subgroup reported the most pervasive, low levels of  functioning, with the highest levels of childhood externalizing problems and  stressful life events, the lowest levels of family social support, and high  levels of delinquency and substance use. The depressed-only subgroup reported a  more internalized pattern characterized by childhood avoidance problems, a  difficult temperament (e.g., inflexibility, withdrawal, low task orientation),  interpersonal stressors, and poor coping strategies. The heavy-drinking-only  subgroup was characterized by higher drinking levels by primary caregivers and  lower levels of family cohesion as reported by primary caregivers. The 1-year  prospective findings were generally consistent with the concurrent findings in  that variables that were associated with transitions toward and away from  depression and heavy drinking were associated with specific transitions (e.g.,  childhood externalizing problems were associated with the transition from no  problem to heavy drinking).

White HR(1), Loeber R, Stouthamer-Loeber M, Farrington DP.	Author information: (1)Center of Alcohol Studies, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8001,  USA.	This study examined the developmental associations between substance use and  violence. We examined the trends in each behavior throughout adolescence, how  the behaviors covaried over time, and the symmetry of associations taking into  account frequency and severity of each behavior. We also examined whether  changes in one behavior affected changes in the other behavior over time. Six  years of annual data were analyzed for 506 boys who were in the seventh grade at  the first assessment. Concurrent associations between frequency of substance use  and violence were relatively strong throughout adolescence and were somewhat  stronger for marijuana than alcohol, especially in early adolescence. Type or  severity of violence was not related to concurrent alcohol or marijuana  frequency, but severity of drug use was related to concurrent violence  frequency. Depending, to some degree, on the age of the subjects, the  longitudinal relationships between substance use and violence were reciprocal  during adolescence and slightly stronger for alcohol and violence than for  marijuana and violence. Further, increases in alcohol use were related to  increases in violence: however, when early alcohol use was controlled, increases  in marijuana use were not related to increases in violence. Only in early  adolescence was the longitudinal relationship between marijuana use and later  violence especially strong. The strength of the longitudinal associations  between violence and substance use did not change when common risk factors for  violence and substance use were controlled. Overall, the data lend more support  for a reciprocal than for a unidirectional association between substance use and  violence. Prevention efforts should be directed at aggressive males who are  multiple-substance users in early adolescence.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579499002321 PMID: 10624726 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Research Institute on Addictions, Buffalo, NY, USA. eiden@ria.org	The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between fathers'  alcoholism and the quality of parent-infant interactions during free play. A  related goal was to study the potential mediating or moderating role of comorbid  parental psychopathology, such as depression and antisocial behavior, difficult  infant temperament, and parental aggression. The sample consisted of 204  families with 12-month-old infants (104 alcoholic and 100 control families),  recruited from New York State birth records. Results indicated that fathers'  alcoholism was associated with a number of other risk factors (depression,  antisocial behavior, and family aggression). Fathers' alcoholism was also  associated with more negative father-infant interactions as indicated by lower  paternal sensitivity, positive affect, verbalizations, higher negative affect,  and lower infant responsiveness among alcoholic fathers. As expected, fathers'  depression mediated the relationship between fathers' alcoholism and  sensitivity, while maternal depression mediated the association between maternal  alcohol problems and maternal sensitivity. Parents' psychopathology did not  moderate the association between alcoholism and parent-infant interactions. The  results from the present study suggest that the origins of risk for later  maladjustment among children of alcoholic fathers are apparent as early as  infancy and highlight the role of comorbid parental risk factors.

Author information: (1)Division of High-Risk Studies, Hillside Hospital, North-Shore Long Island  Jewish Health System, Glen Oaks, NY 11004, USA. cornblat@lij.edu	Attentional deficits are well-established characteristics of patients with  schizophrenia and their at-risk offspring, suggesting a biological connection  between attention and schizophrenia. The goal of this study is to clarify the  developmental role of attention in the illness. Data has been collected from 87  subjects at high and low risk for schizophrenia who have participated in the New  York High-Risk Project from 1977 to the present. Individuals are considered to  be at high risk if either or both of their parents has schizophrenia. Analyses  of attention and global behaviors, measured at intervals from about 12 to 26  years of age, indicate (a) attentional deficits can be reliably detected in  high-risk children who will develop future schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (the  prespectrum [PSP] group); (b) these deficits are stable, enduring over time, and  appear to reflect a compromised attentional capacity; (c) attention is not  affected by the onset of illness in the PSP group; (d) for all subjects,  attention and global behaviors follow independent developmental pathways; and  (e) behavioral difficulties, but not attention deficits, appear to be highly  sensitive to environmental factors, especially rearing by a mentally ill parent.  It is concluded that in PSP individuals impaired attention probably results from  prenatal developmental abnormalities (possibly on the cellular level) and is  likely to be a marker of a biological vulnerability to schizophrenia. In  addition, attentional deficits, as opposed to early behavioral difficulties, are  concluded to be a useful first step in screening for youngsters in need of early  intervention.

Although there is some degree of plasticity in the cortex  during early postnatal life in the human infant, this plasticity is constrained  by various factors. Three working hypotheses about postnatal cortical  specialization of function are advanced, and some specific predictions about the  limits and extent of plasticity are assessed through both empirical evidence  from infants and simulations on simple cortical network models.

Dramatic gains in knowledge have been made in the fields of neuroscience, human  development, and developmental psychopathology during the past quarter of a  century. Despite the advances that have been achieved in each discipline  separately, considerably less progress has occurred in understanding the  relation between neurobiological and behavioral development in normal and  atypical populations. Research has increasingly demonstrated that abnormalities  that occur early in development may result in the emergence of aberrant neural  circuitry that eventuates in relatively enduring forms of psychopathology.  Knowledge of normal neurobiological development provides a powerful foundation  for understanding the contributions that neurodevelopmental processes make to  the etiology and sequelae of psychopathology across the life course. An  integrated perspective wherein an appreciation of the complex neural,  psychological, and social-contextual processes that cohere to bring about normal  and pathological outcomes is necessary in order to advance understanding of the  genesis and epigenesis of mental disorders. Such an approach will require a  reduction of the schisms that so often separate neurobiological and behavioral  research.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579499002114 PMID: 10532615 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Christchurch Health & Development Study, Christchurch School of Medicine, New  Zealand. lwoodward@chmeds.ac.nz	The relationship between conduct problems at age 8 years and teenage pregnancy  by the age of 18 years was analyzed in a birth cohort of 491 girls. A  statistically significant association was found between early conduct problems  and later risk of teenage pregnancy, with girls in the most disturbed 10% of the  cohort having a pregnancy rate that was 5.3 times higher (p < .001) than the  rate found in the least disturbed 50% of the cohort. The elevated risk of  teenage pregnancy amongst girls with early conduct problems was in part,  explained by social and family factors that were correlated with early conduct  problems, and in part, by a causal chain process in which early conduct problems  were associated with increased rates of risk taking behaviors in adolescence,  which in turn led to an increased risk of teenage pregnancy. These results  suggest that the higher rate of teenage pregnancy among girls with early conduct  problems reflected both their relatively disadvantaged family backgrounds and  their tendencies to risk taking behavior in adolescence.

Author information: (1)University of Alabama, USA. psilver@unt.edu	Recent research has suggested that there are two distinct trajectories for the  development of antisocial behavior in boys: a childhood-onset pathway and an  adolescent-onset pathway. After reviewing the limited available research on  antisocial girls, we propose that this influential method of conceptualizing the  development of severe antisocial behavior may not apply to girls without some  important modifications. Antisocial girls appear to show many of the correlates  that have been associated with the childhood-onset pathway in boys, and they  tend to show impaired adult adjustment, which is also similar to boys in the  childhood-onset pathway. However, antisocial girls typically show an  adolescent-onset to their antisocial behavior. We have proposed that these girls  show a third developmental pathway which we have labeled the "delayed-onset"  pathway. This model rests on the assumption that many of the putative pathogenic  mechanisms that contribute to the development of antisocial behavior in girls,  such as cognitive and neuropsychological deficits, a dysfunctional family  environment, and/or the presence of a callous and unemotional interpersonal  style, may be present in childhood, but they do not lead to severe and overt  antisocial behavior until adolescence. Therefore, we propose that the  delayed-onset pathway for girls is analogous to the childhood-onset pathway in  boys and that there is no analogous pathway in girls to the adolescent-onset  pathway in boys. Although this model clearly needs to be tested in future  research, it highlights the need to test the applicability of current  theoretical models for explaining the development of antisocial behavior in  girls.

Miller-Johnson S(1), Winn DM, Coie J, Maumary-Gremaud A, Hyman C, Terry R,  Lochman J.	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA. sharimj@acpub.unc.edu	The role of peer relations in childhood and behavioral and family  characteristics in early adolescence as risk factors for adolescent childbearing  was investigated. Sociometric surveys across third, fourth, and fifth grade and  parent and child measures of behavioral and family functioning at sixth and  eighth grade were collected in a lower income, urban sample of 308 African  American females. Results replicated earlier findings on the role of childhood  aggression as a predictor of teen motherhood. In addition, girls who displayed  stable patterns of childhood aggression were at significantly higher risk not  only to have children as teenagers but to have more children and to have  children at younger ages. Results also indicated that females who were depressed  in midadolescence were at greater risk to become parents between age 15 and 19  years. These findings demonstrate the need to take a differentiated approach to  understanding teen childbearing and varying developmental pathways in the  prediction of teen motherhood.

Theory of mind and emotion-recognition functioning in autistic spectrum  disorders and in psychiatric control and normal children.	Buitelaar JK(1), van der Wees M, Swaab-Barneveld H, van der Gaag RJ.	Author information: (1)University of Utrecht, The Netherlands.	The hypothesis was tested that weak theory of mind (ToM) and/or emotion  recognition (ER) abilities are specific to subjects with autism. Differences in  ToM and ER performance were examined between autistic (n = 20), pervasive  developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) (n = 20), psychiatric  control (n = 20), and normal children (n = 20). The clinical groups were matched  person-to-person on age and verbal IQ. We used tasks for the matching and the  context recognition of emotional expressions, and a set of first- and  second-order ToM tasks. Autistic and PDD-NOS children could not be significantly  differentiated from each other, nor could they be differentiated from the  psychiatric controls with a diagnosis of ADHD (n = 9). The psychiatric controls  with conduct disorder or dysthymia performed about as well as normal children.  The variance in second-order ToM performance contributed most to differences  between diagnostic groups.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579499001947 PMID: 10208355 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Lengua LJ(1), Sandler IN, West SG, Wolchik SA, Curran PJ.	Author information: (1)University of Washington, Department of Psychology, Seattle 98195, USA.	A model of the effects of children's temperament (negative and positive  emotionality, impulsivity and attention focusing) on post-divorce threat  appraisals, coping (active and avoidant), and psychological symptoms (depression  and conduct problems) was investigated. The study utilized a sample of 223  mothers and children (ages 9 to 12 years) who had experienced divorce within the  last two years. Evidence was found of direct effects of child-report negative  emotionality on children's threat perceptions and of child-report positive  emotionality and impulsivity on children's coping. Indirect effects of negative  emotionality on active and avoidant coping through threat appraisal were found.  Direct effects of the temperament variables on symptoms were also found. Cross  group analyses indicated that the models were robust to age differences, but  gender differences were found in the relation between negative emotionality and  depression. The results of this study indicate that temperament and threat  appraisals are important predictors of children's post-divorce symptoms, and  that temperament is a predictor of children's appraisal and coping process.

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis  55455-0345, USA. pbauer@maroon.tc.umn.edu	Of major interest to those concerned with early mnemonic process and function is  the question of whether early memories likely encoded without the benefit of  language later are accessible to verbal report. In the context of a controlled  laboratory study, we examined this question in children who were 16 and 20  months at the time of exposure to specific target events and who subsequently  were tested for their memories of the events after a delay of either 6 or 12  months (at 22-32 months) and then again at 3 years. At the first delayed-recall  test, children evidenced memory both nonverbally and verbally. Nonverbal  mnemonic expression was related to age at the time of test; verbal mnemonic  expression was related to verbal fluency at the time of test. At the second  delayed-recall test, children evidenced continued accessibility of their early  memories. Verbal mnemonic expression was related to previous mnemonic  expression, both nonverbal and verbal, each of which contributed unique  variance. The relevance of these findings on memory for controlled laboratory  events for issues of memory for traumatic experiences is discussed.

A developmental psychopathology framework, with its emphasis on an  interdisciplinary perspective, the interplay between work conducted with normal  and atypical populations, and its focus on investigating functioning in multiple  domains of development concurrently, possesses significant potential for  advancing work on memory and trauma. A brief historical overview of memory and  trauma is provided. Significant issues are highlighted that must be confronted  in order to advance the understanding of the effects of trauma on memory and the  utility of a developmental psychopathology perspective for informing research  efforts is examined. The implications of a developmental psychopathology  perspective for guiding research, clinical, and social policy initiatives of  relevance to trauma and memory are discussed.

Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group.	Stormshak EA(1), Bierman KL.	Author information: (1)The Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802, USA.	Based upon developmental models of disruptive behavior problems, this study  examined the hypothesis that the nature of a child's externalizing problems at  home may be important in predicting the probability of and nature of school  adjustment problems at school entry. Parent ratings were collected for a sample  of 631 behaviorally disruptive children using the Child Behavior Checklist.  Confirmatory factor analyses revealed differentiated ratings of oppositional,  aggressive, and hyperactive/inattentive behaviors at home. Teacher and peer  nominations assessed school adjustment at the end of first grade. As expected  from a developmental perspective, aggressive behaviors indicated more severe  dysfunction and were more likely to generalize to the school setting than were  oppositional behaviors. Hyperactive/inattentive behaviors at home led to more  classroom disruption than did aggressive or oppositional behaviors. Co-occurring  patterns of oppositional/aggressive and hyperactive/inattentive behaviors were  more common than were single-problem patterns, and were associated with broad  dysfunction in the social and classroom contexts. The results were interpreted  within a developmental framework, in which oppositional, aggressive, and  hyperactive/inattentive behaviors may reflect distinct (as well as shared)  developmental processes that have implications for the home-to-school  generalization of behavior problems and subsequent school adjustment.

Family systems and adolescent development: shared and nonshared risk and  protective factors in nondivorced and remarried families.	O'Connor TG(1), Hetherington EM, Reiss D.	Author information: (1)Institute of Psychiatry, Department of Psychology, London, UK.  spjwtoc@iop.bpmf.ac.uk	The primary goal of this research is to increase the goodness-of-fit between the  theoretical tenets of family systems theory and quantitative methods used to  test systems hypotheses. A family systems perspective is applied to two specific  research questions concerning family influences on adolescent development: To  what extent are familial risk and protective factors for psychopathology and  competence shared or not shared by siblings and are different family  relationship patterns associated with optimal adolescent adjustment in  nondivorced and remarried families? Multirater and multimethod data from a  national sample of 516 nondivorced and remarried families from the Nonshared  Environment and Adolescent Development (NEAD) project were examined using a  combination of cluster, factor, and regression analyses. Results indicated that  the effects of an individual relationship on adolescent adjustment is moderated  by the larger network of relationships in which it is embedded. Evidence for  nonshared familial processes in predicting adolescent psychopathology was also  found but only in a subset of families, and the mechanisms of influence were  neither main effects nor linear, as has been assumed by research to date.  Results are discussed in light of family systems models of relationship  influence on development. These results illustrate how family systems theory  provides a specific example of contextualism as regards the development of  psychopathology in adolescence.

Academic and emotional functioning in early adolescence: longitudinal relations,  patterns, and prediction by experience in middle school.	Roeser RW(1), Eccles JS, Sameroff AJ.	Author information: (1)Stanford University, CA 94305, USA. rroeser@leland.stanford.edu	Adopting a motivational perspective on adolescent development, these two  companion studies examined the longitudinal relations between early adolescents'  school motivation (competence beliefs and values), achievement, emotional  functioning (depressive symptoms and anger), and middle school perceptions using  both variable- and person-centered analytic techniques. Data were collected from  1041 adolescents and their parents at the beginning of seventh and the end of  eight grade in middle school. Controlling for demographic factors, regression  analyses in Study 1 showed reciprocal relations between school motivation and  positive emotional functioning over time. Furthermore, adolescents' perceptions  of the middle school learning environment (support for competence and autonomy,  quality of relationships with teachers) predicted their eighth grade motivation,  achievement, and emotional functioning after accounting for demographic and  prior adjustment measures. Cluster analyses in Study 2 revealed several  different patterns of school functioning and emotional functioning during  seventh grade that were stable over 2 years and that were predictably related to  adolescents' reports of their middle school environment. Discussion focuses on  the developmental significance of schooling for multiple adjustment outcomes  during adolescence.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579498001631 PMID: 9635227 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Maternal depressive disorder and contextual risk: contributions to the  development of attachment insecurity and behavior problems in toddlerhood.	Cicchetti D(1), Rogosch FA, Toth SL.	Author information: (1)University of Rochester, USA.	Research has shown that offspring of depressed caregivers are at increased risk  for maladaptive development and emotional difficulties. Specifically, infants  and toddlers of depressed mothers have been shown to evidence higher percentages  of insecure attachments and more behavioral difficulties than offspring of  nondisordered mothers. However, even in studies that reveal significant  differences between children of depressed and nondepressed caregivers, a  substantial number of children with depressed caregivers do not evidence  dysfunction. Such findings have resulted in increased attention to the broader  social context in which children of depressed mothers develop. This  investigation examined the direct influences of maternal depression on child  development, as well as the role of contextual risks that may be particularly  heightened in families with depressed parents. Toddlers with depressed mothers  evidenced significantly more insecure attachments than did toddlers with  nondisordered mothers, and this difference was not accounted for by contextual  risk. In predicting child behavior problems, contextual risk was found to  mediate the relation between maternal depression and child behavior problems.  Father-report data on child behavior corroborated the mother report data.  Results are discussed in terms of the diversity of functioning in offspring of  depressed caregivers that can be attributed to varied levels of contextual risk  accompanying depression.

Author information: (1)Psychology Department, New York University, NY 10003, USA.  seidman@psych.nyu.edu	This study explored the effects of structural and experiential neighborhood  factors and developmental stage on antisocial behavior, among a sample of poor  urban adolescents in New York City. Conceptually and empirically distinct  profiles of neighborhood experience were derived from the data, based on  measures of perceived neighborhood cohesion, poverty-related hassles, and  involvement in neighborhood organizations and activities. Both the profiles of  neighborhood experience and a measure of census-tract-level neighborhood hazard  (poverty and violence) showed relationships to antisocial behavior. Contrary to  expectation, higher levels of antisocial behavior were reported among  adolescents residing in moderate-structural-risk neighborhoods than those in  high-structural-risk neighborhoods. This effect held only for teens in middle  (not early) adolescence and was stronger for teens perceiving their  neighborhoods as hassling than for those who did not. Implications for future  research and preventive intervention are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579498001606 PMID: 9635224 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

An ecological-transactional analysis of children and contexts: the longitudinal  interplay among child maltreatment, community violence, and children's  symptomatology.	Lynch M(1), Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, USA.	Cicchetti and Lynch have conceptualized ecological contexts as consisting of  nested levels with varying degrees of proximity to the individual. These levels  of the environment interact and transact with each other over time in shaping  individual development and adaptation. With a sample of maltreated (n = 188) and  nonmaltreated (n = 134) children between the ages of 7 and 12 years, this  investigation employed a 1-year longitudinal design to conduct an  ecological-transactional analysis of the mutual relationships among community  violence, child maltreatment, and children's functioning over time. Indicators  of children's functioning were externalizing and internalizing behavior problems  and self-rated traumatic stress reactions, depressive symptomatology, and  self-esteem. Either full or partial support was obtained for the study's primary  hypotheses. Rates of maltreatment, particularly physical abuse, were related to  levels of child-reported violence in the community. In addition, child  maltreatment and exposure to community violence were related to different  aspects of children's functioning. Specific effects were observed for neglect  and sexual abuse and for witnessing and being victimized by violence in the  community. Finally, there was evidence that children and their contexts mutually  influence each other over time. Results were discussed within the framework of  an ecological-transactional model of development.	DOI: 10.1017/s095457949800159x PMID: 9635223 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Korbin JE(1), Coulton CJ, Chard S, Platt-Houston C, Su M.	Author information: (1)Dept. of Anthropology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106,  USA.	Although it is well documented that child maltreatment exerts a deleterious  impact on child adaptation, much less is known about the precise etiological  pathways that eventuate in child abuse and neglect. This paper reports on a  multimethod ecological study of the relationship between neighborhood structural  factors and child maltreatment reports in African American and European American  census tracts. The study had two major components. First, in an aggregate  analysis, the effects of four measures of community structure (impoverishment,  child care burden, instability, and geographic isolation) on child maltreatment  report rates were examined separately for predominantly African American (n =  94) and predominantly European American (n = 189) census tracts. Impoverishment  in particular had a significantly weaker effect on maltreatment rates in African  American than in European American neighborhoods. Second, focused ethnographies  were conducted in four selected census tracts with child maltreatment report  rates in the highest and lowest quartiles. Ethnographic data point to the  importance of the social fabric in accounting for differences in child  maltreatment report rates by predominant neighborhood ethnicity.

The effect of the level of aggression in the first grade classroom on the course  and malleability of aggressive behavior into middle school.	Kellam SG(1), Ling X, Merisca R, Brown CH, Ialongo N.

This paper is on the influences of the classroom context on the course and  malleability of aggressive behavior from entrance into first grade through the  transition into middle school. Nineteen public elementary schools participated  in developmental epidemiologically based preventive trials in first and second  grades, one of which was directed at reducing aggressive, disruptive behavior.  At the start of first grade, schools and teachers were randomly assigned to  intervention or control conditions. Children within each school were assigned  sequentially to classrooms from alphabetized lists, followed by checking to  insure balanced assignment based on kindergarten behavior. Despite these  procedures, by the end of first quarter, classrooms within schools differed  markedly in levels of aggressive behavior. Children were followed through sixth  grade, where their aggressive behavior was rated by middle school teachers.  Strong interactive effects were found on the risk of being highly aggressive in  middle school between the level of aggressive behavior in the first grade  classrooms and each boy's own level of aggressive, disruptive behavior in first  grade. The more aggressive first grade boys who were in higher aggressive first  grade classrooms were at markedly increased risk, compared both to the median  first grade boys, and compared to aggressive males in lower aggressive first  grade classrooms. Boys were already behaving more aggressively than girls in  first grade; and no similar classroom aggression effect was found among girls,  although girls' own aggressive behavior did place them at increased risk. The  preventive intervention effect, already reported elsewhere to reduce aggressive  behavior among the more aggressive males, appeared to do so by reducing high  levels of classroom aggression. First grade males' own poverty level was  associated with higher risk of being more aggressive, disruptive in first grade,  and thereby increased their vulnerability to classroom level of aggression. Both  boys and girls in schools in poor communities were at increased risk of being  highly aggressive in middle school regardless of their levels of aggressive  behavior in first grade. These results are discussed in terms of life  course/social field theory as applied to the role of contextual influences on  the development and etiology of severe aggressive behavior.

Author information: (1)Division of Health and Medical Sciences, School of Public Health, University  of California, Berkeley 94720-1190, USA.	Accumulating evidence suggests that social contexts in early life have important  and complex effects on childhood psychopathology. Spurred by the lack of an  explicit operational definition that could guide the study of such effects, we  define a social context operationally as "a set of interpersonal conditions,  relevant to a particular behavior or disorder and external to, but shaped and  interpreted by, the individual child." Building on this definition, we offer a  series of recommendations for future research, based on five theoretically  derived propositions: (a) Contexts are nested and multidimensional; (b) contexts  broaden, differentiate, and deepen with age, becoming more specific in their  effects; (c) contexts and children are mutually determining; (d) a context's  meaning to the child determines its effects on the child and arises from the  context's ability to provide for fundamental needs; and (e) contexts should be  selected for assessment in light of specific questions or outcomes. As reflected  in an increasingly rich legacy of literature on child development and  psychopathology, social contexts appear to influence emerging mental disorders  through dynamic, bidirectional interactions with individual children. Future  research will benefit from examining not only statistical interactions between  child- and context-specific factors, but also the actual transactions between  children and contexts and the transduction of contextual influences into  pathways of biological mediation. Because adverse contexts exert powerful  effects on the mental health of children, it is important for the field to  generate new, more theoretically grounded research addressing the contextual  determinants of psychological well-being and disorder.

Wolfe DA(1), Wekerle C, Reitzel-Jaffe D, Lefebvre L.	Author information: (1)Dept. of Psychology, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.	This study sought to understand how experiences of maltreatment occurring prior  to 12 years of age affect adolescent peer and dating relationships. A  school-based sample of 15-year-olds was divided into maltreated (n = 132) and  nonmaltreated (n = 227) subgroups based on self-reported maltreatment. These two  groups were then compared on two theoretically determined dimensions of  adjustment (i.e., interpersonal sensitivity/hostility; personal resourceS) and  self- and teacher-report measures of peer and dating relationships. Findings  supported the hypothesis that maltreated youths significantly differed from  nonmaltreated youths in terms of adjustment problems as well as conflict with  dating partners and close friends. Maltreated youths reported significantly more  verbal and physical abuse both toward and by their dating partners, and were  seen by teachers as engaging in more acts of aggression and harassment toward  others. In regression analyses, the significant association between maltreatment  and dating conflict for males was strengthened by including adjustment  dimensions in the equation; for females, adjustment variables mediated the  association between maltreatment and dating conflict. Results are discussed in  relation to a maladaptive interpersonal trajectory for maltreated children,  wherein a violent interactional dynamic in adolescent close relationships may be  setting the stage for violence in intimate partnerships.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Denver, CO 80208, USA.	The organization of the adolescent self-portrait is discussed within a framework  that focuses on the construction of multiple self-representations across  different relational contexts. Contradictions between self-attributes in  different contexts create conflict, beginning in midadolescence when  cognitive-developmental structures allow one to detect but not resolve opposing  attributes. Conflict is greater across roles than within roles. Moreover, for  certain roles (e.g., self with mother vs. self with father) conflict is higher.  Females, particularly those with a feminine gender orientation, report greater  conflict involving attributes in more public contexts. Opposing self-attributes  also raise concerns for adolescents about which attributes reflect true versus  false self-behaviors. Conflict is more frequent for opposing attributes that pit  true against false self-characteristics. False self-behavior is associated with  liabilities including devaluation of false self-attributes, low self-esteem, and  depressive reactions. Perceived support across relational contexts is highly  predictive of favorable evaluations of attributes, high self-esteem, and true  self-behavior within corresponding contexts. Strategies for resolving potential  contradictions in self-attributes would appear to emerge as one moves into late  adolescence and adulthood, when multiple self-representations are perceived as  both appropriate and desirable, and the individual can achieve some degree of  integration through higher level abstractions and the narrative construction of  his or her life story.

Author information: (1)Dept. of Clinical Psychology, Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh,  Scotland.	Evidence from the evolution of human cultural behavior and learning, embryology  and genetics of the brain, and the behavior of human infants indicates that the  critical and uniquely human motives for cooperative imagination and joint  interest in objects and tasks are determined by expression of genes and  epigenetic neural systems elaboration long before birth, along with essential  peripheral organs of perception and motor expression that will serve in  communication by rhythmic facial, vocal, gestural, and body movement signals.  These cerebral motives continue to exercise their influence on neural  development and behavior throughout life, transforming the behaviors of the  developing individual through a succession of phases to which other individuals  and cultural institutions are constrained to adapt. We discuss the theory of  innate intersubjectivity and relate it to the hypothesis of an Innate Motive  Formation that emerges in brain development as regulator of morphogenesis in  neural systems, and that continues to function, postnatally, as generator of  motives and emotions by which human contacts and relationships are regulated. We  suggest that differentiates of the primary motive formation in the embryo brain  later serve to generate intelligent exploration of the objective environment and  the emergence of an additional dialogic mechanism that represents the  self-subject as a partner for an other-subject, intersubjectively.  Intersubjective communication in infancy leads, through systematic age-related  transformations of the brain and behavior, to preverbal mimetic negotiation of  cooperative awareness and joint task performance. Finally we discuss, in  relation to this theory, interpretations of faulty communication and development  at different stages of the life cycle that result from maternal postnatal  depression, autism, premature birth and schizophrenia.

Rutter M(1), Dunn J, Plomin R, Simonoff E, Pickles A, Maughan B, Ormel J, Meyer  J, Eaves L.	Author information: (1)MRC Child Psychiatry Unit, Institute of Psychiatry, London, United Kingdom.	The developmental interplay between nature and nurture is discussed, with  particular reference to implications for research in developmental  psychopathology. The general principles include individual differences in  reactivity to the environment, two-way interplay between intraindividual biology  and environmental influences, and the need to consider broader social contextual  features. Individuals actively process their experiences; they also act on their  environment to shape and select their experiences, and individual  characteristics change over time. Key findings on genetic effects include their  ubiquitous influence, the multifactorial origin of most psychopathology, the  involvement of several genes in most mental disorders, some genetic effects  operate through dimensional risk features rather than directly on disorder, some  genetic effects are dependent on gene-environment correlations and interactions,  and genetic effects increase with age. Key findings on environmental effects  include their ubiquitous influence, the genetic mediation of some supposed  environmental effects, the importance of passive gene-environment correlations,  the paucity of evidence regarding environmental effects on lifetime liability to  psychopathology, the lack of understanding of environmental effects on the  organism, and the importance of nonshared environmental effects. Research  strategies to investigate environmental risk mediation include the range of  genetically sensitive designs, migration studies, secular trend investigations,  studies of nonfamilial environments, and examination of intraindividual change  in relation to measured environmental alterations. Proximal processes involved  in person-environment interplay are discussed in relation to person-environment  interactions and evocative and active person-environment correlations.

Author information: (1)Child and Adolescent Disorders Research Branch, National Institute of Mental  Health, Rockville, MD 20857, USA.	The authors review the constraints of current mental disorder classification  systems that rely upon descriptive symptom-based approaches, and weigh the  benefits and hazards of these classification and diagnostic strategies. By  focusing principally on superficial descriptions of symptoms, current systems  fail to address the complex nature of persons' transactions within and  adaptations to difficult environments. While attempting to be atheoretical,  current systems exclude types of information that may elucidate individuals'  functioning across various contexts, often because it is difficult to obtain  such data reliably. With current approaches, misdiagnosis is likely,  particularly when diagnostic criteria are applied to persons in nonclinical  settings. Alternative approaches that take fuller advantage of clinicians'  expertise and other forms of clinical data are reviewed, and recommendations are  made for the next generation of classification systems. Application of  evolutionary theory to psychiatry and psychology, as well as development of a  theory and nosology of context in terms of persons' adaptations, are needed to  expand our knowledge of normal and abnormal human development and  psychopathology.

McGee RA(1), Wolfe DA, Wilson SK.	Author information: (1)Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, Valley Regional Hospital,  Kentville, Nova Scotia, Canada.	By adolescence, appraisal of one's past life experience becomes critical to the  stage-salient issue of identity formation. This study examined adolescents'  perceptions of their maltreatment experiences. It scrutinized the combined and  unique contribution of five maltreatment types (i.e., physical abuse, sexual  abuse, psychological abuse, neglect, and exposure to family violence) to  variance in adolescent adjustment. It was predicted that these maltreatment  types would account for significant variance in adjustment when controlling for  the context variables of age, sex, socioeconomic status, IQ, and stressful life  events. Adolescents (N = 160, aged 11-17) were randomly selected from the open  caseload of a child protection agency. Participants completed global severity  ratings regarding their experiences of the five types of maltreatment, as well  as a battery of measures assessing self- and caretaker-reported externalizing  and internalizing symptomatology. The youths' maltreatment ratings significantly  predicted self-reported adjustment, even when controlling for all context  variables. Psychological maltreatment was the most predictively potent  maltreatment type, and enhanced the predictive utility of other maltreatment  types. Significant sex differences in the sequelae of perceived maltreatment  were evident. Also, interactions between youths' ratings and those obtained from  CPS files were detected. The findings were consistent with recent research in  child maltreatment, and contribute to our understanding of developmental  psychopathology among adolescents.

Author information: (1)Psychology Department, Texas A&M University, College Station 77843-4235, USA.	Children's ratings of competence and relationship quality were used to examine  the association between idealized or inflated self-perceptions and level of  aggression. Participants were 62 aggressive and 53 nonaggressive second and  third graders. Ratings of competence were based on the Pictorial Scale of  Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young Children; ratings of  relationship quality were drawn from the Social Support Appraisals Scale and the  Network of Relationships Inventory. External ratings of competence and  relationship quality were obtained from mothers, teachers, and peers. Compared  to children who were nonaggressive, aggressive children were more likely to rate  personal competence and relationship quality in a perfect or idealized manner  and to show less differentiation in their ratings of competence and relationship  quality. Aggressive children's self-rated competence and relationship quality  were also inflated relative to the ratings made by others, whereas the  self-ratings of nonaggressive children tended to be underestimates of their  functioning. The tendency for aggressive children to idealize and to inflate  ratings of competence and relationship quality was associated with higher levels  of aggression. For aggressive children, a highly positive self-view is  construed--not as a protective factor or measurement error--but as a defensive  posture that places the child at added risk and that impedes the progress of  psychosocial interventions.

McDonough L(1), Stahmer A, Schreibman L, Thompson SJ.	Author information: (1)Department of Cognitive Science, University of California, San Diego, La  Jolla 92093-0515, USA.	Two experiments were conducted to evaluate symbolic-deficit and memory-deficit  hypotheses to account for the cognitive problems seen in children with autism.  Experiment 1 tested imitation, in immediate and deferred conditions, of familiar  actions with different sets of objects representing the developmental  progression from functional to symbolic play. The results showed that the autism  group and both their receptive language and nonverbal IQ-matched controls  imitated familiar actions with realistic objects (evidence for functional play)  and placeholder objects (evidence for symbolic play) after delays ranging from  24 hr to 3 weeks. Experiment 2 tested familiar three-step event sequences in  which a placeholder object was substituted for the second step in half the  events. The results showed that the autism group remembered as many of the  actions with the placeholder objects as their language-matched controls and as  many correctly ordered sequences, a finding that supports a symbolic-delay  (rather than deficit) hypothesis. These results were obtained in highly  structured test situations and sharply contrast with the impairments seen in  children with autism who are observed in naturalistic settings. Two  interpretations of these findings are offered. First, structured test settings  minimize distractions that typically occur in naturalistic settings that may  interfere or disrupt symbolic play in children with autism. Second, the results  are consistent with an executive function deficit in that the autistic group  demonstrated more knowledge in the test settings than they demonstrate  spontaneously in naturalistic ones.

Although children with incarcerated parents exhibit more behavior problems,  health concerns, and academic difficulties than their peers, few interventions  or resources are available to support affected children. This randomized,  controlled, multisite efficacy trial evaluated Sesame Street's "Little Children,  Big Challenges: Incarceration" initiative with children aged 3 to 8 years with a  jailed father. Seventy-one diverse children and their caregivers were randomized  to an educational outreach group (n = 32) or wait list control group (n = 39).  Researchers observed children during jail visits and interviewed caregivers by  phone 2 and 4 weeks later. The effects of the intervention on children's  behavior and emotions occurring during a jail visit depended on what children  had been told about the father's incarceration. Children who were told honest,  developmentally appropriate explanations showed less negative affect at entry,  an increase in negative affect when the intervention was administered, and a  decrease in negative affect during the visit. Intervention group children who  were told distortions, nothing, or explanations that were not developmentally  appropriate showed more negative affect initially, and their negative affect  remained relatively stable during their time in the jail. In addition, children  who were told the simple, honest truth about the parent's incarceration (a  recommendation in the educational materials) exhibited more positive affect  during the visit, with a medium effect size. Caregivers in the educational  outreach group reported more positive change in how they talked to children  about the incarceration over time compared to the control group.

Evans GW(1), De France K(2).	Author information: (1)Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA. (2)Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.	The current study assessed whether the proportion of childhood (age 0-9 years)  in poverty altered the developmental trajectories (ages 9-24) of  multimethodological indicators of psychological well-being. In addition, we  tested whether exposure to cumulative risk over time mediated the association  between poverty exposure and psychological well-being. Measures of psychological  well-being included internalizing and externalizing symptoms, a behavioral index  of learned helplessness (task persistence), and chronic physiological stress  (allostatic load). Exposure to poverty during childhood predicted the trajectory  of each development outcome: individuals with more poverty exposure during  childhood showed (a) relatively high levels of internalizing symptoms that  diminished more slowly with maturation, (b) relatively high levels of  externalizing symptoms that increased faster over time, (c) less task  persistence indicative of greater learned helplessness, and (d) higher levels of  chronic physiological stress which increased faster over time relative to  persons with less childhood poverty exposure. Trajectories of cumulative risk  exposure from physical and psychosocial surroundings from 9-24 years accounted  for the association between childhood poverty and the growth curves of  internalizing and externalizing symptoms but not for learned helplessness or  chronic physiological stress. Additional sensitivity analyses indicate that  early childhood disadvantage is particularly problematic for each outcome,  except for internalizing symptoms which seem sensitive to the combination of  early and lifetime poverty exposure. We also explored whether domains of  cumulative risk as well as two alternatives, maternal sensitivity or family  cohesion, functioned as mediators. Little evidence emerged for any of these  alternative mediating constructs.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001947 PMID: 33526153

Although there has been significant work on the association between  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and attachment orientation, this is less  the case for complex PTSD (CPTSD). The primary aim of this paper was to assess  the strength of the association between the four adult attachment styles (i.e.,  secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and fearful) and severity of CPTSD symptoms  (i.e., symptoms of PTSD and disturbances in self-organization [DSO]). We  hypothesized that attachment orientation would be more strongly associated with  DSO symptoms compared to PTSD symptoms. A trauma exposed clinical sample (N =  331) completed self-report measures of traumatic life events, CPTSD symptoms,  and attachment orientation. It was found that secure attachment and fearful  attachment were significantly associated with DSO symptoms but not with PTSD  symptoms. Dismissing attachment style was significantly associated with PTSD and  DSO symptoms. Preoccupied attachment was not significantly associated with CPTSD  symptoms. Treatment implications for CPTSD using an attachment framework are  discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001509 PMID: 33446294

The national priority to advance early detection and intervention for children  with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has not reduced the late age of ASD  diagnosis in the US over several consecutive Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) surveillance cohorts, with traditionally under-served  populations accessing diagnosis later still. In this review, we explore a  potential perceptual barrier to this enterprise which views ASD in terms that  are contradicted by current science, and which may have its origins in the  current definition of the condition and in its historical associations. To  address this perceptual barrier, we propose a re-definition of ASD in early  brain development terms, with a view to revisit the world of opportunities  afforded by current science to optimize children's outcomes despite the risks  that they are born with. This view is presented here to counter outdated notions  that potentially devastating disability is determined the moment a child is  born, and that these burdens are inevitable, with opportunities for improvement  being constrained to only alleviation of symptoms or limited improvements in  adaptive skills. The impetus for this piece is the concern that such views of  complex neurodevelopmental conditions, such as ASD, can become self-fulfilling  science and policy, in ways that are diametrically opposed to what we currently  know, and are learning every day, of how genetic risk becomes, or not,  instantiated as lifetime disabilities.

The purpose of this study was to advance the current understanding of the daily  dynamics that are involved in raising a child with Cerebral Palsy (CP).  Specifically, we examined the role of mindful parenting and of day-to-day  variation in parents' psychological needs and child behavior in explaining  day-to-day variation in parents' autonomy-supportive, psychologically  controlling, and responsive parenting behavior. Parents (N = 58) of children  with CP (Mage = 12.68 years) participated in a 7-day diary study. Multilevel  analyses indicated that parents' autonomy-supportive, psychologically  controlling, and responsive behaviors fluctuate considerably between days.  Further, daily fluctuations in both child behavior and parents' own  psychological needs were found to be associated with this daily variability in  parenting. In addition, interindividual differences in mindful parenting were  associated positively with parents' responsiveness and negatively with  psychologically controlling parenting across the week. These findings point  towards the changeability of parenting behavior among parents of a child with CP  and suggest that interventions targeting parenting behavior in the context of CP  will be most effective when taking into account both the parents' and the  child's functioning.

Negative events during childhood have deleterious correlates later in life,  including antisocial behavior. However, the mechanisms that play into this  relation are unclear. We explored deficits in neurocognitive functioning,  specifically problems in passive avoidance, a construct with elements of  inhibitory control and learning as a potential acquired mediator for the pathway  between cumulative early childhood adversity from birth to age 7 and later  antisocial behavior through age 18, using prospective longitudinal data from 585  participants. Path analyses showed that cumulative early childhood adversity  predicted impaired passive avoidance during adolescence and increased antisocial  behavior during late adolescence. Furthermore, poor neurocognition, namely,  passive avoidance, predicted later antisocial behavior and significantly  mediated the relation between cumulative early childhood adversity and later  antisocial behavior. This research has implications for understanding the  development of later antisocial behavior and points to a potential target for  neurocognitive intervention within the pathway from cumulative early childhood  adversity to later antisocial behavior.

Family sociodemographic resources moderate the path from toddlers'  hard-to-manage temperament to parental control to disruptive behavior in middle  childhood.	Kim S(1), Kochanska G(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Sociology, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea. (2)Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa  City, IA, USA.	Research inspired by ecological perspectives has amply documented broad effects  of the family's sociodemographic resources on children's outcomes, with parents'  young age, low education, and low income considered risk factors. Typically,  sociodemographic characteristics have been studied as influencing child outcomes  either directly or indirectly through parenting. We tested a more nuanced  longitudinal model in a community sample of 102 infants, mothers, and fathers.  We conceptualized family sociodemographic resources, measured as a composite of  parents' ages, education, and income, as moderating developmental cascades from  children's hard-to-manage temperament to parental power-assertive control to  children's disruptive behavior problems. Children's temperament measures  encompassed proneness to anger and inability to delay, observed at 2 and 3 years  in standard laboratory episodes. We observed parents' control at 4.5 and 5.5  years in lengthy naturalistic prohibition paradigms, and obtained parental  ratings of children's disruptive behavior at 6.5 and 8 years. As expected,  moderated mediation analyses, covarying stability of children's difficulty and  parental control, revealed that the cascade from hard-to-manage temperament to  child behavior problems, mediated by parental power-assertive control, was  present in families with relatively more disadvantaged sociodemographic  characteristics, or fewer resources, but absent in families with more  advantageous sociodemographic features, or more resources. The findings were  parallel for mother- and father-child dyads.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001664 PMCID: PMC7483242 PMID: 32133971

The current study aimed to understand the mediating and/or moderating role of  prenatal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function in the association  between maternal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and child internalizing  and externalizing behavior problems at age 4. The influence of timing and child  sex were also explored. Participants were 248 mother-child dyads enrolled in a  prospective longitudinal cohort study (the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and  Nutrition Study). Maternal ACEs were retrospectively assessed while maternal  self-reported depression and diurnal salivary cortisol were assessed  prospectively at 6-26 weeks gestation (T1) and 27-37 weeks gestation (T2).  Maternal report of child internalizing and externalizing problems was assessed  at 4 years (T3). Results revealed that there was a negative indirect association  between maternal ACEs and child internalizing behavior via a higher maternal  cortisol awakening response (CAR). Maternal diurnal cortisol slope moderated the  association between maternal ACEs and child behavior problems. Some of these  effects were dependent on child sex, such that higher ACEs and a flatter diurnal  slope at T1 was associated with more internalizing behavior in female children  and more externalizing behavior in male children. There were timing effects such  that the mediating and moderating effects were strongest at T1.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001767 PMID: 32124709

Stressful experiences affect biological stress systems, such as the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Life stress can potentially alter  regulation of the HPA axis and has been associated with poorer physical and  mental health. Little, however, is known about the relative influence of  stressors that are encountered at different developmental periods on acute  stress reactions in adulthood. In this study, we explored three models of the  influence of stress exposure on cortisol reactivity to a modified version of the  Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) by leveraging 37 years of longitudinal data in a  high-risk birth cohort (N = 112). The cumulative stress model suggests that  accumulated stress across the lifespan leads to dysregulated reactivity, whereas  the biological embedding model implicates early childhood as a critical period.  The sensitization model assumes that dysregulation should only occur when stress  is high in both early childhood and concurrently. All of the models predicted  altered reactivity, but do not anticipate its exact form. We found support for  both cumulative and biological embedding effects. However, when pitted against  each other, early life stress predicted more blunted cortisol responses at age  37 over and above cumulative life stress. Additional analyses revealed that  stress exposure in middle childhood also predicted more blunted cortisol  reactivity.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001779 PMID: 32124708

Evidence suggests that early trauma may have a negative effect on cognitive  functioning in individuals with psychosis, yet the relationship between  childhood trauma and cognition among those at clinical high risk (CHR) for  psychosis remains unexplored. Our sample consisted of 626 CHR children and 279  healthy controls who were recruited as part of the North American Prodrome  Longitudinal Study 2. Childhood trauma up to the age of 16 (psychological,  physical, and sexual abuse, emotional neglect, and bullying) was assessed by  using the Childhood Trauma and Abuse Scale. Multiple domains of cognition were  measured at baseline and at the time of psychosis conversion, using standardized  assessments. In the CHR group, there was a trend for better performance in  individuals who reported a history of multiple types of childhood trauma  compared with those with no/one type of trauma (Cohen d = 0.16). A history of  multiple trauma types was not associated with greater cognitive change in CHR  converters over time. Our findings tentatively suggest there may be different  mechanisms that lead to CHR states. Individuals who are at clinical high risk  who have experienced multiple types of childhood trauma may have more typically  developing premorbid cognitive functioning than those who reported minimal  trauma do. Further research is needed to unravel the complexity of factors  underlying the development of at-risk states.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941900155X PMID: 31959269

Foka S(1), Hadfield K(1), Pluess M(1), Mareschal I(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Biological and Experimental Psychology, Queen Mary University  of London, London, UK.	Rigorously evaluated interventions that target protective factors and positive  resources rather than ameliorating negative outcomes in child refugees are rare.  To address this, we developed and evaluated a short, group-based  resilience-building intervention called Strengths for the Journey (SFJ), which  was designed for war-affected children. We conducted a quasi-randomized pilot  study of the SFJ intervention with 72 7- to 14-year-old forcibly displaced  children (Mage = 10.76, 64.8% female) in three refugee camps in Lesvos, Greece.  Intervention effectiveness was assessed by measuring pre-post changes in  well-being, self-esteem, optimism, and depressive symptoms from before (T1) to  immediately after the intervention/wait-list task (T2). Four focus group  interviews were conducted with 31 of the participants to discuss their views on  the effects of the intervention and the continued use of the skills that were  learned. Using repeated-measures ANOVAs, we found improvements in well-being, F  (1, 46) = 42.99, ηp2 = .48, self-esteem, F (1, 56) = 29.11, ηp2 = .40, optimism,  F (1, 53) = 27.16, ηp2 = .34, and depressive symptoms, F (1, 31) = 62.14, ηp2 =  .67, in the intervention group compared with the wait-listed group (p < .05).  Focus group participants highlighted the importance of SFJ in developing a sense  of togetherness and building their strengths. Child refugees in low-resource  settings may benefit from brief, first-line interventions that target protective  factors such as well-being, hope, self-esteem, and belonging.

Pubertal development mediates the association between family environment and  brain structure and function in childhood.	Thijssen S(1)(2), Collins PF(2), Luciana M(2).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Education, and Child Studies, Erasmus University  Rotterdam, the Netherlands. (2)Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.	Psychosocial acceleration theory suggests that pubertal maturation is  accelerated in response to adversity. In addition, suboptimal caregiving  accelerates development of the amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex circuit. These  findings may be related. Here, we assess whether associations between family  environment and measures of the amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex circuit are  mediated by pubertal development in more than 2000 9- and 10-year-old children  from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study  (http://dx.doi.org/10.15154/1412097). Using structural equation modeling,  demographic, child-reported, and parent-reported data on family dynamics were  compiled into a higher level family environment latent variable. Magnetic  resonance imaging preprocessing and compilations were performed by the  Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study's data analysis core. Anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC) thickness, area, white matter fractional anisotropy,  amygdala volume, and cingulo-opercular network-amygdala resting-state functional  connectivity were assessed. For ACC cortical thickness and ACC fractional  anisotropy, significant indirect effects indicated that a stressful family  environment relates to more advanced pubertal stage and more mature brain  structure. For cingulo-opercular network-amygdala functional connectivity,  results indicated a trend in the expected direction. For ACC area, evidence for  quadratic mediation by pubertal stage was found. Sex-stratified analyses suggest  stronger results for girls. Despite small effect sizes, structural measures of  circuits important for emotional behavior are associated with family environment  and show initial evidence of accelerated pubertal development.

Bosquet Enlow M(1), Egeland B(2), Carlson E(2), Blood E(1), Wright RJ(3).	Author information: (1)Boston Children's Hospital. (2)University of Minnesota. (3)Harvard Medical School.	Evidence for the intergenerational transmission of posttraumatic stress disorder  (PTSD) is documented in the literature, although the underlying mechanisms are  poorly understood. Attachment theory provides a framework for elucidating the  ways in which maternal PTSD may increase offspring PTSD vulnerability. The  current study utilized two independent prospective data sets to test the  hypotheses that (a) maternal PTSD increases the probability of developing an  insecure mother-infant attachment relationship and (b) an insecure mother-infant  attachment relationship increases the risk of developing PTSD following trauma  exposure in later life. In the first study of urban, primarily low-income  ethnic/racial minority mothers and infants (N = 45 dyads), elevated maternal  PTSD symptoms at 6 months were associated with increased risk for an insecure,  particularly disorganized, mother-infant attachment relationship at 13 months.  In the second birth cohort of urban, low-income mothers and children (N = 96  dyads), insecure (avoidant or resistant) attachment in infancy was associated in  a dose-response manner with increased lifetime risk for a diagnosis of PTSD by  adolescence. A history of disorganized attachment in infancy predicted severity  of PTSD symptoms, including reexperiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal, and total  symptoms, at 17.5 years. In both studies, associations between attachment and  PTSD were not attributable to numerous co-occurring risk factors. The findings  suggest that promoting positive mother-child relationships in early development,  particularly in populations at high risk for trauma exposure, may reduce the  incidence of PTSD.

We studied the developmental trends of temperament and character in a  longitudinal population-based sample of Finnish men and women aged 20-45 years  using the Temperament and Character Inventory model of personality. Personality  was assessed in 1997, 2001, and 2007 (n = 2,104, 2,095, and 2,056,  respectively). Mean-level changes demonstrated qualitatively distinct  developmental patterns for character (self-directedness, cooperativeness, and  self-transcendence) and temperament (novelty seeking, harm avoidance, reward  dependence, and persistence). Character developed toward greater maturity,  although self-transcendence decreased with age. However, self-transcendence was  the strongest predictor of overall personality change. Cohort effects indicated  lower level of self-transcendence and higher level of self-directedness and  cooperativeness in younger birth cohorts. Regarding temperament, novelty seeking  decreased and persistence increased slightly with age. Both high novelty seeking  and high persistence predicted overall personality change.

Author information: (1)Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. t.white@erasmusmc.nl	There is emerging evidence for a connection between the surface morphology of  the brain and its underlying connectivity. The foundation for this relationship  is thought to be established during brain development through the shaping  influences of tension exerted by viscoelastic nerve fibers. The tension-based  morphogenesis results in compact wiring that enhances efficient neural  processing. Individuals with schizophrenia present with multiple symptoms that  can include impaired thought, action, perception, and cognition. The global  nature of these symptoms has led researchers to explore a more global disruption  of neuronal connectivity as a theory to explain the vast array of clinical and  cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. If cerebral function and form are linked  through the organization of neural connectivity, then a disruption in neural  connectivity may also alter the surface morphology of the brain. This paper  reviews developmental theories of gyrification and the potential interaction  between gyrification and neuronal connectivity. Studies of gyrification  abnormalities in children, adolescents, and adults with schizophrenia  demonstrate a relationship between disrupted function and altered morphology in  the surface patterns of the cerebral cortex. This altered form may provide  helpful clues in understanding the neurobiological abnormalities associated with  schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000842 PMID: 21262059 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Center of Alcohol Studies, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 607  Allison Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA. eymun@rci.rutgers.edu	Comment on     Dev Psychopathol. 2010 May;22(2):239-54.	Sterba and Bauer's Keynote Article discusses the blurred distinction between  theoretical principles and analytical methods in the person-oriented approach as  problematic and review which of the person-oriented principles are testable  under the four types of latent variable models for longitudinal data. Although  the issue is important, some arbitrariness exists in determining whether a given  principle can be tested within each analytic approach. To close the gap between  person-oriented theory and methods and to extend the person-oriented approach  more generally, it is necessary to embrace both variable-oriented and  person-oriented methods because it is not the individual analytic methods but  how studies are implemented as a whole that defines the person-oriented  approach. Three areas in developmental psychopathology are discussed in which  variable-oriented and person-oriented methods can be complementary. The need to  better understand the target system using an appropriate person-specific tool is  graphically illustrated. Several concepts of dynamic systems such as attractors,  phase transitions, and control parameters are illustrated using experimentally  perturbed cardiac rhythms (heart rate variability) as an example in the context  of translational alcohol research.

Language difficulties and internalizing problems: Bidirectional associations  from 18 months to 8 years among boys and girls.	Helland SS(1), Røysamb E(1), Wang MV(1), Gustavson K(1).	Author information: (1)Norwegian Institute of Public Health.	Studies have shown that early language difficulties are associated with later  internalizing problems. Less is known about the nature of the association: the  bidirectional relationship over time, the role of different types of language  difficulties, and gender differences. The present study examined bidirectional  longitudinal associations between parent-rated language difficulties and  internalizing problems in a four-wave cross-lagged model from 18 months to 8  years. Data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study were used (N =  114,000). Gender-specific dichotomized language variables were created, and  associations were investigated uniquely for boys and girls. Logistic regression  analyses showed that all cross-lagged associations from 18 months to 5 years  were significant for girls (odds ratios [ORs] = 1.48-1.94). For boys, only  internalizing problems at 3 years predicted change in language difficulties (OR  = 2.33). From 5 to 8 years, the cross-lagged associations between semantic  language difficulties and internalizing problems were significant and strong for  girls (ORs = 1.92-2.97) and nonsignificant for boys. The results suggest that  the associations between language difficulties and internalizing problems are  bidirectional from an early age, and that girls are especially vulnerable for  developing co-occurring language difficulties and internalizing problems during  the years of transition to school.

Endocrinological and subjective stress responses in children with depressive,  anxiety, or externalizing disorders.	Stadelmann S(1), Jaeger S(1), Matuschek T(1), Bae YJ(1), von Klitzing K(1),  Klein AM(1), Döhnert M(1).	Author information: (1)University of Leipzig.	In this study, we used a stress test to investigate endocrinological and  subjective stress responses of 8- to 14-year-old children with internalizing or  externalizing disorders and healthy controls. The sample (N = 170) consisted of  clinical and community children. Parents were given a diagnostic interview to  diagnose their children's psychiatric condition. We measured saliva cortisol and  subjectively experienced arousal in children before and after the Trier Social  Stress Test for Children. Children also rated their performance immediately  after the stress test, and 1 hr later they rated their positive and negative  thoughts about this stressful event. Children with internalizing or  externalizing disorders exhibited a blunted cortisol response compared to  healthy controls. Depressed children rated their test performance lower and  reported more negative thoughts after the test in comparison to healthy  controls, anxious children reported more arousal before and after the task, and  children with externalizing disorders reported more positive thoughts. In  regression analyses, cortisol and subjective stress responses were both  predictive of psychiatric disorders. The study extends previous work on the  relation between psychiatric disorders and children's stress responses to an  experimentally induced stress task by including a broad range of psychiatric  disorders and by integrating endocrinological and subjective stress responses.

Beliefs in social inclusion: Invariance in associations among hope,  dysfunctional attitudes, and social inclusion across adolescence and young  adulthood.	Berry C(1), Greenwood K(1).	Author information: (1)University of Sussex and Sussex Partnership National Health Service  Foundation Trust.	Social disability in youth is an important precursor of long-term social and  mental health problems. Social inclusion is a key policy driver and fits well  within a new paradigm of health and well-being rather than illness-oriented  services, yet little is known about social inclusion and its facilitators for  "healthy" young people. We present a novel exploratory structural analysis of  social inclusion using measures from 387 14- to 36-year-olds. Our model  represents social inclusion as comprising social activity and community  belonging, with both domains predicted by hopeful and dysfunctional self-beliefs  but hopefulness more uniquely predicting social inclusion in adolescence. We  conclude that social inclusion can be modeled for meaningful comparison across  spectra of development, mental health, and functioning.

Effects of a school readiness intervention on hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal  axis functioning and school adjustment for children in foster care.	Graham AM(1), Pears KC(2), Kim HK(2), Bruce J(2), Fisher PA(2).	Author information: (1)Oregon Health and Science University. (2)Oregon Social Learning Center.	Maltreated children in foster care are at high risk for dysregulated  hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning and educational  difficulties. The present study examined the effects of a short-term school  readiness intervention on HPA axis functioning in response to the start of  kindergarten, a critical transition marking entry to formal schooling, and  whether altered HPA axis functioning influenced children's school adjustment.  Compared to a foster care comparison group, children in the intervention group  showed a steeper diurnal cortisol slope on the first day of school, a pattern  previously observed among nonmaltreated children. A steeper first day of school  diurnal cortisol slope predicted teacher ratings of better school adjustment  (i.e., academic performance, appropriate classroom behaviors, and engagement in  learning) in the fall of kindergarten. Furthermore, the children's HPA axis  response to the start of school mediated the effect of the intervention on  school adjustment. These findings support the potential for ameliorative effects  of interventions targeting critical transitional periods, such as the transition  of formal schooling. This school readiness intervention appears to influence  stress neurobiology, which in turn facilitates positive engagement with the  school environment and better school adjustment in children who have experienced  significant early adversity.

History of child maltreatment and telomere length in immune cell subsets:  Associations with stress- and attachment-related hormones.	Boeck C(1), Krause S(2), Karabatsiakis A(1), Schury K(1), Gündel H(2), Waller  C(2), Kolassa IT(1).	Author information: (1)Ulm University. (2)University Hospital Ulm.	Experiencing maltreatment during childhood can have long-lasting consequences  for both mental and physical health. Immune cell telomere length (TL) shortening  might be one link between child maltreatment (CM) experiences and adverse health  outcomes later in life. While the stress hormone cortisol has been associated  with TL attrition, the attachment-related hormone oxytocin may promote  resilience. In 15 mothers with and 15 age- and body mass index-matched mothers  without CM, we assessed TL in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and selected  immune cell subsets (monocytes, naive, and memory cytotoxic T cells) by  quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization, as well as peripheral cortisol  and oxytocin levels. Memory cytotoxic T cells showed significantly shorter TL in  association with CM, whereas TL in monocytes and naive cytotoxic T cells did not  significantly differ between the two groups. Across both groups, cortisol was  negatively associated with TL, while oxytocin was positively associated with TL  in memory cytotoxic T cells. These results indicate that long-lived memory  cytotoxic T cells are most affected by the increased biological stress state  associated with CM. Keeping in mind the correlational and preliminary nature of  the results, the data suggest that cortisol may have a damaging and oxytocin a  protective function on TL.

Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), dopamine transporter solute carrier family C6,  member 4 (SLC6A3), and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes as moderators  of the relation between maternal history of maltreatment and infant emotion  regulation.

Although infants less than 18 months old are capable of engaging in  self-regulatory behavior (e.g., avoidance, withdrawal, and orienting to other  aspects of their environment), the use of self-regulatory strategies at this age  (as opposed to relying on caregivers) is associated with elevated behavioral and  physiological distress. This study investigated infant dopamine-related  genotypes (dopamine receptor D2 [DRD2], dopamine transporter solute carrier  family C6, member 4 [SLC6A3], and catechol-O-methyltransferase [COMT]) as they  interact with maternal self-reported history of maltreatment to predict observed  infant independent emotion regulation behavior. A community sample (N = 193) of  mother-infant dyads participated in a toy frustration challenge at infant age 15  months, and infant emotion regulation behavior was coded. Buccal cells were  collected for genotyping. Maternal maltreatment history significantly interacted  with infant SLC6A3 and COMT genotypes, such that infants with more 10-repeat and  valine alleles of SLC6A3 and COMT, respectively, relative to infants with fewer  or no 10-repeat and valine alleles, utilized more independent (i.e.,  maladaptive) regulatory behavior if mother reported a more extensive  maltreatment history, as opposed to less. The findings indicate that child  genetic factors moderate the intergenerational impact of maternal maltreatment  history. The results are discussed in terms of potential mechanism of Gene ×  Environment interaction.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417001122 PMID: 28803562 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Altered intrinsic functional connectivity of the cingulate cortex in children  with severe temper outbursts.	Roy AK(1), Bennett R(1), Posner J(2), Hulvershorn L(3), Castellanos FX(4), Klein  RG(4).	Author information: (1)Fordham University. (2)Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. (3)Indiana University School of Medicine. (4)New York University Langone School of Medicine.	Severe temper outbursts (STO) in children are associated with impaired school  and family functioning and may contribute to negative outcomes. These outbursts  can be conceptualized as excessive frustration responses reflecting reduced  emotion regulation capacity. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been  implicated in negative affect as well as emotional control, and exhibits  disrupted function in children with elevated irritability and outbursts. This  study examined the intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of a region of the  ACC, the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), in 5- to 9-year-old children with  STO (n = 20), comparing them to children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder (ADHD) without outbursts (ADHD; n = 18). Additional analyses compared  results to a sample of healthy children (HC; n = 18) and examined specific  associations with behavioral and emotional dysregulation. Compared to the ADHD  group, STO children exhibited reduced iFC between the aMCC and surrounding  regions of the ACC, and increased iFC between the aMCC and precuneus. These  differences were also seen between the STO and HC groups; ADHD and HC groups did  not differ. Specificity analyses found associations between aMCC-ACC  connectivity and hyperactivity, and between aMCC-precuneus iFC and emotion  dysregulation. Disruption in aMCC networks may underlie the behavioral and  emotional dysregulation characteristic of children with STO.

Mental health difficulties and academic attainment: Evidence for gender-specific  developmental cascades in middle childhood.	Panayiotou M(1), Humphrey N(1).	Author information: (1)University of Manchester.	We present a developmental cascade model of the longitudinal relationships  between internalizing symptoms, externalizing problems, and academic performance  in middle childhood, utilizing a large sample (N = 1,771) from the United  Kingdom in a 3-year, cross-lag design. Three hypotheses were tested: adjustment  erosion, academic incompetence, and (cumulative) shared risk. In addition, we  sought to examine whether developmental cascade pathways varied across gender,  while also statistically exploring indirect, mediation pathways. Structural  equation models that accounted for within-time covariance, data nesting, and  temporal stability provided evidence of gender-specific effects as follows:  externalizing-attainment adjustment erosion pathways were found only in boys,  while attainment-internalizing/externalizing academic incompetence pathways were  found only in girls. Analysis of mediation pathways provided further support for  these gender-specific longitudinal profiles. Protective longitudinal  internalizing-externalizing and externalizing-internalizing pathways were found  for both boys and girls. Finally, while it improved model fit for both genders,  the influence of cumulative shared risk on the aforementioned pathways was  relatively meager, substantively affecting only one (externalizing-attainment  adjustment erosion pathway in boys). The implications of these findings are  discussed, and study limitations noted.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941700102X PMID: 28712379 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Wolff JJ(1), Jacob S(1), Elison JT(1).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota.	By definition, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder  that emerges during early childhood. It is during this time that infants and  toddlers transition from appearing typical across multiple domains to exhibiting  the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Neuroimaging studies focused on this period of  development have provided crucial knowledge pertaining to this process,  including possible mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of the disorder and  offering the possibility of prodromal or presymptomatic prediction of risk. In  this paper, we review findings from structural and functional brain imaging  studies of ASD focused on the first years of life and discuss implications for  next steps in research and clinical applications.

In a large-scale (N = 317) prospective 8-year longitudinal multiage,  multidomain, multivariate, multisource study, we tested a conservative  three-term model linking parenting cognitions in toddlerhood to parenting  practices in preschool to classroom externalizing behavior in middle childhood,  controlling for earlier parenting practices and child externalizing behavior.  Mothers who were more knowledgeable, satisfied, and attributed successes in  their parenting to themselves when their toddlers were 20 months of age engaged  in increased supportive parenting during joint activity tasks 2 years later when  their children were 4 years of age, and 6 years after that their 10-year-olds  were rated by teachers as having fewer classroom externalizing behavior  problems. This developmental cascade of a "standard model" of parenting applied  equally to families with girls and boys, and the cascade from parenting  attributions to supportive parenting to child externalizing behavior obtained  independent of 12 child, parent, and family covariates. Conceptualizing  socialization in terms of cascades helps to identify points of effective  intervention.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417000931 PMCID: PMC5823787 PMID: 28625208 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Consistency matters: Consistency in the timing and quality of daily interactions  between parents and adolescents predicts production of proinflammatory cytokines  in youths.	Manczak EM(1), Leigh AKK(1), Chin CP(1), Chen E(1).	Author information: (1)Northwestern University.	The current study examined whether consistency in day-to-day interactions  between children and parents related to inflammatory cytokine production in  youths. One hundred twenty-three parents recorded the daily quality of  interactions and timing of leisure activities with their adolescent children for  2 weeks, and the degree of variability in those ratings was calculated. One year  later, the production of proinflammatory cytokines in youths' blood was measured  in response to in vitro exposure to lipopolysaccharide (a bacterial product).  The results indicate that greater variability in parent-child relationship  quality related to greater stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production in  youths, above and beyond overall relationship quality. Greater variability in  the timing of parent-child leisure activities also predicted greater stimulated  proinflammatory cytokine production in youths, regardless of the frequency of  interactions. In sum, consistency in both the affective and temporal aspects of  parent-child relationships may contribute to inflammatory processes in youth.

A genetic variant brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphism  interacts with hostile parenting to predict error-related brain activity and  thereby risk for internalizing disorders in children.	Meyer A(1), Hajcak G(1), Hayden E(1), Sheikh HI(1), Singh SM(1), Klein DN(1).	Author information: (1)Florida State University.	The error-related negativity (ERN) is a negative deflection in the event-related  potential occurring when individuals make mistakes, and is increased in children  with internalizing psychopathology. We recently found that harsh parenting  predicts a larger ERN in children, and recent work has suggested that variation  in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene may moderate the impact of  early life adversity. Parents and children completed measures of parenting when  children were 3 years old (N = 201); 3 years later, the ERN was measured and  diagnostic interviews as well as dimensional symptom measures were completed. We  found that harsh parenting predicted an increased ERN only among children with a  methionine allele of the BDNF genotype, and evidence of moderated mediation: the  ERN mediated the relationship between parenting and internalizing diagnoses and  dimensional symptoms only if children had a methionine allele. We tested this  model with externalizing disorders, and found that harsh parenting predicted  externalizing outcomes, but the ERN did not mediate this association. These  findings suggest that harsh parenting predicts both externalizing and  internalizing outcomes in children; however, this occurs through different  pathways that uniquely implicate error-related brain activity in the development  of internalizing disorders.

Early maturation and substance use across adolescence and young adulthood: A  longitudinal study of Finnish twins.

(3)University of Jyvaskyla. (4)University of Helsinki.	Early maturation, indexed by pubertal development (PD), has been associated with  earlier initiation and greater frequency of adolescent substance use, but this  relationship may be biased by confounding factors and effects that change across  development. Using a population-based Finnish twin sample (N = 3,632  individuals), we conducted twin modeling and multilevel structural equation  modeling of the relationship between PD and substance use at ages 12-22. Shared  environmental factors contributed to early PD and heavier substance use for  females. Biological father absence was associated with early PD for boys but not  girls, and did not account for the relationship between PD and substance use.  The association between early PD and heavier substance use was partially due to  between-family confounds, although early PD appeared to qualitatively alter  long-term trajectories for some substances (nicotine), but not others (alcohol).  Mediation by peer and parental factors did not explain this relationship within  families. However, higher peer substance use and lower parental monitoring were  themselves associated with heavier substance use, strengthening the existing  evidence for these factors as targets for prevention/intervention efforts. Early  maturation was not supported as a robust determinant of alcohol use trajectories  in adolescence and young adulthood, but may require longer term follow-up.  Subtle effects of early PD on nicotine and illicit drug use trajectories  throughout adolescence and adulthood merit further investigation.

Testing the primary versus secondary variants model in children.	Dadds MR(1), Kimonis ER(2), Schollar-Root O(1), Moul C(1), Hawes DJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Sydney. (2)University of New South Wales.	The role of environmental adversity in the development of high  callous-unemotional (CU) traits in children is controversial. Evidence speaks to  the traits being largely independent of adversity; however, recent data shows  that those with high CU traits and high adversity and/or high anxiety might  differ in important ways from those with no such history. We tested this using  emotion recognition (ER) skills. We tested whether maltreatment history and  anxiety levels moderated the relationship between level of CU traits and ER  skills in N = 364 children with behavioral problems who were 3 to 16 years old.  As hypothesised, in the full sample, the relationship between CU traits and ER  differed according to maltreatment history, such that CU traits were associated  with poorer recognition for those with zero or negligible history of  maltreatment. This moderation of the CU-ER relationship by maltreatment was  inconsistent across subgroups, however, and for the cohort utilizing youth  self-report of maltreatment, high CU traits were associated with poor ER in  those with lower anxiety levels. Maltreatment history and/or anxiety levels can  identify different emotional impairments associated with high CU traits, and the  impairments might be characteristic of "primary" high CU traits defined as  occurring independently of maltreatment and/or high anxiety.

Genetic and environmental influences on the codevelopment among borderline  personality disorder traits, major depression symptoms, and substance use  disorder symptoms from adolescence to young adulthood.

(3)University of Minnesota. (4)University of Michigan.	Although borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits decline from adolescence  to adulthood, comorbid psychopathology such as symptoms of major depressive  disorder (MDD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and drug use disorders (DUDs) likely  disrupt this normative decline. Using a longitudinal sample of female twins (N =  1,763), we examined if levels of BPD traits were correlated with changes in MDD,  AUD, and DUD symptoms from ages 14 to 24. A parallel process biometric latent  growth model examined the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to  the relationships between developmental components of these phenotypes. Higher  BPD trait levels predicted a greater rate of increase in AUD and DUD symptoms,  and higher AUD and DUD symptoms predicted a slower rate of decline of BPD traits  from ages 14 to 24. Common genetic influences accounted for the associations  between BPD traits and each disorder, as well as the interrelationships of AUD  and DUD symptoms. Both genetic and nonshared environmental influences accounted  for the correlated levels between BPD traits and MDD symptoms, but solely  environmental influences accounted for the correlated changes between the two  over time. Results indicate that higher levels of BPD traits may contribute to  an earlier onset and faster escalation of AUD and DUD symptoms, and substance  use problems slow the normative decline in BPD traits. Overall, our data  suggests that primarily genetic influences contribute to the comorbidity between  BPD features and substance use disorder symptoms. We discuss our data in the  context of two major theories of developmental psychopathology and comorbidity.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417000463 PMCID: PMC5662484 PMID: 28420454 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Vakrat A(1), Apter-Levy Y(1), Feldman R(1).	Author information: (1)Bar-Ilan University.	Maternal depression negatively impacts children's development, yet few studies  have focused on fathering and the family process in cases of maternal  depression. A community cohort of married/cohabitating women was recruited on  the second postbirth day (N = 1,983) and maternal depression repeatedly assessed  across the first year and again at 6 years to form two cohorts: mothers  chronically depressed from birth to 6 (N = 46) and nondepressed controls (N =  103). At 6 years, mother-child, father-child, and family interactions were  observed. In families of depressed mothers, both mother and father exhibited  lower sensitivity and higher intrusiveness, and children displayed lower social  engagement during interactions with mother and father. Fathering moderated the  effects of maternal depression on the family process. When fathers showed low  sensitivity, high intrusiveness, and provided little opportunities for child  social engagement, the family process was less cohesive, implying a decrease in  the family's harmonious, warm, and collaborative style. However, in cases of  high father sensitivity, low intrusiveness, and increased child engagement, the  family process was unaffected by maternal depression. Findings describe both  comparability and compensatory mechanisms in the effects of fathering on family  life when maternal care is deficient, highlight the buffering role of fathers,  and underscore the importance of father-focused interventions when mothers are  depressed.

Association of cognitive function and liability to addiction with childhood  herpesvirus infections: A prospective cohort study.

Liability to substance use disorder (SUD) is largely nonspecific to particular  drugs and is related to behavior dysregulation, including reduced cognitive  control. Recent data suggest that cognitive mechanisms may be influenced by  exposure to neurotropic infections, such as human herpesviruses. In this study,  serological evidence of exposure to human herpesvirus Herpes simplex virus Type  1 (HSV-1), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as well as  Toxoplasma gondii was determined in childhood (age ~11 years) in 395 sons and  174 daughters of fathers with or without SUD. Its relationships with a cognitive  characteristic (IQ) in childhood and with risk for SUD in adulthood were  examined using correlation, regression, survival, and path analyses. Exposure to  HSV-1, EBV, and T. gondii in males and females, and CMV in males, was associated  with lower IQ. Independent of that relationship, EBV in females and possibly in  males, and CMV and possibly HSV-1 in females were associated with elevated risk  for SUD. Therefore, childhood neurotropic infections may influence cognitive  development and risk for behavior disorders such as SUD. The results may point  to new avenues for alleviating cognitive impairment and SUD risk.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417000529 PMCID: PMC5648626 PMID: 28420448 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Mothering From the Inside Out: Results of a second randomized clinical trial  testing a mentalization-based intervention for mothers in addiction treatment.

This study was the second randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy  of Mothering From the Inside Out (MIO), a 12-week mentalization-based individual  therapy designed to address psychological deficits commonly associated with  chronic substance use that also interfere with the capacity to parent young  children. Eighty-seven mothers caring for a child between 11 and 60 months of  age were randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions of MIO versus 12 sessions of  parent education (PE), a psychoeducation active control comparison. Maternal  reflective functioning, representations of caregiving, mother-child interaction  quality, and child attachment were evaluated at baseline and posttreatment and  3-month follow-up. Mother-child interaction quality was assessed again at  12-month follow-up. In comparison with PE mothers, MIO mothers demonstrated a  higher capacity for reflective functioning and representational coherence at  posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, compared to PE  cohorts, MIO mothers demonstrated greater sensitivity, their children showed  greater involvement, and MIO dyads showed greater reciprocity. As addiction  severity increased, MIO also appeared to serve as a protective factor for  maternal reflective functioning, quality of mother-child interactions, and child  attachment status. Results demonstrate the promise of mentalization-based  interventions provided concomitant with addiction treatment for mothers and  their young children.

Lind T(1), Lee Raby K(2), Caron EB(1), Roben CK(1), Dozier M(1).	Author information: (1)University of Delaware. (2)University of Utah.	Young children in foster care often experience adversity, such as maltreatment  and lack of stability in early caregiving relationships. As a result, these  children are at risk for a range of problems, including deficits in executive  functioning. The Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up for Toddlers (ABC-T)  intervention was designed to help foster parents behave in ways that promote the  development of young children's emerging self-regulatory capabilities.  Participants included 173 parent-toddler dyads in three groups: foster families  that were randomly assigned to receive either the ABC-T intervention (n = 63) or  a control intervention (n = 58), as well as low-risk parent-toddler dyads from  intact families (n = 52). At a follow-up conducted when children were  approximately 48 months old, children's executive functioning abilities were  assessed with the attention problems scale of the Child Behavior Checklist  (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000) and a graded version of the Dimensional Change Card  Sort developed for preschoolers (Beck, Schaefer, Pang, & Carlson, 2011). Results  showed that foster children whose parents received the ABC-T intervention and  low-risk children never placed in foster care had fewer parent-reported  attention problems and demonstrated greater cognitive flexibility during the  Dimensional Change Card Sort than foster children whose parents received the  control intervention. These results indicate that an attachment-based  intervention implemented among toddlers in foster care is effective in enhancing  children's executive functioning capabilities.

Kobak R(1), Zajac K(2), Abbott C(1), Zisk A(1), Bounoua N(1).	Author information: (1)University of Delaware. (2)University of Connecticut School of Medicine.	The Goal-Corrected Partnership Adolescent Coding System (GPACS) has shown  promise in assessing a secure as well as three atypical patterns of  parent-adolescent interaction during a conflict discussion. The current study of  186 economically disadvantaged families examines the degree to which four GPACS  patterns: secure/collaborative, hostile/punitive, role confused, and  disoriented, prospectively predict adolescents' social competence and  maladaptive behavior (internalizing, externalizing, and risk behaviors) at age  15 years after controlling for these social behaviors at age 13 years and  contemporaneous GPACS scores. Adolescents from secure/collaborative dyads at age  13 were more likely to have a secure state of mind in the Adult Attachment  Interview at age 15 and showed higher levels of teachers' ratings of empathy and  lower levels of teachers' ratings of externalizing behaviors at age 15 years.  Adolescents in disoriented dyads showed higher levels of teacher-rated  internalizing problems, while male adolescents in role confused dyads reported  higher levels of involvement in risk behaviors, including unprotected sexual  activity and substance use problems.

The impact of life stress on adult depression and anxiety is dependent on gender  and timing of exposure.	Herbison CE(1), Allen K(1), Robinson M(1), Newnham J(1), Pennell C(1).	Author information: (1)University of Western Australia,Perth.	There is debate about the relative importance of timing of stressful events  prenatally and over the life course and risk for subsequent depressive/anxious  illness. The aim of this study was to examine the relative roles of prenatal  stress and postnatal stress trajectories in predicting depression and anxiety in  early adulthood in males and females. Exposure to life stress events was  examined in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study during  pregnancy and ages 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 14, and 17 years. At age 20, offspring  completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Prenatal stress and trajectories  of stress events from age 1 to 17 were analyzed in linear regression analyses.  Five postnatal stress trajectories were identified. In females, medium to high  chronic stress exposure or exposure during puberty/adolescence predicted  depression and anxiety symptoms while low or reduced stress exposure over the  life course did not, after adjustment for relevant confounders. High stress  early in pregnancy contributed to male depression/anxiety symptoms independent  of postnatal stress trajectory. In females, postnatal stress trajectory was more  important than prenatal stress in predicting depression/anxiety symptoms.  Interventions focused on reducing and managing stress events around  conception/pregnancy and exposure to chronic stress are likely to have  beneficial outcomes on rates of depression and anxiety in adults.

The mediating roles of cortisol reactivity and executive functioning  difficulties in the pathways between childhood histories of emotional insecurity  and adolescent school problems.	Martin MJ(1), Davies PT(2), Cummings EM(3), Cicchetti D(4).	Author information: (1)University of Nebraska-Lincoln. (2)University of Rochester. (3)University of Notre Dame. (4)University of Minnesota.	This study tested a hypothesized cascade in which children's insecure  representations of the interparental relationship increase their school problems  by altering children's cortisol reactivity to stress and their executive  functioning. Participants included 235 families. The first of five measurement  occasions occurred when the children were in kindergarten (M age = 6 years), and  they were followed through the transition to high school. The results indicated  that children's histories of insecure representations of the interparental  relationship during the early school years were associated with executive  functioning difficulties in adolescence (M age = 14 years). This in turn  predicted subsequent increases in school adjustment difficulties 1 year later.  In addition, elevated cortisol reactivity to interadult conflict mediated the  association between early histories of insecurity and subsequent executive  function problems in adolescence.

Maternal depression and trajectories of adolescent depression: The role of  stress responses in youth risk and resilience.	Monti JD(1), Rudolph KD(1).	Author information: (1)University of Illinois,Urbana-Champaign.	This study examined the independent and interactive contributions of maternal  depression and youth stress responses to trajectories of youth depression in  adolescence. Youths (n = 165, M age = 12.43, SD = 1.18) and their maternal  caregivers participated in a 4-year longitudinal study. Mothers and youths were  administered diagnostic interviews assessing depression, and youths provided  reports of their responses to peer stress. Consistent with an interactive model,  adaptive responses to stress (high effortful engagement and low involuntary  disengagement) buffered the effect of maternal depression on initial levels and  trajectories of youth depression, with gender differences emerging. Consistent  with a dual-risk model, maternal depression and maladaptive responses to stress  (high effortful disengagement and involuntary engagement) contributed additive  risks such that youths displayed the highest levels of depression when they were  exposed to maternal depression and showed maladaptive stress responses. This  research provides novel evidence that responses to stress contribute to  individual differences in depression among offspring of depressed mothers, and  suggests that responses to stress are an important target for efforts to promote  resilience in at-risk youth.

The developmental trajectory of perceived stress mediates the relations between  distress tolerance and internalizing symptoms among youth.	Felton JW(1), Banducci AN(1), Shadur JM(1), Stadnik R(1), MacPherson L(1),  Lejuez CW(1).	Author information: (1)University of Maryland,College Park.	The current study examines the relation between distress tolerance, perceived  stress, and internalizing symptoms across adolescence. Participants included 331  youth, ages 10 to 14 at the first wave of the study, assessed annually over 5  years. A latent growth curve approach was used to test three research questions,  including whether perceived stress would increase across adolescence, whether  distress tolerance (as measured by a behavioral task) would predict changes in  perceived stress, and whether changes in perceived stress would mediate the  relation between distress tolerance and internalizing symptoms. Results suggest  that, consistent with previous findings, rates of perceived stress do increase  across adolescence. Further, findings indicate that distress intolerance at  baseline predicted increases in perceived stress, which in turn drove increases  in internalizing symptoms. These findings point to the critical role of distress  tolerance in bringing about changes in depression and anxiety symptoms and  suggest support for utilizing a negative reinforcement framework to understand  the emergence of internalizing symptomology.

Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2017 Oct;29(4):1515.	Research on developmental trajectories of early maladaptive features for  understanding later personality disorders (PDs) is increasingly recognized as an  important study area. The course of early odd features is highly relevant in  this regard, as only a few researchers have addressed childhood oddity in the  context of emerging PDs. Using latent growth modeling, the current study  explores growth parameters of odd features in a mixed sample of Flemish  community and referred children (N = 485) across three measurement waves with  1-year time intervals. Personality pathology was assessed at a fourth assessment  point in adolescence. Beyond a general declining trend in oddity  characteristics, the results demonstrated that both an early onset and an  increasing trend of oddity-related characteristics over time are independent  predictors of adolescent PDs. Childhood oddity tends to be the most manifest  precursor for PDs with a core oddity feature (i.e., the schizotypal and  borderline PD), but also appears to predict most of the other DSM-5 PDs. Results  are discussed from an overarching developmental framework on PDs (Cicchetti,  2014), specifically focusing on the principle of multifinality. From a clinical  perspective, the significance of increasing or steady-high childhood oddity  trajectories for adolescent PDs highlights the relevance of systematic screening  processes across time.

Infant stranger fear trajectories predict anxious behaviors and diurnal cortisol  rhythm during childhood.	Van Hulle CA(1), Moore MN(1), Lemery-Chalfant K(2), Goldsmith HH(1), Brooker  RJ(3).	Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin-Madison. (2)Arizona State University. (3)Montana State University.	Although a robust literature has linked stable, high levels of fear across  childhood to increased risk for anxiety problems, less is known about  alternative pathways to anxiety. We tested two putatively normative  developmental pathways of early fearfulness for their distinct associations with  behavioral (anxiety-related behaviors and symptoms) and biological (diurnal  cortisol) markers of anxiety risk in middle childhood in a community-based  sample (n = 107). Steeper increases in fear from 6 to 36 months predicted more  parent-reported anxiety symptoms at age 8 years. In addition, children who  exhibited steep increases in fear during infancy were overrepresented among  children with diagnoses of separation anxiety disorder at age 8 years. Finally,  we showed that steeper increases in fearfulness in infancy predicted flatter  slopes of diurnal cortisol at age 8 years for girls. Thus, differences in  stranger fear across infancy may indicate varying degrees of risk for anxious  behaviors in later childhood.

Trajectories of child externalizing problems between ages 3 and 10 years:  Contributions of children's early effortful control, theory of mind, and  parenting experiences.	Olson SL(1), Choe DE(2), Sameroff AJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Michigan. (2)University of California,Davis.	Preventing problem behavior requires an understanding of earlier factors that  are amenable to intervention. The main goals of our prospective longitudinal  study were to trace trajectories of child externalizing behavior between ages 3  and 10 years, and to identify patterns of developmentally significant child and  parenting risk factors that differentiated pathways of problem behavior.  Participants were 218 3-year-old boys and girls who were reassessed following  the transition to kindergarten (age 5-6 years) and during the late school-age  years (age 10). Mothers contributed ratings of children's externalizing behavior  at all three time points. Children's self-regulation abilities and theory of  mind were assessed during a laboratory visit, and parenting risk (frequent  corporal punishment and low maternal warmth) was assessed using interview-based  and questionnaire measures. Four developmental trajectories of externalizing  behavior yielded the best balance of parsimony and fit with our longitudinal  data and latent class growth analysis. Most young children followed a pathway  marked by relatively low levels of symptoms that continued to decrease across  the school-age years. Atypical trajectories marked chronically high, increasing,  and decreasing levels of externalizing problems across early and middle  childhood. Three-year-old children with low levels of effortful control were far  more likely to show the chronic pattern of elevated externalizing problems than  changing or low patterns. Early parental corporal punishment and maternal  warmth, respectively, differentiated preschoolers who showed increasing and  decreasing patterns of problem behavior compared to the majority of children.  The fact that children's poor effortful regulation skills predicted chronic  early onset problems reinforces the need for early childhood screening and  intervention services.

Del Giudice M(1).	Author information: (1)University of New Mexico.	Statistical tests of differential susceptibility have become standard in the  empirical literature, and are routinely used to adjudicate between alternative  developmental hypotheses. However, their performance and limitations have never  been systematically investigated. In this paper I employ Monte Carlo simulations  to explore the functioning of three commonly used tests proposed by Roisman et  al. (2012). Simulations showed that critical tests of differential  susceptibility require considerably larger samples than standard power  calculations would suggest. The results also showed that existing criteria for  differential susceptibility based on the proportion of interaction index (i.e.,  values between .40 and .60) are especially likely to produce false negatives and  highly sensitive to assumptions about interaction symmetry. As an initial  response to these problems, I propose a revised test based on a broader window  of proportion of interaction index values (between .20 and .80). Additional  simulations showed that the revised test outperforms existing tests of  differential susceptibility, considerably improving detection with little effect  on the rate of false positives. I conclude by noting the limitations of a purely  statistical approach to differential susceptibility, and discussing the  implications of the present results for the interpretation of published findings  and the design of future studies in this area.

The interaction between monoamine oxidase A and punitive discipline in the  development of antisocial behavior: Mediation by maladaptive social information  processing.	Galán CA(1), Choe DE(2), Forbes EE(1), Shaw DS(1).	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh. (2)University of California,Davis.	Previous studies demonstrate that boys' monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genotype  interacts with adverse rearing environments in early childhood, including  punitive discipline, to predict later antisocial behavior. Yet the mechanisms by  which MAOA and punitive parenting interact during childhood to amplify risk for  antisocial behavior are not well understood. In the present study, hostile  attributional bias and aggressive response generation during middle childhood,  salient aspects of maladaptive social information processing, were tested as  possible mediators of this relation in a sample of 187 low-income men followed  prospectively from infancy into early adulthood. Given racial-ethnic variation  in MAOA allele frequencies, analyses were conducted separately by race. In both  African American and Caucasian men, those with the low-activity MAOA allele who  experienced more punitive discipline at age 1.5 generated more aggressive  responses to perceived threat at age 10 relative to men with the high-activity  variant. In the African American subsample only, formal mediation analyses  indicated a marginally significant indirect effect of maternal punitiveness on  adult arrest records via aggressive response generation in middle childhood. The  findings suggest that maladaptive social information processing may be an  important mechanism underlying the association between MAOA × Parenting  interactions and antisocial behavior in early adulthood. The present study  extends previous work in the field by demonstrating that MAOA and harsh  parenting assessed in early childhood interact to not only predict antisocial  behavior in early adulthood, but also predict social information processing, a  well-established social-cognitive correlate of antisocial behavior.

Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2017 Oct;29(4):1513-1514.	Longitudinal bidirectional effects between parents and children are usually  studied in samples of typically developing children, but remain understudied in  families with a child with autism spectrum disorder. This three-wave  longitudinal study examined how parents and children with autism spectrum  disorder influence one another, relying on parent reports of parenting behaviors  and children's problem behaviors across 9 years, in a sample of 139 youngsters  (M age Time 1 = 10.2 years, 83% boys). Cross-lagged analyses indicated that  children's externalizing problems at Time 1 predicted negative controlling  parenting 6 years later (Time 2) that in turn predicted externalizing problems 3  years later (Time 3). Negative parental control at Time 1 also increased the  risk for internalizing problems at Time 2. It was surprising that externalizing  problems at Time 2 also predicted positive parental involvement at Time 3. Thus,  although results indicate that externalizing problems generally elicit  maladaptive reactions in parents, this study also suggests that parents adjust  their way of reacting to externalizing child problems as their child reaches  adolescence/emerging adulthood. Implications for future research on parenting  dynamics in families with a child with autism spectrum disorder are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416001243 PMID: 28031057 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

(3)University of California,Riverside. (4)University of California,Davis. (5)University of Colorado. (6)Iowa State University.	We examined whether adolescents' genetic sensitivity, measured by a polygenic  index score, moderated the longitudinal associations between parenting and  adolescents' psychological adjustment. The sample included 323 mothers, fathers,  and adolescents (177 female, 146 male; Time 1 [T1] average age = 12.61 years, SD  = 0.54 years; Time 2 [T2] average age = 13.59 years, SD = 0.59 years). Parents'  warmth and hostility were rated by trained, independent observers using  videotapes of family discussions. Adolescents reported their symptoms of  anxiety, depressed mood, and hostility at T1 and T2. The results from  autoregressive linear regression models showed that adolescents' genetic  sensitivity moderated associations between observations of both mothers' and  fathers' T1 parenting and adolescents' T2 composite maladjustment, depression,  anxiety, and hostility. Compared to adolescents with low genetic sensitivity,  adolescents with high genetic sensitivity had worse adjustment outcomes when  parenting was low on warmth and high on hostility. When parenting was  characterized by high warmth and low hostility, adolescents with high genetic  sensitivity had better adjustment outcomes than their counterparts with low  genetic sensitivity. The results support the differential susceptibility model  and highlight the complex ways that genes and environment interact to influence  development.

Using a dot-probe task, we examined one possible source of  difference: allocation of attention to facial expressions of emotion. Thirteen  individuals with Williams syndrome (mean age = 19.2 years, range = 10-28.6), 20  with Down syndrome (mean age = 18.8 years, range = 12.1-26.3), and 19 typically  developing children participated. The groups were matched for mental age (mean =  5.8 years). None of the groups displayed a bias to angry faces. The participants  with Williams syndrome showed a selective bias toward happy faces, whereas the  participants with Down syndrome behaved similarly to the typically developing  participants with no such bias. Homogeneity in the direction of bias was  markedly highest in the Williams syndrome group whose bias appeared to result  from enhanced attention capture. They appeared to rapidly and selectively  allocate attention toward positive facial expressions. The complexity of social  approach behavior and the need to explore other aspects of cognition that may be  implicated in this behavior in both syndromes is discussed.

Breaking cycles of risk: The mitigating role of maternal working memory in  associations among socioeconomic status, early caregiving, and children's  working memory.	Suor JH(1), Sturge-Apple ML(1), Skibo MA(2).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester. (2)Westchester Community College.	Previous research has documented socioeconomic-related disparities in children's  working memory; however, the putative proximal caregiving mechanisms that  underlie these effects are less known. The present study sought to examine  whether the effects of early family socioeconomic status on children's working  memory were mediated through experiences of caregiving, specifically maternal  harsh discipline and responsiveness. Utilizing a psychobiological framework of  parenting, the present study also tested whether maternal working memory  moderated the initial paths between the family socioeconomic context and  maternal harsh discipline and responsiveness in the mediation model. The sample  included 185 socioeconomically diverse mother-child dyads assessed when children  were 3.5 and 5 years old. Results demonstrated that maternal harsh discipline  was a unique mediator of the relation between early experiences of family  socioeconomic adversity and lower working memory outcomes in children.  Individual differences in maternal working memory emerged as a potent individual  difference factor that specifically moderated the mediating influence of harsh  discipline within low socioeconomic contexts. The findings have implications for  early risk processes underlying deficits in child working memory outcomes and  potential targets for parent-child interventions.

An increasing number of researchers and policymakers have been moved to study  and intervene in the lives of children affected by violent conflicts (Masten,  2014). According to a United Nations Children's Fund (2009) report, over 1  billion children under the age of 18 are growing up in regions where acts of  political violence and armed conflict are, as Ladds and Cairns (1996, p. 15) put  it, "a common occurrence-a fact of life." In recent years, the United Nations  Children's Fund, advocacy and human rights groups, journalists, and researchers  have drawn public attention to the high rates of child casualties in these  regions, and to the plights of those children still caught in the crossfire. It  has thus become clear that both the challenges and the stakes are higher than  ever to promote the safety and well-being of affected children around the world  (Masten & Narayan, 2012; Tol, Jordans, Kohrt, Betancourt, & Komproe, 2012).

Childhood adversity and epigenetic regulation of glucocorticoid signaling genes:  Associations in children and adults.	Tyrka AR(1), Ridout KK(1), Parade SH(2).	Author information: (1)Butler Hospital. (2)Brown University Alpert Medical School.	Early childhood experiences have lasting effects on development, including the  risk for psychiatric disorders. Research examining the biologic underpinnings of  these associations has revealed the impact of childhood maltreatment on the  physiologic stress response and activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal  axis. A growing body of literature supports the hypothesis that environmental  exposures mediate their biological effects via epigenetic mechanisms.  Methylation, which is thought to be the most stable form of epigenetic change,  is a likely mechanism by which early life exposures have lasting effects. We  present recent evidence related to epigenetic regulation of genes involved in  hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation, namely, the glucocorticoid  receptor gene (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1 [NR3C1]) and  FK506 binding protein 51 gene (FKBP5), after childhood adversity and  associations with risk for psychiatric disorders. Implications for the  development of interventions and future research are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416000870 PMCID: PMC5330387 PMID: 27691985 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Grigorenko EL(1), Kornilov SA(1), Naumova OY(2).	Author information: (1)Baylor College of Medicine. (2)St. Petersburg State University.	The last decade has been marked by an increased interest in relating epigenetic  mechanisms to complex human behaviors, although this interest has not been  balanced, accentuating various types of affective and primarily ignoring  cognitive functioning. Recent animal model data support the view that epigenetic  processes play a role in learning and memory consolidation and help transmit  acquired memories even across generations. In this review, we provide an  overview of various types of epigenetic mechanisms in the brain (DNA  methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNA action) and discuss their  impact proximally on gene transcription, protein synthesis, and synaptic  plasticity and distally on learning, memory, and other cognitive functions. Of  particular importance are observations that neuronal activation regulates the  dynamics of the epigenome's functioning under precise timing, with subsequent  alterations in the gene expression profile. In turn, epigenetic regulation  impacts neuronal action, closing the circle and substantiating the signaling  pathways that underlie, at least partially, learning, memory, and other  cognitive processes.

An investigation of child maltreatment and epigenetic mechanisms of mental and  physical health risk.	Cicchetti D(1), Hetzel S(1), Rogosch FA(2), Handley ED(2), Toth SL(2).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development. (2)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	In the present investigation, differential methylation analyses of the whole  genome were conducted among a sample of 548 school-aged low-income children  (47.8% female, 67.7% Black, M age = 9.40 years), 54.4% of whom had a history of  child maltreatment. In the context of a summer research camp, DNA samples via  saliva were obtained. Using GenomeStudio, Methylation Module, and the Illumina  Custom Model, differential methylation analyses revealed a pattern of greater  methylation at low methylation sites (n = 197 sites) and medium methylation  sites (n = 730 sites) and less methylation at high methylation sites (n = 907  sites) among maltreated children. The mean difference in methylation between the  maltreated and nonmaltreated children was 6.2%. The relative risk of  maltreatment with known disease biomarkers was also investigated using GenoGo  MetaCore Software. A large number of network objects previously associated with  mental health, cancer, cardiovascular systems, and immune functioning were  identified evidencing differential methylation among maltreated and  nonmaltreated children. Site-specific analyses were also conducted for aldehyde  dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1),  and nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1 (NR3C1) genes, and the  results highlight the importance of considering gender and the developmental  timing of maltreatment. For ALDH2, the results indicated that maltreated girls  evidenced significantly lower methylation compared to nonmaltreated girls, and  maltreated boys evidenced significantly higher methylation compared to  nonmaltreated boys. Moreover, early onset-not recently maltreated boys evidenced  significantly higher methylation at ALDH2 compared to nonmaltreated boys.  Similarly, children with early onset-nonrecent maltreatment evidenced  significantly higher methylation compared to nonmaltreated children at ANKK1.  The site-specific results were not altered by controlling for genotypic  variation of respective genes. The findings demonstrate increased risk for  adverse physical and mental health outcomes associated with differences in  methylation in maltreated children and indicate differences among maltreated  children related to developmental timing of maltreatment and gender in genes  involved in mental health functioning.

Cicchetti D(1), Hetzel S(1), Rogosch FA(2), Handley ED(2), Toth SL(2).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development. (2)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	A genome-wide methylation study was conducted among a sample of 114 infants (M  age = 13.2 months, SD = 1.08) of low-income urban women with (n = 73) and  without (n = 41) major depressive disorder. The Illumina HumanMethylation450  BeadChip array with a GenomeStudio Methylation Module and Illumina Custom model  were used to conduct differential methylation analyses. Using the 5.0 × 10-7 p  value, 2,119 loci were found to be significantly different between infants of  depressed and nondepressed mothers. Infants of depressed mothers had greater  methylation at low methylation sites (0%-29%) compared to infants of  nondepressed mothers. At high levels of methylation (70%-100%), the infants of  depressed mothers were predominantly hypomethylated. The mean difference in  methylation between the infants of depressed and infants of nondepressed mothers  was 5.23%. Disease by biomarker analyses were also conducted using GeneGo  MetaCore Software. The results indicated significant cancer-related differences  in biomarker networks such as prostatic neoplasms, ovarian and breast neoplasms,  and colonic neoplasms. The results of a process networks analysis indicated  significant differences in process networks associated with neuronal development  and central nervous system functioning, as well as cardiac development between  infants of depressed and nondepressed mothers. These findings indicate that  early in development, infants of mothers with major depressive disorder evince  epigenetic differences relative to infants of well mothers that suggest risk for  later adverse health outcomes.

Contextual adversity, telomere erosion, pubertal development, and health: Two  models of accelerated aging, or one?	Belsky J(1), Shalev I(2).	Author information: (1)University of California,Davis. (2)Pennsylvania State University.	Two independent lines of inquiry suggest that growing up under conditions of  contextual adversity (e.g., poverty and household chaos) accelerates aging and  undermines long-term health. Whereas work addressing the developmental origins  of health and disease highlights accelerated-aging effects of contextual  adversity on telomere erosion, that informed by an evolutionary analysis of  reproductive strategies highlights such effects with regard to pubertal  development (in females). That both shorter telomeres early in life and earlier  age of menarche are associated with poor health later in life raises the  prospect, consistent with evolutionary life-history theory, that these two  bodies of theory and research are tapping into the same  evolutionary-developmental process whereby longer term health costs are traded  off for increased probability of reproducing before dying via a process of  accelerated aging. Here we make the case for such a claim, while highlighting  biological processes responsible for these effects, as well as unknowns in the  epigenetic equation that might instantiate these contextually regulated  developmental processes.

Author information: (1)University of Utah. (2)University of Groningen.	The adaptive calibration model (ACM) is a theory of developmental programing  focusing on calibration of stress response systems and associated life history  strategies to local environmental conditions. In this article, we tested some  key predictions of the ACM in a longitudinal study of Dutch adolescent males  (11-16 years old; N = 351). Measures of sympathetic, parasympathetic, and  adrenocortical activation, reactivity to, and recovery from social-evaluative  stress validated the four-pattern taxonomy of the ACM via latent profile  analysis, though with some deviations from expected patterns. The physiological  profiles generally showed predicted associations with antecedent measures of  familial and ecological conditions and life stress; as expected, high- and  low-responsivity patterns were found under both low-stress and high-stress  family conditions. The four patterns were also differentially associated with  aggressive/rule-breaking behavior and withdrawn/depressed behavior. This study  provides measured support for key predictions of the ACM and highlights  important empirical issues and methodological challenges for future research.

(3)University of Pittsburgh. (4)University of Oregon.	Maltreatment is associated with chronic depression, high negative  self-attributions, and lifetime psychopathology. Adolescence is a sensitive  period for the formation of self-concept. Identifying neurobiomarkers of  self-processing in depressed adolescents with and without maltreatment may parse  the effects of trauma and depression on self-development and chronic  psychopathology. Depressed adolescents (n = 86) maltreated due to omission (DO,  n = 13) or commission (DCM, n = 28) or without maltreatment (DC, n = 45), and  HCs (HC, n = 37) appraised positive and negative self-descriptors in the  scanner. DCM and DO showed hypoactivity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex  (dACC) while processing positive versus negative self-descriptors compared to DC  youth, who in turn showed reduced dACC recruitment versus HC. HC youth showed  the highest activation in the dACC and striatum during positive  self-descriptors; these regions showed a linear decline in activity across DC,  DO, and DCM. Low dACC activity to positive versus negative self-descriptors was  linked to inadequate coregulation of children's emotions by parents. Negative  self-cognitions prevalent in DCM and DO adolescents may be perpetuated by  activity in the dACC and striatum. Reduced activation of the dACC and striatum  for positive self-descriptors, coupled with enhanced activity for negative  self-descriptors, may heighten the risk for persistent depression.

Author information: (1)Utrecht University.	Variation in the quality of parental care has a tremendous impact on a child's  social-emotional development. Research investigating the predictors of this  variability in human caregiving behavior has mostly focused on learning  mechanisms. Evidence is currently accumulating for the complementary underlying  role of steroid hormones and neuropeptides. An overview is provided of the  hormones and neuropeptides relevant for human caregiving behavior. Then the  developmental factors are described that stimulate variability in sensitivity to  these hormones and neuropeptides, which may result in variability in the  behavioral repertoire of caregiving. The role of genetic variation in  neuropeptide and steroid receptors, the role of testosterone and oxytocin during  fetal development and parturition, and the impact of experienced caregiving in  childhood on functioning of the neuroendocrine stress and oxytocin system are  discussed. Besides providing a heuristic framework for further research on the  ontogenetic development of human caregiving, a neuroendocrine model is also  presented for the intergenerational transmission of caregiving practices.  Insight into the underlying biological mechanisms that bring about maladaptive  caregiving behavior, such as neglect and insensitive parenting, will hopefully  result in more efficient approaches to reduce the high prevalence of such  behavior and to minimize the impact on those affected.

Hope Family Center. (3)University of Alberta Centre for Research in Applied Measurement and  Evaluation. (4)University of Minnesota.	The FK506 binding protein 5 gene (FKBP5) has been associated with susceptibility  to pathogenic effects of childhood trauma including dissociative symptoms. This  study examines the impact of maltreatment on dissociative tendencies in  adolescence as moderated by the FKBP5 gene. Dissociative symptoms and variation  within FKBP5 were assessed in a high-risk, low socioeconomic status community  sample of 279 maltreated and 171 nonmaltreated adolescents. Following the  assignment of haplotypes across four single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3800373,  rs9296158, rs1360780, and rs9470080), individuals with one or more copies of the  CATT haplotype (N = 230) were grouped together and compared to individuals with  zero copies of this haplotype (N = 185). Analyses of covariance were conducted  to test hypotheses regarding the effects of developmental timing and the  chronicity of maltreatment and the CATT haplotype. We found a significant  interactive effect of timing/chronicity of maltreatment and the CATT haplotype  on dissociative symptoms. Among adolescents who had no copies of the CATT  haplotype, dissociative symptoms were higher for chronically maltreated  adolescents who had an infancy onset compared to those who were not maltreated  or whose maltreatment experience was either relatively less chronic or not  started in infancy. The groups did not differ significantly among subjects who  carry one or more copies of the CATT haplotype.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941600105X PMID: 27760575 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Macdonald AN(1), Goines KB(1), Novacek DM(1), Walker EF(1).	Author information: (1)Emory University.	Accumulating behavioral and genetic research suggests that most forms of  psychopathology share common genetic and neural vulnerabilities and are  manifestations of a relatively few core underlying processes. These findings  support the view that comorbidity mostly arises, not from true co-occurrence of  distinct disorders, but from the behavioral expression of shared vulnerability  processes across the life span. The purpose of this review is to examine the  role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the shared vulnerability mechanisms  underlying the clinical phenomena of comorbidity from a transdiagnostic and  ontogenic perspective. In adopting this perspective, we suggest complex  transactions between neurobiologically rooted vulnerabilities inherent in PFC  circuitry and environmental factors (e.g., parenting, peers, stress, and  substance use) across development converge on three key PFC-mediated processes:  executive functioning, emotion regulation, and reward processing. We propose  that individual differences and impairments in these PFC-mediated functions  provide intermediate mechanisms for transdiagnostic symptoms and underlie  behavioral tendencies that evoke and interact with environmental risk factors to  further potentiate vulnerability.

Transactional cascades among child internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and  fathers' and mothers' posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were  examined in a sample of families with a male parent who had been deployed to  recent military conflicts in the Middle East. The role of parents' positive  engagement and coercive interaction with their child, and family members'  emotion regulation were tested as processes linking cascades of parent and child  symptoms. A subsample of 183 families with deployed fathers and nondeployed  mothers and their 4- to 13-year-old children who participated in a randomized  control trial intervention (After Deployment: Adaptive Parenting Tools) were  assessed at baseline prior to intervention, and at 12 and 24 months after  baseline, using parent reports of their own and their child's symptoms. Parents'  observed behavior during interaction with their children was coded using a  multimethod approach at each assessment point. Reciprocal cascades among  fathers' and mothers' PTSD symptoms, and child internalizing and externalizing  symptoms, were observed. Fathers' and mothers' positive engagement during  parent-child interaction linked their PTSD symptoms and their child's  internalizing symptoms. Fathers' and mothers' coercive behavior toward their  child linked their PTSD symptoms and their child's externalizing symptoms. Each  family member's capacity for emotion regulation was associated with his or her  adjustment problems at baseline. Implications for intervention, and for research  using longitudinal models and a family-systems perspective of co-occurrence and  cascades of symptoms across family members are described.

Juster RP(1), Russell JJ(2), Almeida D(2), Picard M(1).	Author information: (1)Columbia University. (2)McGill University.	Stress-related pathophysiology drives comorbid trajectories that elude precise  prediction. Allostatic load algorithms that quantify biological "wear and tear"  represent a comprehensive approach to detect multisystemic disease processes of  the mind and body. However, the multiple morbidities directly or indirectly  related to stress physiology remain enigmatic. Our aim in this article is to  propose that biological comorbidities represent discrete pathophysiological  processes captured by measuring allostatic load. This has applications in  research and clinical settings to predict physical and psychiatric comorbidities  alike. The reader will be introduced to the concepts of allostasis, allostasic  states, allostatic load, and allostatic overload as they relate to  stress-related diseases and the proposed prediction of biological comorbidities  that extend rather to understanding psychopathologies. In our transdisciplinary  discussion, we will integrate perspectives related to (a) mitochondrial biology  as a key player in the allostatic load time course toward diseases that "get  under the skin and skull"; (b) epigenetics related to child maltreatment and  biological embedding that shapes stress perception throughout lifespan  development; and	(c) evolutionary drivers of distinct personality profiles and biobehavioral  patterns that are linked to dimensions of psychopathology.

Transdiagnostic factors and pathways to multifinality: The error-related  negativity predicts whether preschool irritability is associated with  internalizing versus externalizing symptoms at age 9.

There is increasing interest among developmental psychopathologists in broad  transdiagnostic factors that give rise to a wide array of clinical presentations  (multifinality), but little is known about how these processes lead to  particular psychopathological manifestations over the course of development. We  examined whether individual differences in the error-related negativity (ΔERN),  a neural indicator of error monitoring, predicts whether early persistent  irritability, a prototypical transdiagnostic construct, is associated with later  internalizing versus externalizing outcomes. When children were 3 years old,  mothers were interviewed about children's persistent irritability and completed  questionnaires about their children's psychopathology. Three years later, EEG  was recorded while children performed a go/no-go task to measure the ΔERN. When  children were approximately 9 years old, mothers again completed questionnaires  about their children's psychopathology. The results indicated that among  children who were persistently irritable at age 3, an enhanced or more negative  ΔERN at age 6 predicted the development of internalizing symptoms at age 9,  whereas a blunted or smaller ΔERN at age 6 predicted the development of  externalizing symptoms. Our results suggest that variation in error monitoring  predicts, and may even shape, the expression of persistent irritability and  differentiates developmental trajectories from preschool persistent irritability  to internalizing versus externalizing outcomes in middle to late childhood.

Lusby CM(1), Goodman SH(1), Yeung EW(2), Bell MA(3), Stowe ZN(1).	Author information: (1)Emory University. (2)Arizona State University. (3)Virginia Tech.	Associations between infants' frontal EEG asymmetry and temperamental negative  affectivity (NA) across infants' first year of life and the potential moderating  role of maternal prenatal depressive symptoms were examined prospectively in  infants (n = 242) of mothers at elevated risk for perinatal depression. In  predicting EEG, in the context of high prenatal depressive symptoms, infant NA  and frontal EEG asymmetry were negatively associated at 3 months of age and  positively associated by 12 months of age. By contrast, for low depression  mothers, infant NA and EEG were not significantly associated at any age.  Postnatal depressive symptoms did not add significantly to the models. Dose of  infants' exposure to maternal depression mattered: infants exposed either pre-  or postnatally shifted from a positive association at 3 months to a negative  association at 12 months; those exposed both pre- and postnatally shifted from a  negative association at 3 months to a positive association at 12 months.  Prenatal relative to postnatal exposure did not matter for patterns of  association between NA and EEG.

Strategic considerations in the search for transactional processes: Methods for  detecting and quantifying transactional signals in longitudinal data.	Roisman GI(1), Fraley RC(2), Haltigan JD(3), Cauffman E(4), Booth-Laforce C(5).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota. (2)University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. (3)University of Ottawa. (4)University of California,Irvine. (5)University of Washington.	Over the last four decades the transactional model has emerged as a central  fixture of modern developmental science. Despite this, we are aware of no  principled approach for determining (a) whether it is actually necessary to  invoke transactional mechanisms to explain observed patterns of stability in a  given domain of adaptive functioning and (b) the extent to which transactional  processes, once identified in aggregate, are accounted for by measured domains  with which an aspect of adaptive functioning is theoretically in transaction.  Leveraging the fact that transactional mechanisms produce excess stability in an  outcome domain above and beyond autoregressive processes, along with the basic  logic of mediational analysis, we introduce two novel indexes for studying  transactional processes strategically. We apply these metrics to data from the  NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development cohort on mother- and  teacher-reported externalizing problems and social competence along with  teacher-reported and objective assessments of academic skills acquired in Grades  1, 3, and 5. During this developmental period we find that (a) transactional  contributions to stability are strongest for teacher-reported outcomes, next  strongest for mother-reported outcomes, and relatively weak for objective  assessments of academic skills and (b) observed maternal sensitivity (but not  child-reported friendship quality) accounts for a modest proportion of the total  transactional effects operative in most of the domains of adaptive functioning  we studied. Discussion focuses on extending the logic of our approach to  additional waves of measurement.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416000316 PMID: 27427806 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Rauer AJ(1), Pettit GS(2), Samek DR(2), Lansford JE(3), Dodge KA(3), Bates  JE(4).	Author information: (1)University of Tennessee. (2)Auburn University. (3)Duke University. (4)Indiana University.	This study considers the developmental origins of alcohol use in young  adulthood. Despite substantial evidence linking committed romantic relationships  to less problematic alcohol use in adulthood, the uniformity of these protective  benefits across different romantic relationships is unclear. Further, the extent  to which the establishment and maintenance of these romantic relationships is  preceded by earlier adolescence alcohol use remains unknown. To address these  gaps in the literature, the current study utilized multitiple-dimensional,  multiple-informant data spanning 20 years on 585 individuals in the Child  Development Project. Findings from both variable- and person-centered analyses  support a progression of associations predicting adolescent alcohol use (ages  15-16), drinking, and romantic relationships in early adulthood (ages 18-25),  and then problematic young adult alcohol use (age 27). Although adolescent  alcohol use predicted greater romantic involvement and turnover in early  adulthood, romantic involvement, but not turnover, appeared to reduce the  likelihood of later problematic drinking. These findings remained robust even  after accounting for a wide array of selection and socialization factors.  Moreover, characteristics of the individuals (e.g., gender) and of their  romantic relationships (e.g., partner substance use problems and romantic  relationship satisfaction) did not moderate these findings. Findings underscore  the importance of using a developmental-relational perspective to consider the  antecedents and consequences of alcohol use early in the life span.

Transactional cascades of destructive interparental conflict, children's  emotional insecurity, and psychological problems across childhood and  adolescence.	Davies PT(1), Martin MJ(1), Coe JL(1), Cummings EM(2).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester. (2)University of Notre Dame.	This study examined the transactional interplay among dimensions of destructive  interparental conflict (i.e., hostility and dysphoria), children's emotional  insecurity, and their psychological problems from middle childhood and  adolescence. Participants were 232 families, with the first of five measurement  occasions occurring when children were in first grade (M age = 7 years).  Cross-lagged, autoregressive models were conducted with a multiple-method,  multiple-informant measurement approach to identify developmental cascades of  interparental and child cascades. Results indicated that emotional insecurity  was a particularly powerful mediator of prospective associations between  interparental conflict (i.e., dysphoria and hostility) and child adjustment  during adolescence rather than childhood. In reflecting bidirectionality in  relationships between interparental and child functioning, children's  psychological problems predicted increases in interparental dysphoria during  childhood and adolescence. Although emotional insecurity was not identified as a  proximal predictor of interparental difficulties, an indirect cascade was  identified whereby insecurity in early adolescence was associated with increases  in teen psychological problems, which in turn predicted greater interparental  dysphoria over time. Results are interpreted in the context of how they advance  transactional formulation of emotional security theory and its resulting  translational implications for clinical initiatives.

Wertz J(1), Nottingham K(1), Agnew-Blais J(1), Matthews T(1), Pariante CM(1),  Moffitt TE(1), Arseneault L(1).	Author information: (1)King's College London.	In the present study, we used separate measures of parental monitoring and  parental knowledge and compared their associations with youths' antisocial  behavior during preadolescence, between the ages of 10 and 12. Parental  monitoring and knowledge were reported by mothers, fathers, and youths taking  part in the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study that follows  1,116 families with twins. Information on youths' antisocial behavior was  obtained from mothers as well as teachers. We report two main findings. First,  longitudinal cross-lagged models revealed that greater parental monitoring did  not predict less antisocial behavior later, once family characteristics were  taken into account. Second, greater youth antisocial behavior predicted less  parental knowledge later. This effect of youths' behavior on parents' knowledge  was consistent across mothers', fathers', youths', and teachers' reports, and  robust to controls for family confounders. The association was partially  genetically mediated according to a Cholesky decomposition twin model; youths'  genetically influenced antisocial behavior led to a decrease in parents'  knowledge of youths' activities. These two findings question the assumption that  greater parental monitoring can reduce preadolescents' antisocial behavior. They  also indicate that parents' knowledge of their children's activities is  influenced by youths' behavior.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416000213 PMCID: PMC5477420 PMID: 27427796 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Prenatal maternal depression and a multilocus genetic profile of two  susceptibility genes implicated in the stress response were examined in an  interaction model predicting negative emotionality in the first 3 years. In 179  mother-infant dyads from the Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability, and  Neurodevelopment cohort, prenatal depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies  Depressions Scale) was assessed at 24 to 36 weeks. The multilocus genetic  profile score consisted of the number of susceptibility alleles from the  serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region gene (5-HTTLPR): no  long-rs25531(A) (LA: short/short, short/long-rs25531(G) [LG], or LG/LG] vs. any  LA) and the dopamine receptor D4 gene (six to eight repeats vs. two to five  repeats). Negative emotionality was extracted from the Infant Behaviour  Questionnaire-Revised at 3 and 6 months and the Early Child Behavior  Questionnaire at 18 and 36 months. Mixed and confirmatory regression analyses  indicated that prenatal depression and the multilocus genetic profile interacted  to predict negative emotionality from 3 to 36 months. The results were  characterized by a differential susceptibility model at 3 and 6 months and by a  diathesis-stress model at 36 months.

Methylation of the oxytocin receptor gene mediates the effect of adversity on  negative schemas and depression.	Simons RL(1), Lei MK(1), Beach SRH(1), Cutrona CE(2), Philibert RA(3).	Author information: (1)University of Georgia. (2)Iowa State University. (3)University of Iowa.	Building upon various lines of research, we posited that methylation of the  oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) would mediate the effect of adult adversity on  increased commitment to negative schemas and in turn the development of  depression. We tested our model using structural equation modeling and  longitudinal data from a sample of 100 middle-aged, African American women. The  results provided strong support for the model. Analysis of the 12 CpG sites  available for the promoter region of the OXTR gene identified four factors. One  of these factors was related to the study variables, whereas the others were  not. This factor mediated the effect of adult adversity on schemas relating to  pessimism and distrust, and these schemas, in turn, mediated the impact of OXTR  methylation on depression. All indirect effects were statistically significant,  and they remained significant after controlling for childhood trauma, age,  romantic relationship status, individual differences in cell types, and average  level of genome-wide methylation. These finding suggest that epigenetic  regulation of the oxytocin system may be a mechanism whereby the negative  cognitions central to depression become biologically embedded.

Childhood abuse and neglect (CAN) is considered as a risk factor for substance  use disorder (SUD). Based on the drinking to cope model, this study investigated  the association of two trauma-relevant emotions (shame and sadness) and  substance use. Using ecological momentary assessment we compared real-time  emotion regulation in situations with high and low intensity of shame and  sadness in currently abstinent patients with CAN and lifetime SUD (traumaSUD  group), healthy controls with CAN (traumaHC group), and without CAN (nontraumaHC  group). Multilevel analysis showed a positive linear relationship between high  intensity of both emotions and substance use for all groups. The traumaSUD group  showed heightened substance use in low, as well as in high, intensity of shame  and sadness. In addition, we found an interaction between type of emotion,  intensity, and group: the traumaHC group exhibited a fourfold increased risk for  substance use in high intense shame situations relative to the traumaSUD group.  Our findings provide evidence for the drinking to cope model. The traumaSUD  group showed a reduced distress tolerance for variable intensity of negative  emotions. The differential effect of intense shame for the traumaHC group  emphazises its potential role in the development of SUD following CAN. In  addition, shame can be considered a relevant focus for therapeutic  preinterventions and interventions for SUD after CAN.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416000432 PMID: 27292103 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Longitudinal study of premorbid adjustment in 22q11.2 deletion  (velocardiofacial) syndrome and association with psychosis.	Radoeva PD(1), Fremont W(1), Antshel KM(2), Kates WR(1).	Author information: (1)State University of New York at Upstate Medical University. (2)Syracuse University.	Velocardiofacial syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), is  associated with an increased risk of major psychiatric disorders, including  schizophrenia. The emergence of psychotic symptoms in individuals with  schizophrenia in the general population is often preceded by a premorbid period  of poor or worsening social and/or academic functioning. Our current study  evaluated premorbid adjustment (via the Cannon-Spoor Premorbid Adjustment Scale  [PAS]) and psychotic symptoms (via the Structured Interview for Prodromal  Symptoms and the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for  School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version) in youth with 22q11DS (N =  96), unaffected siblings (N = 40), and community controls (N = 50). The PAS  scores indicated greater maladjustment during all developmental periods in  individuals with 22q11DS compared to the controls. Many participants with  22q11DS had chronically poor (n = 33) or deteriorating (n = 6) PAS scores. In  22q11DS, chronically poor PAS trajectories and poor childhood and early  adolescence academic domain and total PAS scores significantly increased the  risk of prodromal symptoms or overt psychosis. Taking into account the  catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype, the best predictor of (prodromal)  psychosis was the early adolescence academic domain score, which yielded higher  sensitivity and specificity in the subgroup of youth with 22q11DS and the  high-activity (valine) allele. PAS scores may help identify individuals at  higher risk for psychosis.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416000018 PMID: 26864886 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Trajectories of childhood internalizing and externalizing psychopathology and  psychotic-like experiences in adolescence: A prospective population-based cohort  study.	Lancefield KS(1), Raudino A(2), Downs JM(1), Laurens KR(1).	Author information: (1)King's College London. (2)University of New South Wales.	Adolescent internalizing and externalizing psychopathology is strongly  associated with adult psychiatric morbidity, including psychotic disorders. This  study examined whether internalizing or externalizing trajectories  (continuity/discontinuity of symptoms) from middle childhood were associated  with adolescent psychotic-like experiences (PLEs). Prospective data were  collected from a community sample of 553 children (mean age = 10.4 years; 50%  male) and their primary caregivers. Participants completed questionnaire reports  of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology and PLEs at baseline, and  again approximately 2 years later. Logistic regression was used to examine the  association of adolescent PLEs with four trajectories of internalizing and  externalizing psychopathology (persistent, incident, remitting, and none),  controlling for a range of potential confounders and sampling bias. Significant  associations were identified between adolescent PLEs and the incident  internalizing (adjusted odds ratio [adj. OR] = 2.96; 95% confidence interval  [CI] = 1.60-5.49) and externalizing psychopathology (adj. OR = 2.14; 95% CI =  1.11-4.14) trajectories, as well as the persistent internalizing (adj. OR =  1.90; 95% CI = 1.13-3.18) and externalizing (adj. OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.02-3.19)  trajectories. Children with remitting psychopathology trajectories were no more  likely to present later PLEs than those who never experienced psychopathology.  While for many individuals symptoms and illness remit during development without  intervention, this study provides important insights regarding potential targets  and timing for delivery of early intervention and prevention programs.

Ruberry EJ(1), Lengua LJ(1), Crocker LH(1), Bruce J(2), Upshaw MB(1),  Sommerville JA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Washington. (2)Oregon Social Learning Center.	This study aimed to specify the neural mechanisms underlying the link between  low household income and diminished executive control in the preschool period.  Specifically, we examined whether individual differences in the neural processes  associated with executive attention and inhibitory control accounted for income  differences observed in performance on a neuropsychological battery of executive  control tasks. The study utilized a sample of preschool-aged children (N = 118)  whose families represented the full range of income, with 32% of families  at/near poverty, 32% lower income, and 36% middle to upper income. Children  completed a neuropsychological battery of executive control tasks and then  completed two computerized executive control tasks while EEG data were  collected. We predicted that differences in the event-related potential (ERP)  correlates of executive attention and inhibitory control would account for  income differences observed on the executive control battery. Income and ERP  measures were related to performance on the executive control battery. However,  income was unrelated to ERP measures. The findings suggest that income  differences observed in executive control during the preschool period might  relate to processes other than executive attention and inhibitory control.

Bountress K(1), Chassin L(2), Lemery-Chalfant K(2).	Author information: (1)Medical University of South Carolina. (2)Arizona State University.	The present study utilizes longitudinal data from a high-risk community sample  to examine the unique effects of genetic risk, parental knowledge about the  daily activities of adolescents, and peer substance use on emerging adult  substance use disorders (SUDs). These effects are examined over and above a  polygenic risk score. In addition, this polygenic risk score is used to examine  gene-environment correlation and interaction. The results show that during older  adolescence, higher adolescent genetic risk for SUDs predicts less parental  knowledge, but this relation is nonsignificant in younger adolescence. Parental  knowledge (using mother report) mediates the effects of parental alcohol use  disorder (AUD) and adolescent genetic risk on risk for SUD, and peer substance  use mediates the effect of parent AUD on offspring SUD. Finally, there are  significant gene-environment interactions such that, for those at the highest  levels of genetic risk, less parental knowledge and more peer substance use  confers greater risk for SUDs. However, for those at medium and low genetic  risk, these effects are attenuated. These findings suggest that the evocative  effects of adolescent genetic risk on parenting increase with age across  adolescence. They also suggest that some of the most important environmental  risk factors for SUDs exert effects that vary across level of genetic  propensity.

Child maltreatment, impulsivity, and antisocial behavior in African American  children: Moderation effects from a cumulative dopaminergic gene index.	Thibodeau EL(1), Cicchetti D(1), Rogosch FA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development.	A model examining the effects of an increasing number of maltreatment subtypes  experienced on antisocial behavior, as mediated by impulsivity and moderated by  a polygenic index of dopaminergic genotypes, was investigated. An African  American sample of children (N = 1,012, M age = 10.07) with and without  maltreatment histories participated. Indicators of aggression, delinquency, and  disruptive peer behavior were obtained from peer- and counselor-rated measures  to form a latent variable of antisocial behavior; impulsivity was assessed by  counselor report. Five genotypes in four dopaminergic genes (dopamine receptors  D4, D2, known as DRD4, DRD2; dopamine active transporter 1, known as DAT1; and  catechol-O-methyltransferase, known as COMT) conferring heightened environmental  sensitivity were combined into one polygenic index. Using structural equation  modeling, a first-stage, moderated-mediation model was evaluated. Age and sex  were entered as covariates, both as main effects and in interaction with  maltreatment and the gene index. The model had excellent fit: χ2 (32, N = 1,012)  = 86.51, p < .001; comparative fit index = 0.982, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.977,  root mean square error of approximation = 0.041, and standardized root mean  square residual = 0.022. The effect of maltreatment subtypes on antisocial  behavior was partially mediated by impulsivity (β = 0.173, p < .001), and these  relations were moderated by the number of differentiating dopaminergic  genotypes. Specifically, a significant Gene × Environment interaction (β =  0.016, p = .013) indicated that the relation between maltreatment and  impulsivity was stronger as children evinced more differentiating genotypes,  thereby strengthening the mediational effect of impulsivity on antisocial  behavior. These findings elucidate the manner by which maltreated children  develop early signs of antisocial behavior, and the genetic mechanisms involved  in greater vulnerability for maladaptation in impulse control within the context  of child maltreatment.

Harsh parent-child conflict is associated with decreased anti-inflammatory gene  expression and increased symptom severity in children with asthma.	Ehrlich KB(1), Miller GE(1), Chen E(1).	Author information: (1)Northwestern University.	Asthma is a chronic respiratory disorder that affects over 7 million children in  the United States. Evidence indicates that family stressors are associated with  worsening of asthma symptoms, and some research suggests that these stressful  experiences engender changes in children's immune systems in ways that  exacerbate airway inflammation and contribute to both acute and chronic asthma  symptoms. We examined the association between observed experiences of  parent-child conflict and the expression of signaling molecules involved in the  transduction of anti-inflammatory signals that regulate airway inflammation and  obstruction. Fifty-seven children and their parents participated in a conflict  task, and coders rated interactions for evidence of harsh and supportive  behaviors. Children reported on their perceptions of parental support and  reported on their daily asthma symptoms for 2 weeks. We collected peripheral  blood in children to measure leukocyte expression of messenger RNA for the  glucocorticoid receptor and the β2-adrenergic receptor. Analyses revealed that  harsh conflict behaviors were associated with decreased expression of both  messenger RNAs and more severe asthma symptoms. Neither supportive behaviors nor  perceived parental support was associated with gene expression or asthma  symptoms. These findings suggest that harsh interactions with parents are  associated with downregulation of key anti-inflammatory signaling molecules and  difficulties breathing in children with asthma. Children with asthma who are  also victims of maltreatment may be particularly susceptible to transcriptional  changes in immune cells that could worsen asthma over time.

Maternal elaborative reminiscing mediates the effect of child maltreatment on  behavioral and physiological functioning.	Valentino K(1), Hibel LC(2), Cummings EM(1), Nuttall AK(1), Comas M(1),  McDonnell CG(1).	Author information: (1)University of Notre Dame. (2)University of California,Davis.	Theoretical and empirical evidence suggest that the way in which parents discuss  everyday emotional experiences with their young children (i.e., elaborative  reminiscing) has significant implications for child cognitive and socioemotional  functioning, and that maltreating parents have a particularly difficult time in  engaging in this type of dialogue. This dyadic interactional exchange,  therefore, has the potential to be an important process variable linking child  maltreatment to developmental outcomes at multiple levels of analysis. The  current investigation evaluated the role of maternal elaborative reminiscing in  associations between maltreatment and child cognitive, emotional, and  physiological functioning. Participants included 43 maltreated and 49  nonmaltreated children (aged 3-6) and their mothers. Dyads participated in a  joint reminiscing task about four past emotional events, and children  participated in assessments of receptive language and emotion knowledge. Child  salivary cortisol was also collected from children three times a day (waking,  midday, and bedtime) on 2 consecutive days to assess daily levels and diurnal  decline. Results indicated that maltreating mothers engaged in significantly  less elaborative reminiscing than did nonmaltreating mothers. Maternal  elaborative reminiscing mediated associations between child maltreatment and  child receptive language and child emotion knowledge. In addition, there was  support for an indirect pathway between child maltreatment and child cortisol  diurnal decline through maternal elaborative reminiscing. Directions for future  research are discussed, and potential clinical implications are addressed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415000917 PMCID: PMC4818968 PMID: 26535941 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Developmental pathways from child maltreatment to adolescent marijuana  dependence: Examining moderation by FK506 binding protein 5 gene (FKBP5).	Handley ED(1), Rogosch FA(1), Cicchetti D(1).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	The current study examined the prospective association between child  maltreatment and the development of substance use disorder in adolescence with  the aim of investigating pathways underlying this relation, as well as genetic  moderation of these developmental mechanisms. Specifically, we tested whether  youth who experienced maltreatment prior to age 8 were at risk for the  development of marijuana dependence in adolescence by way of a childhood  externalizing pathway and a childhood internalizing pathway. Moreover, we tested  whether variation in FK506 binding protein 5 gene (FKBP5) CATT haplotype  moderated these pathways. The participants were 326 children (n =179 maltreated;  n = 147 nonmaltreated) assessed across two waves of data collection (childhood:  ages 7-9 and adolescence: ages 15-18). Results indicated that higher levels of  child externalizing symptoms significantly mediated the effect of child  maltreatment on adolescent marijuana dependence symptoms for individuals with  one or two copies of the FKBP5 CATT haplotype only. We did not find support for  an internalizing pathway from child maltreatment to adolescent marijuana  dependence, nor did we find evidence of moderation of the internalizing pathway  by FKBP5 haplotype variation. Findings extend previous research by demonstrating  that whether a maltreated child will traverse an externalizing pathway toward  substance use disorder in adolescence is dependent on FKBP5 genetic variation.

Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University. (2)University of Southern California.	Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2016 Nov;28(4pt2):1563-1564.	Throughout the life span, exposure to chronic stress such as child maltreatment  is thought to contribute to future dysfunction of the stress response system  (SRS) through the process of adaptive calibration. Dysfunction of the SRS is  associated with numerous health and behavior problems, so it is important to  understand under what conditions and what time frame adaptive calibration  occurs. The present study tested for adaptive calibration of the SRS in a sample  of maltreated (n = 303) and nonmaltreated (n = 151) youth during the important  developmental period of adolescence. Data were used from Waves 2, 3, and 4 of a  larger study of the consequences of maltreatment on health and well-being. At  each time point, participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test for  Children and provided a baseline and four poststressor saliva samples to measure  cortisol reactivity. Adaptive calibration was tested by performing a latent  profile analysis using the five samples of salivary cortisol provided at each  time point, and testing whether maltreatment status predicted the likelihood of  profile membership at Time 2, Time 3, and Time 4. Three cortisol profiles  emerged from the data at each time point (blunted, moderate, and elevated), and  results indicated that maltreated youth were more likely than nonmaltreated  youth to present with the blunted cortisol profile compared to the moderate and  elevated profiles at Time 2 and Time 3, even after controlling for recent  exposure to violence and trauma. At Time 4, there was no longer a difference in  profile membership between maltreated and nonmaltreated youth, suggesting  adaptive calibration may be a lengthy process requiring a period of years to  become evident. Overall, the findings provide support for adaptive calibration  and offer insight into the conditions under which adaptive calibration occurs.

Author information: (1)King's College London. (2)Duke University.	This paper presents multilevel findings on adolescents' victimization exposure  from a large longitudinal cohort of twins. Data were obtained from the  Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, an epidemiological study of  2,232 children (1,116 twin pairs) followed to 18 years of age (with 93%  retention). To assess adolescent victimization, we combined best practices in  survey research on victimization with optimal approaches to measuring life  stress and traumatic experiences, and introduce a reliable system for coding  severity of victimization. One in three children experienced at least one type  of severe victimization during adolescence (crime victimization, peer/sibling  victimization, Internet/mobile phone victimization, sexual victimization, family  violence, maltreatment, or neglect), and most types of victimization were more  prevalent among children from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Exposure to  multiple victimization types was common, as was revictimization; over half of  those physically maltreated in childhood were also exposed to severe physical  violence in adolescence. Biometric twin analyses revealed that environmental  factors had the greatest influence on most types of victimization, while severe  physical maltreatment from caregivers during adolescence was predominantly  influenced by heritable factors. The findings from this study showcase how  distinct levels of victimization measurement can be harmonized in large-scale  studies of health and development.

Genetic covariance between psychopathic traits and anticipatory skin conductance  responses to threat: Evidence for a potential endophenotype.

(3)University of Minnesota. (4)University of Pennsylvania.	The genetic architecture of the association between psychopathic traits and  reduced skin conductance responses (SCRs) is poorly understood. By using 752  twins aged 9-10 years, this study investigated the heritability of two SCR  measures (anticipatory SCRs to impending aversive stimuli and unconditioned SCRs  to the aversive stimuli themselves) in a countdown task. The study also  investigated the genetic and environmental sources of the covariance between  these SCR measures and two psychopathic personality traits:  impulsive/disinhibited (reflecting impulsive-antisocial tendencies) and  manipulative/deceitful (reflecting the affective-interpersonal features). For  anticipatory SCRs, 27%, 14%, and 59% of the variation was due to genetic, shared  environmental, and nonshared environmental effects, respectively, while the  percentages for unconditioned SCRs were 44%, 2%, and 54%. The  manipulative/deceitful (not impulsive/disinhibited) traits were negatively  associated with both anticipatory SCRs (r = -.14, p < .05) and unconditioned  SCRs (r = -.17, p < .05) in males only, with the former association  significantly accounted for by genetic influences (r g = -.72). Reduced  anticipatory SCRs represent a candidate endophenotype for the  affective-interpersonal facets of psychopathic traits in males.

Infant negative reactivity defines the effects of parent-child synchrony on  physiological and behavioral regulation of social stress.	Pratt M(1), Singer M(1), Kanat-Maymon Y(2), Feldman R(1).	Author information: (1)Bar-Ilan University. (2)Interdisciplinarty Center,Herzilia,Israel.	How infants shape their own development has puzzled developmentalists for  decades. Recent models suggest that infant dispositions, particularly negative  reactivity and regulation, affect outcome by determining the extent of parental  effects. Here, we used a microanalytic experimental approach and proposed that  infants with varying levels of negative reactivity will be differentially  impacted by parent-infant synchrony in predicting physiological and behavioral  regulation of increasing social stress during an experimental paradigm. One  hundred and twenty-two mother-infant dyads (4-6 months) were observed in the  face-to-face still face (SF) paradigm and randomly assigned to three  experimental conditions: SF with touch, standard SF, and SF with arms'  restraint. Mother-infant synchrony and infant negative reactivity were observed  at baseline, and three mechanisms of behavior regulation were microcoded;  distress, disengagement, and social regulation. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia  baseline, reactivity, and recovery were quantified. Structural equation modeling  provided support for our hypothesis. For physiological regulation, infants high  in negative reactivity receiving high mother-infant synchrony showed greater  vagal withdrawal, which in turn predicted comparable levels of vagal recovery to  that of nonreactive infants. In behavioral regulation, only infants low in  negative reactivity who received high synchrony were able to regulate stress by  employing social engagement cues during the SF phase. Distress was reduced only  among calm infants to highly synchronous mothers, and disengagement was lowest  among highly reactive infants experiencing high mother-infant synchrony.  Findings chart two pathways by which synchrony may bolster regulation in infants  of high and low reactivity. Among low reactive infants, synchrony builds a  social repertoire for handling interpersonal stress, whereas in highly reactive  infants, it constructs a platform for repeated reparation of momentary  interactive "failures" and reduces the natural tendency of stressed infants to  disengage from source of distress. Implications for the construction of  synchrony-focused interventions targeting infants of varying dispositions are  discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415000760 PMID: 26439070 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Disorganized attachment is an important early risk factor for socioemotional  problems throughout childhood and into adulthood. Prevailing models of the  etiology of disorganized attachment emphasize the role of highly dysfunctional  parenting, to the exclusion of complex models examining the interplay of child  and parental factors. Decades of research have established that extreme child  birth weight may have long-term effects on developmental processes. These  effects are typically negative, but this is not always the case. Recent studies  have also identified the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) as a moderator of  childrearing effects on the development of disorganized attachment. However,  there are inconsistent findings concerning which variant of the polymorphism  (seven-repeat long-form allele or non-seven-repeat short-form allele) is most  likely to interact with caregiving in predicting disorganized versus organized  attachment. In this study, we examined possible two- and three-way interactions  and child DRD4 polymorphisms and birth weight and maternal caregiving at age 6  months in longitudinally predicting attachment disorganization at 36 months. Our  sample is from the Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment  project, a sample of 650 mother-child dyads. Birth weight was cross-referenced  with normative data to calculate birth weight percentile. Infant DRD4 was  obtained with buccal swabs and categorized according to the presence of the  putative allele seven repeat. Macroanalytic and microanalytic measures of  maternal behavior were extracted from a videotaped session of 20 min of  nonfeeding interaction followed by a 10-min divided attention maternal task at 6  months. Attachment was assessed at 36 months using the Strange Situation  procedure, and categorized into disorganized attachment and others. The results  indicated that a main effect for DRD4 and a two-way interaction of birth weight  and 6-month maternal attention (frequency of maternal looking away behavior) and  sensitivity predicted disorganized attachment in robust logistic regression  models adjusted for social demographic covariates. Specifically, children in the  midrange of birth weight were more likely to develop a disorganized attachment  when exposed to less attentive maternal care. However, the association reversed  with extreme birth weight (low and high). The DRD4 seven-repeat allele was  associated with less disorganized attachment (protective), while  non-seven-repeat children were more likely to be classified as disorganized  attachment. The implications for understanding inconsistencies in the literature  about which DRD4 genotype is the risk direction are also considered. Suggestions  for intervention with families with infants at different levels of biological  risk and caregiving risk are also discussed.

Individuals with the short variant of the serotonin transporter linked  polymorphic region gene are more susceptible than individuals homozygous for the  long allele to the effects of stressful life events on risk for internalizing  and externalizing problems. We tested whether individual differences in coping  style explained this increased risk for problem behavior among youth who were at  both genetic and environmental risk. Participants included 279 children, ages  8-11, from the Children's Experiences and Development Study. Caregivers and  teachers reported on children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and  caregivers and children on children's exposure to harsh parenting and parental  warmth in middle childhood, and traumatic events. Children reported how  frequently they used various coping strategies. Results revealed that  short/short homozygotes had higher levels of internalizing problems compared  with long allele carriers and that short allele carriers had higher levels of  externalizing problems compared with long/long homozygotes under conditions of  high cumulative risk. Moreover, among children who were homozygous for the short  allele, those who had more cumulative risk indicators less frequently used  distraction coping strategies, which partly explained why they had higher levels  of internalizing problems. Coping strategies did not significantly mediate Gene  × Environment effects on externalizing symptoms.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415000723 PMID: 26439066 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Temple University. (2)University of California,Davis.	Evocative effects of child characteristics on the quality and quantity of child  care were assessed in two studies using longitudinal data from the NICHD Study  of Early Child Care. We focus on the influence of child characteristics on two  important aspects of the child care experience: language stimulation provided by  caregivers and quantity of care. In Study 1, associations between the  developmental status of children aged 15 to 54 months and the language  stimulation provided by their caregivers were examined using path models, and  longitudinal child effects were detected across the earliest time points of the  study. In Study 2, the associations among child behavior, temperament,  development, and time in care were examined. Little evidence was found for such  child effects on time in care. The results are discussed in terms of the effects  of child care on child development and implications for developmental processes,  particularly for children at greatest risk for developmental delay or  psychopathology.

Mutual influences between child emotion regulation and parent-child reciprocity  support development across the first 10 years of life: Implications for  developmental psychopathology.	Feldman R(1).	Author information: (1)Bar-Ilan University.	Elucidating the mechanisms by which infant birth conditions shape development  across lengthy periods is critical for understanding typical and pathological  development and for targeted early interventions. This study examined how  newborns' regulatory capacities impact 10-year outcomes via the bidirectional  influences of child emotion regulation (ER) and reciprocal parenting across  early development. Guided by dynamic systems theory, 125 infants were tested at  seven time points: birth, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months and 5 and 10 years. Initial  regulatory conditions were measured by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; vagal  tone) and neurobehavioral regulation (Brazelton, 1973) at birth. At each  assessment between 3 months and 5 years, infant ER was microcoded from  age-appropriate paradigms and mother-child reciprocity observed during social  interactions. Four regulation-related outcomes were measured at 10 years: child  RSA, empathy measured by mother-child conflict discussion and a lab paradigm,  accident proneness, and behavior problems. An autoregressive cross-lagged  structural model indicated that infant birth conditions impacted 10-year  outcomes via three mechanisms. First, child ER and reciprocal parenting were  individually stable across development and were each predicted by regulatory  birth conditions, describing gradual maturation of ER and reciprocity over time.  Second, better ER skills at one time point were related to greater reciprocity  at the next time point and vice versa, and these cross-time effects defined a  field of individual-context mutual influences that mediated the links between  neonatal RSA and 10-year outcomes. Third, direct associations emerged between  neonatal regulation and outcome, suggesting that birth conditions may establish  a neurobiological milieu that promotes a more mature and resilient system. These  mechanisms describe distinct "attractor" states that constrain the system's  future options, emphasize the importance of defining behavior-based phenotypes  of heterotypic continuity, and suggest that infants may shape their development  by initiating unique cascades of individual-context bidirectional effects.

(Positive) power to the child: The role of children's willing stance toward  parents in developmental cascades from toddler age to early preadolescence.	Kochanska G(1), Kim S(2), Boldt LJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Iowa. (2)Hanyang University.	In a change from the once-dominant view of children as passive in the parent-led  process of socialization, children are now seen as active agents who can  considerably influence that process. However, these newer perspectives typically  focus on the child's antagonistic influence, due either to a difficult  temperament or aversive, resistant, negative behaviors that elicit adversarial  responses from the parent and lead to future coercive cascades in the  relationship. Children's capacity to act as receptive, willing, even  enthusiastic, active socialization agents is largely overlooked. Informed by  attachment theory and other relational perspectives, we depict children as able  to adopt an active willing stance and to exert robust positive influence in the  mutually cooperative socialization enterprise. A longitudinal study of 100  community families (mothers, fathers, and children) demonstrates that willing  stance (a) is a latent construct, observable in diverse parent-child contexts,  parallel at 38, 52, and 67 months and longitudinally stable; (b) originates  within an early secure parent-child relationship at 25 months; and (c) promotes  a positive future cascade toward adaptive outcomes at age 10. The outcomes  include the parent's observed and child-reported positive, responsive behavior,  as well as child-reported internal obligation to obey the parent and  parent-reported low level of child behavior problems. The construct of willing  stance has implications for basic research in typical socialization and in  developmental psychopathology as well as for prevention and intervention.

Externalizing symptoms, effortful control, and intrusive parenting: A test of  bidirectional longitudinal relations during early childhood.	Eisenberg N(1), Taylor ZE(2), Widaman KF(3), Spinrad TL(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University. (2)Purdue University. (3)University of California,Riverside.	At approximately 30, 42, and 54 months of age (N = 231), the relations among  children's externalizing symptoms, intrusive maternal parenting, and children's  effortful control (EC) were examined. Both intrusive parenting and low EC have  been related to psychopathology, but children's externalizing problems and low  EC might affect the quality of parenting and one another. Mothers' intrusive  behavior with their children was assessed with observations, children's EC was  measured with mothers' and caregivers' reports, and children's externalizing  symptoms were assessed with mothers', fathers', and caregivers' reports. In a  structural equation panel model, bidirectional relations between intrusive  parenting and EC were found: EC at 30 and 42 months predicted low levels of  intrusive parenting a year later, controlling for prior levels of parenting and  vice versa. Moreover, high levels of children's externalizing problems at both  30 and 42 months negatively predicted EC a year later, controlling for prior  levels of EC. Although externalizing problems positively predicted high EC over  time, this appeared to be a suppression effect because these variables had a  strong negative pattern in the zero-order correlations. Moreover, when  controlling for the stability of intrusive parenting, EC, and externalizing (all  exhibited significant stability across time) and the aforementioned cross-lagged  predictive paths, EC and externalizing problems were still negatively related  within the 54-month assessment. The findings are consistent with the view that  children's externalizing behavior undermines their EC and contributes to  intrusive mothering and that relations between intrusive parenting and EC are  bidirectional across time. Thus, interventions that focus on modifying  children's externalizing problems (as well as the quality of parenting) might  affect the quality of parenting they receive and, hence, subsequent problems  with adjustment.

Author information: (1)University of Oregon. (2)University of Washington. (3)UCLA Nathanson Family Resilience Center.	Environmental risk predicts disrupted basal cortisol levels in preschool  children. However, little is known about the stability or variability of diurnal  cortisol morning levels or slope patterns over time in young children. This  study used latent profile analysis to identify patterns of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity during the preschool period. Using  a community sample (N = 306), this study measured income, cumulative risk, and  children's diurnal cortisol (morning level and slope) four times across 2.5  years, starting when children were 36 months old. Latent profile analysis  profiles indicated that there were predominantly stable patterns of diurnal  cortisol level and slope over time and that these patterns were predicted by  income and cumulative risk. In addition, there were curvilinear relations of  income and cumulative risk to profiles of low morning cortisol level and  flattened diurnal slope across time, suggesting that both lower and higher  levels of income and cumulative risk were associated with a stress-sensitive  physiological system. Overall, this study provides initial evidence for the role  of environmental risk in predicting lower, flattened basal cortisol patterns  that remain stable over time.

Author information: (1)University of Toronto. (2)University of Delaware.	This article highlights the defining principles, progress, and future directions  in epigenetics research in relation to this Special Issue. Exciting studies in  the fields of neuroscience, psychology, and psychiatry have provided new  insights into the epigenetic factors (e.g., DNA methylation) that are responsive  to environmental input and serve as biological pathways in behavioral  development. Here we highlight the experimental evidence, mainly from animal  models, that factors such as psychosocial stress and environmental adversity can  become encoded within epigenetic factors with functional consequences for brain  plasticity and behavior. We also highlight evidence that epigenetic marking of  genes in one generation can have consequences for future generations (i.e.,  inherited), and work with humans linking epigenetics, cognitive dysfunction, and  psychiatric disorder. Though epigenetics has offered more of a beginning than an  answer to the centuries-old nature-nurture debate, continued research is certain  to yield substantial information regarding biological determinants of central  nervous system changes and behavior with relevance for the study of  developmental psychopathology.

Tyrka AR(1), Parade SH(2), Valentine TR(1), Eslinger NM(1), Seifer R(2).	Author information: (1)Butler Hospital. (2)Brown University Alpert Medical School.	Exposure to early life adversity is linked to impaired affective, cognitive, and  behavioral functioning and increases risk for various psychiatric and medical  conditions. Stress-induced increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines may be a  biological mechanism of these effects. Few studies have examined cytokine levels  in children experiencing early life adversity, and very little research has  investigated cytokines or other markers of inflammation in saliva. In the  present study, we examined salivary interleukin (IL)-1β and C-reactive protein  (CRP) levels in relation to stress exposure in 40 children aged 3 to 5 years who  were enrolled in a larger study of early life adversity. Childhood maltreatment  status was assessed via review of child welfare records. Contextual stress  exposure, traumatic life event history, and symptoms of psychopathology were  assessed via caregiver interviews at a home visit. In a subsequent visit,  salivary IL-1β and CRP were obtained before and after participation in four  emotion-eliciting tasks. The number of past-month contextual stressors, lifetime  contextual stressors, and traumatic life events each demonstrated a significant  main effect on IL-1β. Baseline IL-1β was positively associated with each of the  significant main-effect adversities. Postchallenge IL-1β displayed positive  associations with each adversity variable, but these were not significant. CRP  was not significantly associated with any of the adversity variables. Given the  evidence suggesting the involvement of IL-1β in the neuropathology of  psychiatric conditions, these results may have important implications for  developmental outcomes.

Cicchetti D(1), Handley ED(2), Rogosch FA(2).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development. (2)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	Prior research has found inconsistent evidence regarding the association among  childhood adversity, inflammation, and internalizing symptoms, perhaps because  previous studies have yet to adequately integrate important factors such as the  timing of the adversity, genetic variation, and other relevant processes such as  neuroendocrine regulation. The aims of the present study were threefold: (a) to  determine whether the effect of the timing of child maltreatment on C-reactive  protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, varies by CRP gene variation; (b) to  explore whether links between salivary CRP and childhood internalizing symptoms  depend on the presence and timing of maltreatment experiences; and (c) to  investigate the role of CRP in the relations between child neuroendocrine  regulation and internalizing symptoms and examine whether these associations are  moderated by the presence and timing of child maltreatment. Participants  included a sample of 267 maltreated and 222 nonmaltreated children (M age =  9.72, SD = 0.99; 52.4% male; 66% African American) who attended a summer day  camp research program designed for school-aged low-income children. Department  of Human Services records were examined to determine the onset and recency of  maltreatment for children in the maltreated group. The results indicated that  among children with recent onset maltreatment, those with at least one A allele  from CRP single nucleotide polymorphism rs1417938 evidenced significantly higher  CRP levels compared to recently maltreated children carrying the TT genotype.  Moreover, higher levels of CRP were associated with higher levels of  internalizing symptoms only for recently maltreated children. Finally, we did  not find support for salivary CRP as a mechanism in the relation between  neuroendocrine regulation and childhood internalizing symptoms. Our findings  highlight the importance of the timing of child maltreatment and have important  implications for characterizing variability in inflammation and internalizing  symptoms among youth.

Author information: (1)Birkbeck,University of London.	Resilience and adaptation in the face of early genetic or environmental risk has  become a major interest in child psychiatry over recent years. However, we still  remain far from an understanding of how developing human brains as a whole adapt  to the diffuse and widespread atypical synaptic function that may be  characteristic of some common developmental disorders. The first part of this  paper discusses four types of whole-brain adaptation in the face of early risk:  redundancy, reorganization, niche construction, and adjustment of developmental  rate. The second part of the paper applies these adaptation processes  specifically to autism. We speculate that key features of autism may be the end  result of processes of early brain adaptation, rather than the direct  consequences of ongoing neural pathology.

Prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE) has a well-documented association with  disruptive behavior in childhood, but the neurocognitive effects of exposure  that underlie this link are not sufficiently understood. The present study was  designed to address this gap, through longitudinal follow-up in early childhood  of a prospectively enrolled cohort with well-characterized prenatal exposure.  Three-year-old children (n = 151) were assessed using a developmentally  sensitive battery capturing both cognitive and motivational aspects of  self-regulation. PTE was related to motivational self-regulation, where children  had to delay approach to attractive rewards, but not cognitive self-regulation,  where children had to hold information in mind and inhibit prepotent motor  responses. Furthermore, PTE predicted motivational self-regulation more strongly  in boys than in girls, and when propensity scores were covaried to control for  confounding risk factors, the effect of PTE on motivational self-regulation was  significant only in boys. These findings suggest that PTE's impact on  neurodevelopment may be greater in boys than in girls, perhaps reflecting  vulnerability in neural circuits that subserve reward sensitivity and emotion  regulation, and may also help to explain why PTE is more consistently related to  disruptive behavior disorders than attention problems.

Sensitive periods in human social development: New insights from research on  oxytocin, synchrony, and high-risk parenting.	Feldman R(1).	Author information: (1)Bar-Ilan University.	Sensitive periods (SP) in behavioral development appeared in the biological  sciences during the first decade of the 20th century, and research in animal  models beginning in the 1950s provide terminology and evidence for SP effects.  This paper proposes a rigorous program for human SP research and argues that the  complexity of the human brain and variability of the human ecology necessitate  that SP effects must be studied in humans, employ longitudinal designs starting  at birth, test mechanism-based hypotheses based on animal studies that  manipulate early environments, and utilize high-risk conditions as "natural  experiments." In light of research on the molecular basis of critical periods  and their sequential cascades, it is proposed that the oxytocin (OT) system, an  ancient and integrative system that cross-talks with the stress, reward, immune,  and brain stem mediated homeostatic systems and supports mammalian sociality,  plays a unique role in experience-dependent plasticity that buttresses SP  effects due to its (a) dendritic mode of release leading to autoregulated  functioning primed by early experience, (b) pulsatile pattern of activity, and  (c) special role in neural plasticity at the molecular and network assembly  levels. Synchrony, the coordination of biology and behavior during social  contact, is suggested as a mechanism by which SP exert their effect on OT  functionality, the social brain, and adult sociality. Findings from four  high-risk birth cohorts, each followed repeatedly from birth to 10 years,  provide unique "natural experiments" for human SP research based on specific  programs in animal models. These include prematurity (maternal proximity),  multiple birth (peer rearing), postpartum depression (low licking and grooming),  and chronic unpredictable trauma (maternal rotation, variable foraging demands).  In each cohort, hypotheses are based on the missing environmental component  during SP, and findings on social synchrony, OT functionality, stress response,  emotion regulation, and mental health accord with the multilevel and dynamic  principles of developmental psychopathology. The results on the potential for  reparation versus chronicity following early deprivation highlight a flexible  conceptualization of resilience based on human SP research. Consideration of SP  effects at the molecular, endocrine, brain, and behavioral levels and in  relation to the neural plasticity and multifinality of human social functions  may assist in fine-tuning early detection and the construction of targeted  individualized interventions.

Internalizing symptoms during adolescence and beyond is a major public health  concern, particularly because severe symptoms can lead to the diagnosis of a  number of serious psychiatric conditions. This study utilizes a unique sample  with a complex statistical method in order to explore Gene × Environment  interactions found in internalizing symptoms during adolescence. Data for this  study were drawn from a longitudinal prevention intervention study (n = 798) of  Baltimore city school children. Internalizing symptom data were collected using  self-report and blood or saliva samples genotyped using Affymetrix 6.0  microarrays. A major depression polygenic score was created for each individual  using information from the major depressive disorder Psychiatric Genetics  Consortium and used as a predictor in a latent trait-state-occasion model. The  major depressive disorder polygenic score was a significant predictor of the  stable latent trait variable, which captures time-independent phenotypic  variability. In addition, an early childhood stressor of death or divorce was a  significant predictor of occasion-specific variables. A Gene × Environment  interaction was not a significant predictor of the latent trait or occasion  variables. These findings support the importance of genetics on the stable  latent trait portion of internalizing symptoms across adolescence.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415000401 PMID: 25936925 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Risk factors for the childhood development of co-occurring internalizing and  externalizing symptoms are not well understood, despite a high prevalence and  poor clinical outcomes associated with this co-occurring phenotype. We examined  inherited and environmental risk factors for co-occurring symptoms in a sample  of children adopted at birth and their birth mothers and adoptive mothers (N =  293). Inherited risk factors (i.e., birth mothers' processing speed and  internalizing symptoms) and environmental risk factors (i.e., adoptive mothers'  processing speed, internalizing symptoms, and uninvolved parenting) were  examined as predictors for the development of internalizing-only,  externalizing-only, or co-occurring symptoms using structural equation modeling.  Results suggested a unique pattern of predictive factors for the co-occurring  phenotype, with risk conferred by adoptive mothers' uninvolved parenting, birth  mothers' slower processing speed, and the birth mothers' slower processing speed  in tandem with adoptive mothers' higher internalizing symptoms. Additional  analyses indicated that when co-occurring-symptom children were incorporated  into internalizing and externalizing symptom groups, differential risk factors  for externalizing and internalizing symptoms emerged. The findings suggest that  spurious results may be found when children with co-occurring symptoms are not  examined as a unique phenotypic group.

Social cognitive deficits and biases in maltreated adolescents in U.K.  out-of-home care: Relation to disinhibited attachment disorder and  psychopathology.	Kay CL(1), Green JM(1).	Author information: (1)University of Manchester.	Children entering out-of-home (OoH) care have often experienced multiple forms  of maltreatment and are at risk of psychiatric disorder and poor long-term  outcome. Recent evidence shows high rates of disinhibited attachment disorder  (DAD) among maltreated adolescents in U.K. OoH care (Kay & Green, 2013). This  study aimed to further understand the mechanisms of outcome in this group  through investigation of social cognitive functioning. Patterns of theory of  mind (ToM) and social information processing were assessed alongside DAD  behavior and psychopathology in 63 adolescents in U.K. OoH care (mean age = 176  months, SD = 22; 48% male; 89% White British) and 69 low-risk comparison  adolescents (mean age = 171 months, SD = 17; 46% male; 87% White British).  Compared to low risk, OoH adolescents showed a hostile attribution bias and ToM  deficit, but this was confounded by language ability. ToM was associated with  reduced hostile attribution and responding biases and increased social  competence, which was further associated with lower levels of externalizing  psychopathology. There was no association between social cognition and core  features of DAD. Social cognitive deficits and biases may play a role in the  high rates of externalizing psychopathology and relationship functioning  difficulties in maltreated samples. Future research should assess alternative  cognitive mechanisms for DAD.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415000292 PMID: 25851172 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Susceptibility effects of GABA receptor subunit alpha-2 (GABRA2) variants and  parental monitoring on externalizing behavior trajectories: Risk and protection  conveyed by the minor allele.	Trucco EM(1), Villafuerte S(1), Heitzeg MM(1), Burmeister M(1), Zucker RA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Michigan.	Understanding factors increasing susceptibility to social contexts and  predicting psychopathology can help identify targets for prevention.  Persistently high externalizing behavior in adolescence is predictive of  psychopathology in adulthood. Parental monitoring predicts low externalizing  behavior, yet youth likely vary in the degree to which they are affected by  parents. Genetic variants of GABA receptor subunit alpha-2 (GABRA2) may increase  susceptibility to parental monitoring, thus impacting externalizing  trajectories. We had several objectives: (a) to determine whether GABRA2  (rs279827, rs279826, rs279858) moderates the relationship between a component of  parental monitoring, parental knowledge, and externalizing trajectories; (b) to  test the form of this interaction to assess whether GABRA2 variants reflect risk  (diathesis-stress) or susceptibility (differential susceptibility) factors; and  (c) to clarify GABRA2 associations on the development of problem behavior. This  prospective study (N = 504) identified three externalizing trajectory classes  (i.e., low, decreasing, and high) across adolescence. A GABRA2 × Parental  Monitoring effect on class membership was observed, such that A-carriers were  largely unaffected by parental monitoring, whereas class membership for those  with the GG genotype was affected by parental monitoring. Findings support  differential susceptibility in GABRA2.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415000255 PMCID: PMC4580498 PMID: 25797587 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The aim of the study was to examine possible influences on individual  differences in adolescence in response to early institutional care in infancy  not involving either generalized privation or subnutrition. Fifty-two adopted  adolescents aged 13 years who received institutional care in infancy at the  Metera Babies Centre and 36 adolescents of the same age who were raised in their  biological families participated in the study. Adolescents' attachment  relationships, cognition, behavioral adjustment and use of psychological  services were assessed. Marked heterogeneity in outcomes was found. No  predictive effects were found for preinstitutional features or for adoptive  circumstances. By contrast a large effect was found for institutional care  extending beyond the age of 2 years and for quality of institutional care as  experienced at an individual level. There was a close association between  prolonged institutional care and disorganized attachment while in the  institution, but the main institutional effect derived from the length of time  in the institution.

Genetic differential susceptibility on trial: meta-analytic support from  randomized controlled experiments.	van Ijzendoorn MH(1), Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ(1).	Author information: (1)Leiden University.	The most stringent test of differential susceptibility theory is provided by  randomized control trials examining the moderating role of genetic markers of  differential susceptibility in experimental manipulations of the environment  (Gene × Experimental Environment interactions), being at least 10 times more  powerful than correlational Gene × Environment interaction studies. We  identified 22 experiments involving 3,257 participants with various  developmental outcomes (e.g., externalizing problems, internalizing behaviors,  and cognitive development). Effect sizes contrasting experimental versus control  group were computed both for subjects with the polymorphism considered  indicative of heightened susceptibility (e.g., the dopamine receptor D4 gene  seven-repeat allele and the serotonin transporter polymorphic region short  allele) and others expected to be low in susceptibility (e.g., the dopamine  receptor D4 gene four-repeat allele and the serotonin transporter polymorphic  region short allele). Clear-cut experimental support for genetic differential  susceptibility emerged: the combined effect size of the interventions for the  susceptible genotypes amounted to r = .33 (95% confidence interval = 0.23, 0.42;  p < .01) versus a nonsignificant r = .08 (95% confidence interval = -0.02, 0.17;  p = .12) for the hypothesized nonsusceptible genotypes. Macrotrials showed more  evidence of genetic differential susceptibility than microtrials, and  differential susceptibility was more clearly observed in trials with  externalizing and cognitive outcomes than with internalizing problems. This  meta-analysis shows proof of principle for genetic differential susceptibility  and indicates that it is time to explore its mechanisms and limits. The concept  of differential susceptibility alters the idea of constitutional "risk" factors  (reactive temperament and risk genotypes), and points to intervention efficacy  hidden in Gene × Environment interactions.

(#)Contributed equally	We examined caregiver report of externalizing behavior from 12 to 54 months of  age in 102 children randomized to care as usual in institutions or to newly  created high-quality foster care. At baseline no differences by group or  genotype in externalizing were found. However, changes in externalizing from  baseline to 42 months of age were moderated by the serotonin transporter linked  polymorphic region genotype and intervention group, where the slope for  short-short (S/S) individuals differed as a function of intervention group. The  slope for individuals carrying the long allele did not significantly differ  between groups. At 54 months of age, S/S children in the foster care group had  the lowest levels of externalizing behavior, while children with the S/S  genotype in the care as usual group demonstrated the highest rates of  externalizing behavior. No intervention group differences were found in  externalizing behavior among children who carried the long allele. These  findings, within a randomized controlled trial of foster care compared to  continued care as usual, indicate that the serotonin transporter linked  polymorphic region genotype moderates the relation between early caregiving  environments to predict externalizing behavior in children exposed to early  institutional care in a manner most consistent with differential susceptibility.

Tone EB(1), Tully EC(1).	Author information: (1)Georgia State University.	Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2016 Nov;28(4pt2):1567.	Learning to respond to others' distress with well-regulated empathy is an  important developmental task linked to positive health outcomes and moral  achievements. However, this important interpersonal skill set may also confer  risk for depression and anxiety when present at extreme levels and in  combination with certain individual characteristics or within particular  contexts. The purpose of this review is to describe an empirically grounded  theoretical rationale for the hypothesis that empathic tendencies can be "risky  strengths." We propose a model in which typical development of affective and  cognitive empathy can be influenced by complex interplay among intraindividual  and interindividual moderators that increase risk for empathic personal distress  and excessive interpersonal guilt. These intermediate states in turn precipitate  internalizing problems that map onto empirically derived fear/arousal and  anhedonia/misery subfactors of internalizing disorders. The intraindividual  moderators include a genetically influenced propensity toward physiological  hyperarousal, which is proposed to interact with genetic propensity to empathic  sensitivity to contribute to neurobiological processes that underlie personal  distress responses to others' pain or unhappiness. This empathic personal  distress then increases risk for internalizing problems, particularly  fear/arousal symptoms. In a similar fashion, interactions between genetic  propensities toward negative thinking processes and empathic sensitivity are  hypothesized to contribute to excess interpersonal guilt in response to others'  distress. This interpersonal guilt then increases the risk for internalizing  problems, especially anhedonia/misery symptoms. Interindividual moderators, such  as maladaptive parenting or chronic exposure to parents' negative affect,  further interact with these genetic liabilities to amplify risk for personal  distress and interpersonal guilt as well as for consequent internalizing  problems. Age-related increases in the heritability of depression, anxiety, and  empathy-related constructs are consistent with developmental shifts toward  greater influence of intraindividual moderators throughout childhood and  adolescence, with interindividual moderators exerting their greatest influence  during early childhood. Efforts to modulate neurobiological and behavioral  expressions of genetic dysregulation liabilities and to promote adaptive  empathic skills must thus begin early in development.

The current study filled significant gaps in our knowledge of developmental  psychopathology by examining the influence of multilevel risk factors and  developmental assets on longitudinal trajectories of internalizing symptoms and  self-esteem in an exceptionally culturally diverse sample of rural adolescents.  Integrating ecological and social capital theories, we explored if positive  microsystem transactions are associated with self-esteem while negative  microsystem transactions increase the chances of internalizing problems. Data  came from the Rural Adaptation Project, a 5-year longitudinal panel study of  more than 4,000 middle school students from 28 public schools in two rural,  disadvantaged counties in North Carolina. Three-level hierarchical linear  modeling models were estimated to predict internalizing symptoms (e.g.,  depression, anxiety) and self-esteem. Relative to other students, risk for  internalizing problems and low self-esteem was elevated for aggressive  adolescents, students who were hassled or bullied at school, and those who were  rejected by peers or in conflict with their parents. Internalizing problems were  also more common among adolescents from socioeconomically disadvantaged families  and neighborhoods, among those in schools with more suspensions, in students who  reported being pressured by peers, and in youth who required more teacher  support. It is likely that these experiences left adolescents disengaged from  developing social capital from ecological microsystems (e.g., family, school,  peers). On the positive side, support from parents and friends and optimism  about the future were key assets associated with lower internalizing symptoms  and higher self-esteem. Self-esteem was also positively related to religious  orientation, school satisfaction, and future optimism. These variables show  active engagement with ecological microsystems. The implications and limitations  were discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414001163 PMID: 25422975 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Wilson S(1), Vaidyanathan U(1), Miller MB(1), McGue M(1), Iacono WG(1).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota.	Premorbid risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) and predictors of an earlier  onset and recurrent course were examined in two studies in a large,  community-based sample of parents and offspring, prospectively assessed from  late childhood into adulthood. In Study 1 (N = 2,764 offspring and their  parents), parental psychiatric status, offspring personality at age 11, and age  11 offspring internalizing and externalizing symptoms predicted the subsequent  development of MDD, as did poor quality parent-child relationships, poor  academic functioning, early pubertal development, and childhood maltreatment by  age 11. Parental MDD and adult antisocial behavior, offspring negative  emotionality and disconstraint, externalizing symptoms, and childhood  maltreatment predicted an earlier onset of MDD, after accounting for course;  lower positive emotionality, trait anxiety, and childhood maltreatment predicted  recurrent MDD, after accounting for age of onset. In Study 2 (N = 7,146), we  examined molecular genetic risk for MDD by extending recent reports of  associations with glutamatergic system genes. We failed to confirm associations  with MDD using either individual single nucleotide polymorphism based tests or  gene-based analyses. Overall, results speak to the pervasiveness of risk for  MDD, as well as specific risk for early onset MDD; risk for recurrent MDD  appears to be largely a function of its often earlier onset.

For  example, parental depression and cognitive vulnerability are known markers of  depression risk, but no study has examined their interactive effects on  children's cortisol reactivity, a likely mediator of early depression risk. We  examined relations across these different levels of vulnerability using  cross-sectional and longitudinal methods in two community samples of children.  Children were assessed for cognitive vulnerability using self-reports (Study 1;  n = 244) and tasks tapping memory and attentional bias (Study 2; n = 205), and  their parents were assessed for depression history using structured clinical  interviews. In both samples, children participated in standardized stress tasks  and cortisol reactivity was assessed. Cross-sectionally and longitudinally,  parental depression history and child cognitive vulnerability interacted to  predict children's cortisol reactivity; associations between parent depression  and elevated child cortisol activity were found when children also showed  elevated depressotypic attributions as well as attentional and memory biases.  Findings indicate that models of children's emerging depression risk may benefit  from the examination of the interactive effects of multiple sources of  vulnerability across levels of analysis.

Author information: (1)Meharry Medical College. (2)Southern Methodist University. (3)Vanderbilt University.	The stress generation hypothesis was tested in two different longitudinal  studies examining relations between weekly depression symptom ratings and stress  levels in adolescents and emerging adults at varied risk for depression. The  participants in Study 1 included 240 adolescents who differed with regard to  their mothers' history of depressive disorders. Youth were assessed annually  across 6 years (Grades 6-12). Consistent with the depression autonomy model,  higher numbers of prior major depressive episodes (MDEs) were associated with  weaker stress generation effects, such that higher levels of depressive symptoms  predicted increases in levels of dependent stressors for adolescents with two or  more prior MDEs, but depressive symptoms were not significantly related to  dependent stress levels for youth with three or more prior MDEs. In Study 2, the  participants were 32 remitted-depressed and 36 never-depressed young adults who  completed a psychosocial stress task to determine cortisol reactivity and were  reassessed for depression and stress approximately 8 months later. Stress  generation effects were moderated by cortisol responses to a laboratory  psychosocial stressor, such that individuals with higher cortisol responses  exhibited a pattern consistent with the depression autonomy model, whereas  individuals with lower cortisol responses showed a pattern more consistent with  the depression sensitization model. Finally, comparing across the two samples,  stress generation effects were weaker for older participants and for those with  more prior MDEs. The complex, multifactorial relation between stress and  depression is discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414001096 PMCID: PMC4244661 PMID: 25422968 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Key brain measures included amygdala volume  and amygdala activation to an emotion face-viewing task. Key hormone measures  included cortisol levels during a social stress task and during the brain scan.  MDD and HC adolescents showed group differences on amygdala functioning and  patterns of cortisol levels. Amygdala activation in response to emotional  stimuli was positively associated with cortisol responses. In addition, amygdala  volume was correlated with cortisol responses, but the pattern differed in  depressed versus healthy adolescents, most notably for unmedicated MDD  adolescents. The findings highlight the value of using multilevel assessment  strategies to enhance understanding of pathophysiology of adolescent MDD,  particularly regarding how closely related biological threat systems function  together while undergoing significant developmental shifts.

Brain-behavior relationships in the experience and regulation of negative  emotion in healthy children: implications for risk for childhood depression.	Pagliaccio D(1), Luby JL(1), Luking KR(1), Belden AC(1), Barch DM(1).	Author information: (1)Washington University in St. Louis.	Structural and functional alterations in a variety of brain regions have been  associated with depression and risk for depression across the life span. A  majority of these regions are associated with emotion reactivity and/or  regulation. However, it is generally unclear what mechanistic role these  alterations play in the etiology of depression. A first step toward  understanding this is to characterize the relationships between variation in  brain structure/function and individual differences in depression severity and  related processes, particularly emotion regulation. To this end, the current  study examines how brain structure and function predict concurrent and  longitudinal measures of depression symptomology and emotion regulation skills  in psychiatrically healthy school-age children (N = 60). Specifically, we found  that smaller hippocampus volumes and greater responses to sad faces in emotion  reactivity regions predict increased depressive symptoms at the time of scan,  whereas larger amygdala volumes, smaller insula volumes, and greater responses  in emotion reactivity regions predict decreased emotion regulation skills. In  addition, larger insula volumes predict improvements in emotion regulation  skills even after accounting for emotion regulation at the time of scan.  Understanding brain-behavior relationships in psychiatrically healthy samples,  especially early in development, will help inform normative developmental  trajectories and neural alterations in depression and other affective pathology.

Interpersonal cognitive biases as genetic markers for pediatric depressive  symptoms: twin data from the emotions, cognitions, heredity and outcome (ECHO)  study.	Lau JY(1), Belli SR(1), Gregory AM(2), Eley TC(3).	Author information: (1)University of Oxford. (2)Goldsmiths College. (3)King's College London Institute of Psychiatry.	Childhood depressive symptoms may arise from genetic and environmental risks,  which act to bias the ways in which children process emotional information.  Previous studies show that several "cognitive biases" are heritable and share  genetic and environmental risks with depressive symptoms. Past research suggests  that many cognitive biases only reflect genetic risks for depressive symptoms  from adolescence. The present study sought to identify (a) when interpersonal  cognitions mature as risk factors for depressive symptoms by examining whether  these factors are stable and predict symptoms across time in childhood, and (b)  the extent to which interpersonal cognitions reflect inherited/environmental  risks on children's depressive symptoms. Results showed that there was some  stability for interpersonal cognitive biases from age 8 to 10 years (rs =  .32-.43). Only the absence of positive self/other perceptions, and negative peer  and mother expectations at age 8 predicted depressive symptoms at age 10 (after  controlling for depressive symptoms at age 8). The absence of positive  self/other perceptions shared genetic influences with depressive symptoms within  and across time. Across middle to late childhood, interpersonal cognitions begin  to operate as vulnerability-trait factors for depressive symptoms, gradually  reflecting distal genetic risks on symptoms.

Genetic moderation of child maltreatment effects on depression and internalizing  symptoms by serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR),  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), norepinephrine transporter (NET), and  corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) genes in African American  children.	Cicchetti D(1), Rogosch FA(2).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development. (2)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	Genetic moderation of the effects of child maltreatment on depression and  internalizing symptoms was investigated in a sample of low-income maltreated and  nonmaltreated African American children (N = 1,096). Lifetime child maltreatment  experiences were independently coded from Child Protective Services records and  maternal report. Child depression and internalizing problems were assessed in  the context of a summer research camp by self-report on the Children's  Depression Inventory and adult counselor report on the Teacher Report Form. DNA  was obtained from buccal cell or saliva samples and genotyped for polymorphisms  of the following genes: serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region  (5-HTTLPR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), norepinephrine  transporter, and corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1. Analyses of  covariance with age and gender as covariates were conducted, with maltreatment  status and respective polymorphism as main effects and their Gene × Environment  (G × E) interactions. Maltreatment consistently was associated with higher  Children's Depression Inventory and Teacher Report Form symptoms. The results  for child self-report symptoms indicated a G × E interaction for BDNF and  maltreatment. In addition, BDNF and triallelic 5-HTTLPR interacted with child  maltreatment in a G × G × E interaction. Analyses for counselor report of child  anxiety/depression symptoms on the Teacher Report Form indicated moderation of  child maltreatment effects by triallelic 5-HTTLPR. These effects were elaborated  based on variation in developmental timing of maltreatment experiences.  Norepinephrine transporter was found to further moderate the G × E interaction  of 5-HTTLPR and maltreatment status, revealing a G × G × E interaction. This G ×  G × E was extended by consideration of variation in maltreatment subtype  experiences. Finally, G × G × E effects were observed for the co-action of BDNF  and the corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 haplotype. The findings  illustrate the variable influence of specific genotypes in G × E interactions  based on variation in maltreatment experiences and the importance of a  multigenic approach for understanding influences on depression and internalizing  symptoms among African American children.

Child-evoked maternal negativity from 9 to 27 months: Evidence of  gene-environment correlation and its moderation by marital distress.

Past research has documented pervasive genetic influences on emotional and  behavioral disturbance across the life span and on liability to adult  psychiatric disorder. Increasingly, interest is turning to mechanisms of  gene-environment interplay in attempting to understand the earliest  manifestations of genetic risk. We report findings from a prospective adoption  study, which aimed to test the role of evocative gene-environment correlation in  early development. Included in the study were 561 infants adopted at birth and  studied between 9 and 27 months, along with their adoptive parents and birth  mothers. Birth mother psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms scales were used as  indicators of genetic influence, and multiple self-report measures were used to  index adoptive mother parental negativity. We hypothesized that birth mother  psychopathology would be associated with greater adoptive parent negativity and  that such evocative effects would be amplified under conditions of high adoptive  family adversity. The findings suggested that genetic factors associated with  birth mother externalizing psychopathology may evoke negative reactions in  adoptive mothers in the first year of life, but only when the adoptive family  environment is characterized by marital problems. Maternal negativity mediated  the effects of genetic risk on child adjustment at 27 months. The results  underscore the importance of genetically influenced evocative processes in early  development.

Poverty, household chaos, and interparental aggression predict children's  ability to recognize and modulate negative emotions.

(2)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.	The following prospective longitudinal study considers the ways that protracted  exposure to verbal and physical aggression between parents may take a  substantial toll on emotional adjustment for 1,025 children followed from 6 to  58 months of age. Exposure to chronic poverty from infancy to early childhood as  well as multiple measures of household chaos were also included as predictors of  children's ability to recognize and modulate negative emotions in order to  disentangle the role of interparental conflict from the socioeconomic forces  that sometimes accompany it. Analyses revealed that exposure to greater levels  of interparental conflict, more chaos in the household, and a higher number of  years in poverty can be empirically distinguished as key contributors to  58-month-olds' ability to recognize and modulate negative emotion. Implications  for models of experiential canalization of emotional processes within the  context of adversity are discussed.

Very extensive nonmaternal care predicts mother-infant attachment  disorganization: Convergent evidence from two samples.	Hazen NL(1), Allen SD(2), Christopher CH(3), Umemura T(4), Jacobvitz DB(1).	Author information: (1)University of Texas at Austin. (2)Charles Sturt University. (3)Arizona State University. (4)Masaryk University.	We examined whether a maximum threshold of time spent in nonmaternal care  exists, beyond which infants have an increased risk of forming a disorganized  infant-mother attachment. The hours per week infants spent in nonmaternal care  at 7-8 months were examined as a continuous measure and as a dichotomous  threshold (over 40, 50 and 60 hr/week) to predict infant disorganization at  12-15 months. Two different samples (Austin and NICHD) were used to replicate  findings and control for critical covariates: mothers' unresolved status and  frightening behavior (assessed in the Austin sample, N = 125), quality of  nonmaternal caregiving (assessed in the NICHD sample, N = 1,135), and family  income and infant temperament (assessed in both samples). Only very extensive  hours of nonmaternal care (over 60 hr/week) and mothers' frightening behavior  independently predicted attachment disorganization. A polynomial logistic  regression performed on the larger NICHD sample indicated that the risk of  disorganized attachment exponentially increased after exceeding 60 hr/week. In  addition, very extensive hours of nonmaternal care only predicted attachment  disorganization after age 6 months (not prior). Findings suggest that during a  sensitive period of attachment formation, infants who spend more than 60 hr/week  in nonmaternal care may be at an increased risk of forming a disorganized  attachment.

Horan JM(1), Widom CS(1).	Author information: (1)John Jay College of Criminal Justice.	This paper examines the relationship between childhood exposure to cumulative  risk and three indicators of psychosocial adjustment in adulthood (educational  attainment, mental health, and criminal behavior) and tests three different  models (linear, quadratic, and interaction). Data were collected over several  time points from individuals who were part of a prospective cohort design study  that matched children with documented cases of abuse and/or neglect with  children without such histories and followed them into adulthood. Hierarchical  multiple regressions compared linear and quadratic models and then examined  potential moderating effects of child abuse/neglect and gender. Exposure to a  greater number of childhood risk factors was significantly related to fewer  years of education, more anxiety and depression symptomatology, and more  criminal arrests in adulthood. The relationship between cumulative risk and  years of education demonstrated a curvilinear pattern, whereas the relationship  between cumulative risk and both mental health and criminal arrests was linear.  Child abuse/neglect did not moderate these relationships, although there were  direct effects for both child abuse/neglect and gender on criminal arrests, with  more arrests for abused/neglected individuals than controls and more for males  than females. Gender interacted with cumulative risk to impact educational  attainment and criminal behavior, suggesting that interventions may be more  effective if tailored differently for males and females. Interventions may need  to be multifaceted and designed to address these different domains of  functioning.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941400090X PMCID: PMC5308061 PMID: 25196178 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)University of Notre Dame. (2)Harvard University. (3)Yale University School of Medicine.	In this study, we employed an eye-gaze paradigm to explore whether children  (ages 8-12) and adolescents (ages 12-18) with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)  are able to use prosodic cues to determine the syntactic structure of an  utterance. Persons with ASD were compared to typically developing (TD) peers  matched on age, IQ, gender, and receptive language abilities. The stimuli were  syntactically ambiguous but had a prosodic break that indicated the appropriate  interpretation (feel the frog … with the feather vs. feel … the frog with the  feather). We found that all groups were equally sensitive to the initial  prosodic cues that were presented. Children and teens with ASD used prosody to  interpret the ambiguous phrase as rapidly and efficiently as their TD peers.  However, when a different cue was presented in subsequent trials, the younger  ASD group was more likely to respond in a manner consistent with the initial  prosodic cue rather than the new one. Eye-tracking data indicated that both  younger groups (ASD and TD) had trouble shifting their interpretation as the  prosodic cue changed, but the younger TD group was able to overcome this  interference and produce an action consistent with the prosodic cue.

(3)Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.	Based on an emerging neuroscience model of addiction, this study examines how an  imbalance between two neurobehavioral systems (reward motivation and executive  control) can distinguish between early adolescent progressive drug use and mere  experimentation with drugs. Data from four annual assessments of a community  cohort (N = 382) of 11- to 13-year-olds were analyzed to model heterogeneity in  patterns of early drug use. Baseline assessments of working memory (an indicator  of the functional integrity of the executive control system) and three  dimensions of impulsivity (characterizing the balance between reward seeking and  executive control systems) were used to predict heterogeneous latent classes of  drug use trajectories from early to midadolescence. Findings revealed that an  imbalance resulting from weak executive control and heightened reward seeking  was predictive of early progression in drug use, while heightened reward seeking  balanced by a strong control system was predictive of occasional experimentation  only. Implications of these results are discussed in terms of preventive  interventions that can target underlying weaknesses in executive control during  younger years, and potentially enable at-risk adolescents to exercise greater  self-restraint in the context of rewarding drug-related cues.

St Clair MC(1), Croudace T(2), Dunn VJ(1), Jones PB(1), Herbert J(1), Goodyer  IM(1).	Author information: (1)University of Cambridge. (2)University of York.	Within a longitudinal study of 1,005 adolescents, we investigated how exposure  to childhood psychosocial adversities was associated with the emergence of  depressive symptoms between 14 and 17 years of age. The cohort was classified  into four empirically determined adversity subtypes for two age periods in  childhood (0-5 and 6-11 years). One subtype reflects normative/optimal family  environments (n = 692, 69%), while the other three subtypes reflect differential  suboptimal family environments (aberrant parenting: n = 71, 7%; discordant: n =  185, 18%; and hazardous: n = 57, 6%). Parent-rated child temperament at 14 years  and adolescent self-reported recent negative life events in early and late  adolescence were included in models implementing path analysis. There were  gender-differentiated associations between childhood adversity subtypes and  adolescent depressive symptoms. The discordant and hazardous subtypes were  associated with elevated depressive symptoms in both genders but the aberrant  parenting subtype only so in girls. Across adolescence the associations between  early childhood adversity and depressive symptoms diminished for boys but  remained for girls. Emotional temperament was also associated with depressive  symptoms in both genders, while proximal negative life events related to  depressive symptoms in girls only. There may be neurodevelopmental factors that  emerge in adolescence that reduce depressogenic symptoms in boys but increase  such formation in girls.

Parenting, relational aggression, and borderline personality features:  associations over time in a Russian longitudinal sample.	Nelson DA(1), Coyne SM(1), Swanson SM(1), Hart CH(1), Olsen JA(1).	Author information: (1)Brigham Young University.	Crick, Murray-Close, and Woods (2005) encouraged the study of relational  aggression as a developmental precursor to borderline personality features in  children and adolescents. A longitudinal study is needed to more fully explore  this association, to contrast potential associations with physical aggression,  and to assess generalizability across various cultural contexts. In addition,  parenting is of particular interest in the prediction of aggression or  borderline personality disorder. Early aggression and parenting experiences may  differ in their long-term prediction of aggression or borderline features, which  may have important implications for early intervention. The currrent study  incorporated a longitudinal sample of preschool children (84 boys, 84 girls)  living in intact, two-parent biological households in Voronezh, Russia. Teachers  provided ratings of children's relational and physical aggression in preschool.  Mothers and fathers also self-reported their engagement in authoritative,  authoritarian, permissive, and psychological controlling forms of parenting with  their preschooler. A decade later, 70.8% of the original child participants  consented to a follow-up study in which they completed self-reports of  relational and physical aggression and borderline personality features. The  multivariate results of this study showed that preschool relational aggression  in girls predicted adolescent relational aggression. Preschool aversive  parenting (i.e., authoritarian, permissive, and psychologically controlling  forms) significantly predicted aggression and borderline features in adolescent  females. For adolescent males, preschool authoritative parenting served as a  protective factor against aggression and borderline features, whereas  authoritarian parenting was a risk factor for later aggression.

Author information: (1)Philadelphia Collaborative Violence Prevention Center. (2)Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Violence Prevention Initiative.	Urban ethnic minority youth are often exposed to high levels of aggression and  violence. As such, many aggression intervention programs that have been designed  with suburban nonethnic minority youth have been used or slightly adapted in  order to try and meet the needs of high-risk urban youth. The current study  contributes to the literature base by examining how well a range of  social-cognitive, emotional distress and victimization, and prosocial factors  are related to youth aggression in a sample of urban youth. This study utilized  data gathered from 109 9- to 15-year-old youth (36.7% male; 84.4% African  American) and their parents or caregivers. A series of hierarchical multiple  regressions were fit predicting youth aggression from social-cognitive  variables, victimization and distress, and prosocial variables, controlling for  youth gender and age. Each set of variables explained a significant and unique  amount of the variance in youth aggressive behavior. The full model including  all predictors accounted for 41% of the variance in aggression. Models suggest  that youth with stronger beliefs supportive of violence, youth who experience  more overt victimization, and youth who experience greater distress in overtly  aggressive situations are likely to be more aggressive. In contrast, youth with  higher self-esteem and youth who endorse greater leadership efficacy are likely  to be less aggressive. Contrary to hypotheses, hostile attributional bias and  knowledge of social information processing, experience of relational  victimization, distress in relationally aggressive situations, and community  engagement were not associated with aggression. Our study is one of the first to  address these important questions for low-income, predominately ethnic minority  urban youth, and it has clear implications for adapting aggression prevention  programs to be culturally sensitive for urban African American youth.

Wade M(1), Moore C(2), Astington JW(1), Frampton K(1), Jenkins JM(1).	Author information: (1)University of Toronto. (2)Dalhousie University.	By 18 months children demonstrate a range of social-cognitive skills that can be  considered important precursors to more advanced forms of social understanding  such as theory of mind. Although individual differences in social cognition have  been linked to neurocognitive maturation, sociocultural models of development  suggest that environmental influences operate in the development of children's  social-cognitive outcomes. In the current study of 501 children and their  mothers, we tested and found support for a model in which distal environmental  risk, assessed when children were newborns, was indirectly associated with  children's social-cognitive competency at 18 months through mothers'  responsivity at 18 months. Part of this effect also operated through children's  concomitant language skills, suggesting both a language-mediated and a  language-independent mechanism of social-cognitive development. These findings  are discussed with respect to the Vygotskian themes of internalization and  semiotic mediation.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414000674 PMID: 25017298 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2014 Nov;26(4 Pt 1):1185-8.	Building on research on cumulative risk and psychopathology, this study examines  how cumulative risk exposure is associated with altered diurnal cortisol rhythms  in an ethnically diverse, low-income sample of youth. In addition, consistent  with a diathesis-stress perspective, this study explores whether the effect of  environmental risk is moderated by allelic variation in the promoter region of  the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). Results  show that youth with greater cumulative risk exposure had flatter diurnal  cortisol slopes, regardless of 5-HTTLPR genotype. However, the association of  cumulative risk with average cortisol output (area under the curve [AUC]) was  moderated by the 5-HTTLPR genotype. Among youth homozygous for the long allele,  greater cumulative risk exposure was associated with lower cortisol AUC, driven  by significant reductions in cortisol levels at waking. In contrast, there was a  trend-level association between greater cumulative risk and higher cortisol AUC  among youth carrying the short allele, driven by a trend-level increase in  bedtime cortisol levels. Findings are discussed with regard to the relevance of  dysregulated diurnal cortisol rhythms for the development of psychopathology and  the implications of genetically mediated differences in psychophysiological  adaptations to stress.

Oldehinkel AJ(1), Ormel J(1), Verhulst FC(2), Nederhof E(1).	Author information: (1)University of Groningen University Medical Center Groningen. (2)Erasmus University Medical Center Sophia Children's Hospital.	Childhood adversities have been proposed to modify later stress sensitivity and  risk of depressive disorder in several ways: by stress sensitization, stress  amplification, and stress inoculation. Combining these models, we hypothesized  that childhood adversities would increase risk of early, but not later, onsets  of depression (Hypothesis 1). In those without an early onset, childhood  adversities were hypothesized to predict a relatively low risk of depression in  high-stress conditions (Hypothesis 2a) and a relatively high risk of depression  in low-stress conditions (Hypothesis 2b), compared to no childhood adversities.  These hypotheses were tested in 1,584 participants of the Tracking Adolescents'  Individual Lives Survey, a prospective cohort study of adolescents. Childhood  adversities were assessed retrospectively at ages 11 and 13.5, using  self-reports and parent reports. Lifetime DSM-IV major depressive episodes were  assessed at age 19, by means of the Composite International Diagnostic  Interview. Stressful life events during adolescence were established using  interview-based contextual ratings of personal and network events. The results  provided support for all hypotheses, regardless of the informant and timeframe  used to assess childhood adversities and regardless of the nature (personal vs.  network, dependent vs. independent) of recent stressful events. These findings  suggest that age at first onset of depression may be an effective marker to  distinguish between various types of reaction patterns.

By means of growth mixture modeling, three developmental trajectories  were identified for anxious symptoms: steady low (82%), moderate  increasing-decreasing (5.9%), and high declining groups (12.1%). For depressive  symptoms, two developmental trajectories were found: steady low (94.1%) and  moderate increasing groups (5.9%). Higher shyness, irritability, and altruism  predicted membership in more problematic anxious and depressive groups. The  personality facets energy, optimism, compliance, and anxiety were unique  predictors for class membership for anxious symptoms, and the effects of  shyness, irritability, and compliance were moderated by overreactive parenting.  Shyness and irritability increased the probability of following the moderate  increasing-decreasing anxiety trajectory, but only in the context of high or  average levels of overreactive parenting. Compliance increased the probability  of following the moderate increasing-decreasing and high decreasing trajectories  in the context of high overreactive parenting. Our results indicate that  childhood personality facets differentiate trajectories of anxious and  depressive symptoms in theoretically compelling ways.

This study examined whether parents' social information processing was related  to their subsequent reports of their harsh discipline. Interviews were conducted  with mothers (n = 1,277) and fathers (n = 1,030) of children in 1,297 families  in nine countries (China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines,  Sweden, Thailand, and the United States), initially when children were 7 to 9  years old and again 1 year later. Structural equation models showed that  parents' positive evaluations of aggressive responses to hypothetical  childrearing vignettes at Time 1 predicted parents' self-reported harsh physical  and nonphysical discipline at Time 2. This link was consistent across mothers  and fathers, and across the nine countries, providing support for the  universality of the link between positive evaluations of harsh discipline and  parents' aggressive behavior toward children. The results suggest that  international efforts to eliminate violence toward children could target  parents' beliefs about the acceptability and advisability of using harsh  physical and nonphysical forms of discipline.

The effect of neighborhood disadvantage, social ties, and genetic variation on  the antisocial behavior of African American women: a multilevel analysis.	Lei MK(1), Simons RL(2), Edmond MB(3), Simons LG(2), Cutrona CE(4).	Author information: (1)University of Georgia. (2)Arizona State University. (3)Piedmont College. (4)Iowa State University.	Social disorganization theory posits that individuals who live in disadvantaged  neighborhoods are more likely to engage in antisocial behavior than are those  who live in advantaged neighborhoods and that neighborhood disadvantage asserts  this effect through its disruptive impact on social ties. Past research on this  framework has been limited in two respects. First, most studies have  concentrated on adolescent males. In contrast, the present study focused on a  sample of adult African American females. Second, past research has largely  ignored individual-level factors that might explain why people who grow up in  disadvantaged neighborhoods often do not engage in antisocial behavior. We  investigated the extent to which genetic variation contributes to heterogeneity  of response to neighborhood conditions. We found that the impact of neighborhood  disadvantage on antisocial behavior was mediated by neighborhood social ties.  Further, the analysis indicated that the effects of neighborhood disadvantage  and social ties on antisocial behavior were moderated by genetic polymorphisms.  Examination of these moderating effects provided support for the differential  susceptibility model of Gene × Environment. The effect of Gene × Neighborhood  Disadvantage on antisocial behavior was mediated by the effect of Gene ×  Neighborhood Social Ties, providing support for an expanded view of social  disorganization theory.

(4)King's College London.	Associations between low birth weight and prenatal anxiety and later  psychopathology may arise from programming effects likely to be adaptive under  some, but not other, environmental exposures and modified by sex differences. If  physiological reactivity, which also confers vulnerability or resilience in an  environment-dependent manner, is associated with birth weight and prenatal  anxiety, it will be a candidate to mediate the links with psychopathology. From  a general population sample of 1,233 first-time mothers recruited at 20 weeks  gestation, a sample of 316 stratified by adversity was assessed at 32 weeks and  when their infants were aged 29 weeks (N = 271). Prenatal anxiety was assessed  by self-report, birth weight from medical records, and vagal reactivity from  respiratory sinus arrhythmia during four nonstressful and one stressful  (still-face) procedure. Lower birth weight for gestational age predicted higher  vagal reactivity only in girls (interaction term, p = .016), and prenatal  maternal anxiety predicted lower vagal reactivity only in boys (interaction  term, p = .014). These findings are consistent with sex differences in fetal  programming, whereby prenatal risks are associated with increased stress  reactivity in females but decreased reactivity in males, with distinctive  advantages and penalties for each sex.

Prenatal cocaine exposure and trajectories of externalizing behavior problems in  early childhood: examining the role of maternal negative affect.	Molnar DS(1), Levitt A(1), Eiden RD(1), Schuetze P(2).	Author information: (1)State University of New York at Buffalo. (2)Buffalo State College.	This study examined the association between prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) and  developmental trajectories of externalizing behavior problems from 18 to 54  months of child age. A hypothesized indirect association between PCE and  externalizing trajectories via maternal negative affect was also examined.  Caregiving environmental risk and child sex were evaluated as moderators. This  study consisted of 196 mother-child dyads recruited at delivery from local area  hospitals (107 PCE, 89 non-PCE) and assessed at seven time points across the  toddler to preschool periods. Results revealed no direct associations between  PCE and externalizing behavior problem trajectories. However, results did  indicate that PCE shared a significant indirect relationship with externalizing  behavior problem trajectories via higher levels of maternal negative affect. The  association between PCE and externalizing problem trajectories was also  moderated by caregiving environmental risk such that PCE children in high-risk  caregiving environments did not experience the well-documented normative decline  in externalizing behavior problems beginning at around 3 years of age. This  study suggests potential pathways to externalizing behavior problems among  high-risk children.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414000091 PMCID: PMC3981877 PMID: 24622033 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Oxytocin receptor gene polymorphism, perceived social support, and psychological  symptoms in maltreated adolescents.	Hostinar CE(1), Cicchetti D(1), Rogosch FA(2).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development. (2)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	Despite the detrimental consequences of child maltreatment on developmental  processes, some individuals show remarkable resilience, with few signs of  psychopathology, while others succumb to dysfunction. Given that oxytocin has  been shown to be involved in social affiliation, attachment, social support,  trust, empathy, and other social or reproductive behaviors, we chose to examine  the possible moderation of maltreatment effects on perceived social support and  on psychological symptoms by a common single nucleotide polymorphism (rs53576)  in the oxytocin receptor gene. We studied adolescents (N = 425) aged  approximately 13-15, including participants with objectively documented  maltreatment histories (N = 263) and a nonmaltreated comparison group from a  comparable low socioeconomic status background (N = 162). There was a  significant genotype by maltreatment interaction, such that maltreated  adolescents with the G/G genotype perceived significantly lower social support  compared to maltreated A-carriers, with no effect of genotype in the comparison  group. Maltreated G/Gs also reported higher levels of internalizing symptoms  than did A-carriers, even though they did not differ from them on objective  measures of maltreatment (type, duration, or severity). G/G homozygotes may be  more attuned to negative social experiences, such as family maltreatment, while  maltreated A-carriers were indistinguishable from nonmaltreated adolescents in  levels of mental health symptoms.

Contributions of magnetic resonance spectroscopy to understanding development:  potential applications in the study of adolescent alcohol use and abuse.	Cohen-Gilbert JE(1), Jensen JE(2), Silveri MM(1).	Author information: (1)Neurodevelopmental Laboratory on Addictions and Mental Health. (2)McLean Hospital.	A growing body of research has documented structural and functional brain  development during adolescence, yet little is known about neurochemical changes  that occur during this important developmental period. Magnetic resonance  spectroscopy (MRS) is a well-developed technology that permits the in vivo  quantification of multiple brain neurochemicals relevant to neuronal health and  functioning. However, MRS technology has been underused in exploring normative  developmental changes during adolescence and the onset of alcohol and drug use  and abuse during this developmental period. This review begins with a brief  overview of normative cognitive and neurobiological development during  adolescence, followed by an introduction to MRS principles. The subsequent  sections provide a comprehensive review of the existing MRS studies of  development and cognitive functioning in healthy children and adolescents. The  final sections of this article address the potential application of MRS in  identifying neurochemical predictors and consequences of alcohol use and abuse  in adolescence. MRS studies of adolescent populations hold promise for advancing  our understanding of neurobiological risk factors for psychopathology by  identifying the biochemical signatures associated with healthy brain  development, as well as neurobiological and cognitive correlates of alcohol and  substance use and abuse.

(3)Michigan State University. (4)Brown University Warren Alpert Medical School. (5)VA San Diego Healthcare System.	Emotion knowledge in childhood has been shown to predict social functioning and  psychological well-being, but relatively little is known about parental factors  that influence its development in early childhood. There is some evidence that  both parenting behavior and maternal depression are associated with emotion  recognition, but previous research has only examined these factors  independently. The current study assessed auditory and visual emotion  recognition ability among a large sample of preschool children to examine  typical emotion recognition skills in children of this age, as well as the  independent and interactive effects of maternal and paternal depression and  negative parenting (i.e., hostility and intrusiveness). Results indicated that  children were most accurate at identifying happy emotional expressions. The  lowest accuracy was observed for neutral expressions. A significant interaction  was found between maternal depression and negative parenting behavior: children  with a maternal history of depression were particularly sensitive to the  negative effects of maladaptive parenting behavior on emotion recognition  ability. No significant effects were found for paternal depression. These  results highlight the importance of examining the effects of multiple  interacting factors on children's emotional development and provide suggestions  for identifying children for targeted preventive interventions.

Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University. (2)University of Oregon.	Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2016 Nov;28(4pt2):1565.	This study examined contextual factors (caregiver depression, family resources,  ethnicity, and initial levels of youth problem behavior) related to the  effectiveness of the Family Check-Up (FCU) and evaluated family processes as a  mediator of FCU intervention response and adolescent antisocial behavior. We  followed a sample of 180 ethnically diverse youths of families who engaged in  the FCU intervention. Family data were collected as part of the FCU assessment,  and youth data were collected over 4 years, from sixth through ninth grade.  Findings indicated that caregiver depression and minority status predicted  greater caregiver motivation to change. In turn, caregiver motivation was the  only direct predictor of FCU intervention response during a 1-year period.  Growth in family conflict from sixth through eighth grade mediated the link  between FCU response and ninth-grade antisocial behavior. This study explicitly  tested core aspects of the FCU intervention model and demonstrated that  caregiver motivation is a central factor that underlies family response to the  FCU. The study also provided support for continued examination of family process  mechanisms that account for enduring effects of the FCU and other  family-centered interventions.

Author information: (1)National Institute of Mental Health.	Chronic, severe irritability is common in childhood and is very impairing.  Furthermore, childhood irritability predicts suicidality, social impairment, and  depressive and anxiety disorders in adulthood. Focusing on both normative and  pathologic development, we review the construct of irritability from its origins  in aggression and disruptive behavior research to its contemporary relevance for  affective psychopathology. We then describe two broad neurocognitive systems  that show promise in differentiating irritable from nonirritable youths:  aberrant processing of emotional stimuli and impaired context-sensitive  regulation. We suggest behavioral, neurocognitive, and physiologic measures that  may aid in studying severe irritability and assessing its therapeutics. Finally,  we argue for therapeutic trials targeting severe irritability that address  emotional aspects of irritability in addition to the associated disruptive  behavior.

Dawson G(1), Bernier R(2).	Author information: (1)Duke University. (2)University of Washington, Seattle.	The last 25 years have witnessed tremendous changes in our ability to detect  autism very early in life and provide interventions that can significantly  influence children's outcomes. It was once questioned whether autism could be  recognized before children had developed language and symbolic play skills; now  changes in early behaviors, as well as structural brain changes, have been  documented in infants 6-12 months of age who later develop autism. Advances in  brain imaging and genetics offer the possibility of detecting autism before the  syndrome is fully manifest, thereby reducing or preventing symptoms from  developing. Whereas the primary mode of behavioral intervention a few decades  ago relied on operant conditioning, recent approaches integrate the methods of  applied behavioral analysis within a developmental, relationship-focused  intervention model that are implemented by both parents and clinicians. These  interventions have been found to have positive effects on children's  developmental trajectory, as measured by both behavioral and neurophysiological  assessments. Future approaches will likely combine both behavioral and  pharmacological treatments for children who have less robust responses to  behavioral interventions. There has been a paradigm shift in the way that autism  is viewed, evolving from a lifelong condition with a very poor prognosis to one  in which significant gains and neuroplasticity is expected, especially when the  condition is detected early and appropriate interventions are provided. The  grand challenge for the future is to bridge the tremendous gap between research  and the implementation of evidence-based practices in the broader community,  both in the United States and worldwide. Significant disparities in access to  appropriate health care for children with autism exist that urgently require  advocacy and more resources.

Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development.	In this paper, I propose a roadmap for the integration of culture in  developmental psychopathology. This integration is pressing because culture  continues to be somewhat disconnected from theory, research, training, and  interventions in developmental psychopathology, thus limiting our understanding  of the epigenesis of mental health. I argue that in order to successfully  integrate culture into developmental psychopathology, it is crucial to (a) study  cultural development, (b) consider both individual-level and social-level  cultural processes, (c) examine the interplay between culture and biology, and  (d) promote improved and direct cultural assessment. I provide evidence in  support of each of these guidelines, present alternative conceptual frameworks,  and suggest new lines of research. Hopefully, that these directions will  contribute to the emerging field of cultural development and psychopathology,  which focuses on the elucidation of the cultural processes that initiate,  maintain, or derail trajectories of normal and abnormal behavior.

Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development.	Research on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis has emerged as  a vital area within the field of developmental psychopathology in the past 25  years. Extensive animal research has provided knowledge of the substrates and  physiological mechanisms that guide development of stress reactivity and  regulation using methods that are not feasible in humans. Recent advances in  understanding the anatomy and physiology of the HPA axis in humans and its  interactions with other stress-mediating systems, including accurate assessment  of salivary cortisol, more sophisticated neuroimaging methods, and a variety of  genetic analyses, have led to greater knowledge of how psychological and  biological processes impact functioning. A growing body of research on HPA axis  regulation and reactivity in relation to psychopathology has drawn increased  focus on the prenatal period, infancy, and the pubertal transition as  potentially sensitive periods of stress system development in children. Theories  such as the allostatic load model have guided research by integrating multiple  physiological systems and mechanisms by which stress can affect mental and  physical health. However, almost none of the prominent theoretical models in  stress physiology are truly developmental, and future work must incorporate how  systems interact with the environment across the life span in normal and  atypical development. Our theoretical advancement will depend on our ability to  integrate biological and psychological models. Researchers are increasingly  realizing the importance of communication across disciplinary boundaries in  order to understand how experiences influence neurobehavioral development. It is  important that knowledge gained over the past 25 years has been translated to  prevention and treatment interventions, and we look forward to the dissemination  of interventions that promote recovery from adversity.

Roth TL(1).	Author information: (1)University of Delaware.	In the past decade, there have been exciting advances in the field of behavioral  epigenetics that have provided new insights into a biological basis of neural  and behavioral effects of gene-environment interactions. It is now understood  that changes in the activity of genes established through epigenetic alterations  occur as a consequence of exposure to environmental adversity, social stress,  and traumatic experiences. DNA methylation in particular has thus emerged as a  leading candidate biological pathway linking gene-environment interactions to  long-term and even multigenerational trajectories in behavioral development,  including the vulnerability and resilience to psychopathology. This paper  discusses what we have learned from research using animal models and from  studies in which the translation of these findings has been made to humans.  Studies concerning the significance of DNA methylation alterations in outcomes  associated with stress exposure later in life and dysfunction in the form of  neuropsychiatric disorders are highlighted, and several avenues of future  research are suggested that promise to advance our understanding of epigenetics  both as a mechanism by which the environment can contribute to the development  of psychiatric disorders and as an avenue for more effective intervention and  treatment strategies.

Author information: (1)University of Minnesota.	Progress in the field of developmental psychopathology is appraised in general  and with regard to the particular lens of our understanding of the development  of disorder. In general, the outpouring of research on various features of  disorder and underlying processes could not have even been imagined 25 years  ago. The progress is dazzling. At the same time, work on the development of  disorders, beginning with antecedent patterns of adaptation, pales in comparison  with work on the correlates of disorder. However, progress has been made. It is  well established that the brain develops in the context of experience and that  organism and environment continually interact over time. Something is now known  about pathways leading to certain disorders and what initiates and impels  individuals along them. If developmental psychopathology is to completely  fulfill its promise of offering new ways of conceptualizing disorder and new  guidance for prevention and intervention, much more work on developmental  processes and a new way of exploring the development of disorder will be needed.  Such a path is suggested.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579413000576 PMID: 24342836 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Development of autobiographical memory in children with autism spectrum  disorders: deficits, gains, and predictors of performance.	Goddard L(1), Dritschel B(2), Robinson S(3), Howlin P(3).	Author information: (1)University of London, London. (2)University of St. Andrews, London. (3)Kings College, London.	Autobiographical memory (AM) was assessed in 63 children (aged 8-17 years) with  an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and compared with 63 typically developing  children matched for age, gender, IQ, and verbal ability. A range of  methodologies was employed for eliciting past experience with particular focus  on the ability to recall (a) specific events, (b) the recent and remote past,  and (c) semantic versus episodic memories across different lifetime periods.  Results indicated that the ASD group manifested difficulties in retrieving  specific memories to word cues and had poorer access to the remote past.  Deficits were found in the context of intact recent memory and preserved general  memory abilities, with some impairment of visual memory. Problems in retrieving  episodic and semantic AMs across the life span were also evident. Qualitative  analysis of memory reports suggested that the ASD group was less likely to refer  to emotion in their remote memories but more likely to describe emotions in  their recent memories. Important predictors of AM performance in the ASD group  were central executive abilities, in particular cognitive flexibility and verbal  fluency.

Mustanski B(1), Byck GR, Dymnicki A, Sterrett E, Henry D, Bolland J.	Author information: (1)Northwestern University.	This study examined interdependent trajectories of sexual risk, substance use,  and conduct problems among 12- to 18-year-old African American youths who were  followed annually as part of the Mobile Youth Study. We used growth mixture  modeling to model the development of these three outcomes in the 1,406  participants who met the inclusion criteria. Results indicate that there were  four distinct classes: normative, low risk (74.3% of sample); increasing  high-risk takers (11.9%); adolescent-limited conduct problems and drug risk with  high risky sex (8.0%); and early experimenters (5.8%) The higher risk classes  had higher rates of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections diagnoses than  the normative sample at each of the ages we examined. Differing somewhat from  our hypothesis, all of the nonnormative classes exhibited high sexual risk  behavior. Although prevention efforts should be focused on addressing all three  risk behaviors, the high rate of risky sexual behavior in the 25% of the sample  that fall into the three nonnormative classes underscores an urgent need for  improved sex education, including teen pregnancy and HIV/sexually transmitted  infections prevention, in this community.

Toth SL(1), Rogosch FA, Oshri A, Gravener-Davis J, Sturm R, Morgan-López AA.	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester.	A randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of  interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for ethnically and racially diverse,  economically disadvantaged women with major depressive disorder.  Non-treatment-seeking urban women (N = 128; M age = 25.40, SD = 4.98) with  infants were recruited from the community. Participants were at or below the  poverty level: 59.4% were Black and 21.1% were Hispanic. Women were screened for  depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale;  the Diagnostic Interview Schedule was used to confirm major depressive disorder  diagnosis. Participants were randomized to individual IPT or enhanced community  standard. Depressive symptoms were assessed before, after, and 8 months  posttreatment with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Revised Hamilton  Rating Scale for Depression. The Social Support Behaviors Scale, the Social  Adjustment Scale-Self-Report, and the Perceived Stress Scale were administered  to examine mediators of outcome at follow-up. Treatment effects were evaluated  with a growth mixture model for randomized trials using complier-average causal  effect estimation.

Exposure to maternal pre- and postnatal depression and anxiety symptoms: risk  for major depression, anxiety disorders, and conduct disorder in adolescent  offspring.	Glasheen C(1), Richardson GA, Kim KH, Larkby CA, Swartz HA, Day NL.	Author information: (1)RTI International.	This study evaluated whether exposure to maternal pre- or postnatal depression  or anxiety symptoms predicted psychopathology in adolescent offspring. Growth  mixture modeling was used to identify trajectories of pre- and postnatal  depression and anxiety symptoms in 577 women of low socioeconomic status  selected from a prenatal clinic. Logistic regression models indicated that  maternal pre- and postnatal depression trajectory exposure was not associated  with offspring major depression, anxiety, or conduct disorder, but exposure to  the high depression trajectory was associated with lower anxiety symptoms in  males. Exposure to medium and high pre- and postnatal anxiety was associated  with the risk of conduct disorder among offspring. Male offspring exposed to  medium and high pre- and postnatal anxiety had higher odds of conduct disorder  than did males with low exposure levels. Females exposed to medium or high pre-  and postnatal anxiety were less likely to meet conduct disorder criteria than  were females with lower exposure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the  first study to examine the effect of pre- and postnatal anxiety trajectories on  the risk of conduct disorder in offspring. These results suggest new directions  for investigating the etiology of conduct disorder with a novel target for  intervention.

Interaction matters: quantifying conduct problem × depressive symptoms  interaction and its association with adolescent alcohol, cigarette, and  marijuana use in a national sample.	Maslowsky J(1), Schulenberg JE.	Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin, Madison.	Substance use is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality among American  adolescents. Conduct problems and depressive symptoms have each been found to be  associated with adolescent substance use. Although they are highly comorbid, the  role of the interaction of conduct problems and depressive symptoms in substance  use is not clear. In national samples of 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students  from the Monitoring the Future study, latent moderated structural equation  modeling was used to estimate the association of conduct problems, depressive  symptoms, and their interaction to the use of alcohol (including binge  drinking), cigarettes, and marijuana. Moderation by age and sex was tested. The  interaction of conduct problems with depressive symptoms was a strong predictor  of substance use, particularly among younger adolescents. With few exceptions,  adolescents with high levels of both conduct problems and depressive symptoms  used substances most frequently. Conduct problems were a strong positive  predictor of substance use, and depressive symptoms were a weak positive  predictor. Whereas conduct problems are often thought to be a primary predictor  of substance use, this study revealed that depressive symptoms potentiate the  relation of conduct problems to substance use. Therefore, substance use  prevention efforts should target both depressive symptoms and conduct problems.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579413000357 PMCID: PMC3831176 PMID: 24229547 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Bruce J(1), Fisher PA, Graham AM, Moore WE, Peake SJ, Mannering AM.	Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center.	Children in foster care have often encountered a range of adverse experiences,  including neglectful and/or abusive care and multiple caregiver transitions.  Prior research findings suggest that such experiences negatively affect  inhibitory control and the underlying neural circuitry. In the current study,  event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was employed during a go/no  go task that assesses inhibitory control to compare the behavioral performance  and brain activation of foster children and nonmaltreated children. The sample  included two groups of 9- to 12-year-old children: 11 maltreated foster children  and 11 nonmaltreated children living with their biological parents. There were  no significant group differences on behavioral performance on the task. In  contrast, patterns of brain activation differed by group. The nonmaltreated  children demonstrated stronger activation than did the foster children across  several regions, including the right anterior cingulate cortex, the middle  frontal gyrus, and the right lingual gyrus, during correct no go trials, whereas  the foster children displayed stronger activation than the nonmaltreated  children in the left inferior parietal lobule and the right superior occipital  cortex, including the lingual gyrus and cuneus, during incorrect no go trials.  These results provide preliminary evidence that the early adversity experienced  by foster children impacts the neural substrates of inhibitory control.

Origins of children's externalizing behavior problems in low-income families:  toddlers' willing stance toward their mothers as the missing link.	Kochanska G(1), Kim S, Boldt LJ.	Author information: (1)University of Iowa.	Although children's active role in socialization has been long acknowledged,  relevant research has typically focused on children's difficult temperament or  negative behaviors that elicit coercive and adversarial processes, largely  overlooking their capacity to act as positive, willing, even enthusiastic,  active socialization agents. We studied the willing, receptive stance toward  their mothers in a low-income sample of 186 children who were 24 to 44 months  old. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a latent construct of willing  stance, manifested as children's responsiveness to mothers in naturalistic  interactions, responsive imitation in teaching contexts, and committed  compliance with maternal prohibitions, all observed in the laboratory.  Structural equation modeling analyses confirmed that ecological adversity  undermined maternal responsiveness, and responsiveness, in turn, was linked to  children's willing stance. A compromised willing stance predicted externalizing  behavior problems, assessed 10 months later, and fully mediated the links  between maternal responsiveness and those outcomes. Ecological adversity had a  direct, unmediated effect on internalizing behavior problems. Considering  children's active role as willing, receptive agents capable of embracing  parental influence can lead to a more complete understanding of detrimental  mechanisms that link ecological adversity with antisocial developmental  pathways. It can also inform research on the normative socialization process,  consistent with the objectives of developmental psychopathology.

Ganzel BL(1), Kim P, Gilmore H, Tottenham N, Temple E.	Author information: (1)Cornell University.	Little is known about the long-term neural consequences of adverse life events  for healthy adolescents, and this is particularly the case for events that occur  after a putative stress-sensitive period in early childhood. In this functional  magnetic resonance imaging study of healthy adolescents, we found that prior  exposure to severe adverse life events was associated with current anxiety and  with increased amygdala reactivity to standardized emotional stimuli (viewing of  fearful faces relative to calm ones). Conjunction analyses identified multiple  regions, including the amygdala, insula, and prefrontal cortex, in which  reactivity to emotional faces covaried with life events as well as with current  anxiety. Our morphometric analyses suggest systemic alterations in structural  brain development with an association between anxiety symptoms and global gray  matter volume. No life events were reported for the period before 4 years of  age, suggesting that these results were not driven by exposure to stress during  an early sensitive period in development. Overall, these data suggest systemic  effects of traumatic events on the dynamically developing brain that are present  even in a nonclinical sample of adolescents.

Precursors of adolescent substance use from early childhood and early  adolescence: testing a developmental cascade model.	Sitnick SL(1), Shaw DS(1), Hyde LW(1).	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh.	This study examined developmentally salient risk and protective factors of  adolescent substance use assessed during early childhood and early adolescence  using a sample of 310 low-income boys. Child problem behavior and proximal  family risk and protective factors (i.e., parenting and maternal depression)  during early childhood, as well as child and family factors and peer deviant  behavior during adolescence, were explored as potential precursors to later  substance use during adolescence using structural equation modeling. Results  revealed that early childhood risk and protective factors (i.e., child  externalizing problems, mothers' depressive symptomatology, and nurturant  parenting) were indirectly related to substance use at the age of 17 via risk  and protective factors during early and middle adolescence (i.e., parental  knowledge and externalizing problems). The implications of these findings for  early prevention and intervention are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579413000539 PMCID: PMC3864122 PMID: 24029248 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.  Marc_H_Bornstein@nih.gov	Two independent prospective longitudinal studies that cumulatively spanned the  age interval from 4 years to 14 years used multiwave designs to investigate  developmental associations between language and behavioral adjustment  (internalizing and externalizing behavior problems). Altogether 224 children,  their mothers, and teachers provided data. Series of nested path analysis models  were used to determine the most parsimonious and plausible paths among the three  constructs over and above stability in each across age and their covariation at  each age. In both studies, children with poorer language skills in early  childhood had more internalizing behavior problems in later childhood and in  early adolescence. These developmental paths between language and behavioral  adjustment held after taking into consideration children's nonverbal  intellectual functioning, maternal verbal intelligence, education, parenting  knowledge, and social desirability bias, as well as family socioeconomic status,  and they applied equally to girls and boys.

Escaping the snare of chronological growth and launching a free curve  alternative: general deviance as latent growth model.	Wood PK(1), Jackson KM.	Author information: (1)University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA. woodph@missouri.edu	Researchers studying longitudinal relationships among multiple problem behaviors  sometimes characterize autoregressive relationships across constructs as  indicating "protective" or "launch" factors or as "developmental snares." These  terms are used to indicate that initial or intermediary states of one problem  behavior subsequently inhibit or promote some other problem behavior. Such  models are contrasted with models of "general deviance" over time in which all  problem behaviors are viewed as indicators of a common linear trajectory. When  fit of the "general deviance" model is poor and fit of one or more  autoregressive models is good, this is taken as support for the inhibitory or  enhancing effect of one construct on another. In this paper, we argue that  researchers consider competing models of growth before comparing deviance and  time-bound models. Specifically, we propose use of the free curve slope  intercept (FCSI) growth model (Meredith & Tisak, 1990) as a general model to  typify change in a construct over time. The FCSI model includes, as nested  special cases, several statistical models often used for prospective data, such  as linear slope intercept models, repeated measures multivariate analysis of  variance, various one-factor models, and hierarchical linear models. When  considering models involving multiple constructs, we argue the construct of  "general deviance" can be expressed as a single-trait multimethod model,  permitting a characterization of the deviance construct over time without  requiring restrictive assumptions about the form of growth over time. As an  example, prospective assessments of problem behaviors from the Dunedin  Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (Silva & Stanton, 1996) are  considered and contrasted with earlier analyses of Hussong, Curran, Moffitt, and  Caspi (2008), which supported launch and snare hypotheses. For antisocial  behavior, the FCSI model fit better than other models, including the linear  chronometric growth curve model used by Hussong et al. For models including  multiple constructs, a general deviance model involving a single trait and  multimethod factors (or a corresponding hierarchical factor model) fit the data  better than either the "snares" alternatives or the general deviance model  previously considered by Hussong et al. Taken together, the analyses support the  view that linkages and turning points cannot be contrasted with general deviance  models absent additional experimental intervention or control.

Weems CF(1), Scott BG, Taylor LK, Cannon MF, Romano DM, Perry AM.	Author information: (1)University of New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, USA. cweems@uno.edu	This study tested a theoretical model of continuity in anxious emotion and its  links to academic achievement in disaster-exposed youth. An urban school based  sample of youths (n = 191; Grades 4-8) exposed to Hurricane Katrina were  assessed at 24 months (Time 1) and then again at 30 months (Time 2)  postdisaster. Academic achievement was assessed through end of the school year  standardized test scores (~31 months after Katrina). The results suggest that  the association of traumatic stress to academic achievement was indirect via  linkages from earlier (Time 1) posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms that  predicted later (Time 2) test anxiety. Time 2 test anxiety was then negatively  associated with academic achievement. Age and gender invariance testing  suggested strong consistency across gender and minor developmental variation in  the age range examined. The model presented advances the developmental  understanding of the expression of anxious emotion and its links to student  achievement among disaster-exposed urban school children. The findings highlight  the importance of identifying heterotypic continuity in anxiety and suggest  potential applied and policy directions for disaster-exposed youth. Avenues for  future theoretical refinement are also discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579413000138 PMID: 23880388 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Effects of family cohesion and heart rate reactivity on aggressive/rule-breaking  behavior and prosocial behavior in adolescence: the Tracking Adolescents'  Individual Lives Survey study.	Sijtsema JJ(1), Nederhof E, Veenstra R, Ormel J, Oldehinkel AJ, Ellis BJ.	Author information: (1)University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. j.j.sijtsema@rug.nl	The biological sensitivity to context hypothesis posits that high physiological  reactivity (i.e., increases in arousal from baseline) constitutes heightened  sensitivity to environmental influences, for better or worse. To test this  hypothesis, we examined the interactive effects of family cohesion and heart  rate reactivity to a public speaking task on aggressive/rule-breaking and  prosocial behavior in a large sample of adolescents (N = 679; M age = 16.14).  Multivariate analyses revealed small- to medium-sized main effects of lower  family cohesion and lower heart rate reactivity on higher levels of  aggressive/rule-breaking and lower levels of prosocial behavior. Although there  was some evidence of three-way interactions among family cohesion, heart rate  reactivity, and sex in predicting these outcome variables, these interactions  were not in the direction predicted by the biological sensitivity to context  hypothesis. Instead, heightened reactivity appeared to operate as a protective  factor against family adversity, rather than as a susceptibility factor. The  results of the present study raise the possibility that stress reactivity may no  longer operate as a mechanism of differential susceptibility in adolescence.

Kouros CD(1), Quasem S, Garber J.	Author information: (1)Vanderbilt University. ckouros@smu.edu	Symptoms of anxiety and depression are prevalent among adolescents and  associated with impairment in multiple domains of functioning. Moreover, anxiety  and depression frequently co-occur, with estimated comorbidity rates as high as  75%. Whereas previous research has shown that anxiety symptoms predict increased  depressive symptoms over time, the relation between depressive symptoms and  later anxiety symptoms has been inconsistent. The present study examined dynamic  relations between anxiety and depressive symptoms across adolescence and  explored whether these longitudinal relations were moderated by maternal history  of anxiety, family relationship quality, or children's attributional style.  Participants included 240 children (M age = 11.86 years; 53.9% female) and their  mothers, who were assessed annually for 6 years. Children reported on their  depressive symptoms and mothers reported on their child's anxiety symptoms.  Dynamic latent change score models indicated that anxiety symptoms predicted  subsequent elevations in depressive symptoms over time. Depressive symptoms  predicted subsequent elevations in anxiety symptoms among children who had  mothers with a history of anxiety, reported low family relationship quality, or  had high levels of negative attributions. Thus, whereas anxiety symptoms were a  robust predictor of later depressive symptoms during adolescence, contextual and  individual factors may be important to consider when examining relations between  depressive symptoms and subsequent change in anxiety symptoms.

De Los Reyes A(1).	Author information: (1)University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, USA. adlr@umd.edu	Developmental psychopathology researchers and practitioners commonly conduct  behavioral assessments using multiple informants' reports (e.g., parents,  teachers, practitioners, children, and laboratory observers). These assessments  often yield inconsistent conclusions about important questions in developmental  psychopathology research, depending on the informant (e.g., psychiatric  diagnoses and risk factors of disorder). Researchers have theorized why  informant discrepancies exist and advanced methodological models of informant  discrepancies. However, over 50 years of empirical data has uncovered little  knowledge about these discrepancies beyond that they exist, complicate  interpretations of research findings and assessment outcomes in practice, and  correlate with some characteristics of the informants providing reports (e.g.,  demographics and mood levels). Further, recent studies often yield take-home  messages about the importance of taking a multi-informant approach to clinical  and developmental assessments. Researchers draw these conclusions from their  work, despite multi-informant approaches to assessment long being a part of best  practices in clinical and developmental assessments. Consequently, developmental  psychopathology researchers and practitioners are in dire need of a focused set  of research priorities with the key goal of rapidly advancing knowledge about  informant discrepancies. In this paper, I discuss these research priorities,  review work indicating the feasibility of conducting research addressing these  priorities, and specify what researchers and practitioners would gain from  studies advancing knowledge about informant discrepancies in developmental  psychopathology research.

The serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region and brain-derived  neurotrophic factor valine to methionine at position 66 polymorphisms and  maternal history of depression: associations with cognitive vulnerability to  depression in childhood.	Hayden EP(1), Olino TM, Bufferd SJ, Miller A, Dougherty LR, Sheikh HI, Singh SM,  Klein DN.	Author information: (1)University of Western Ontario, Canada. ehayden@uwo.ca	Preliminary work indicates that cognitive vulnerability to depression may be  associated with variants of the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism  (5-HTTLPR) and the valine to methionine at position 66 (val66met) polymorphism  of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene; however, existing reports  come from small samples. The present study sought to replicate and extend this  research in a sample of 375 community-dwelling children and their parents.  Following a negative mood induction, children completed a self-referent encoding  task tapping memory for positive and negative self-descriptive traits.  Consistent with previous work, we found that children with at least one short  variant of the 5-HTTLPR had enhanced memory for negative self-descriptive  traits. The BDNF val66met polymorphism had no main effect but was moderated by  maternal depression, such that children with a BDNF methionine allele had a  heightened memory for negative self-descriptive traits when mothers had  experienced depression during children's lifetimes; in contrast, children with a  methionine allele had low recall of negative traits when mothers had no  depression history. The findings provide further support for the notion that the  5-HTTLPR is associated with cognitive markers of depression vulnerability and  that the BDNF methionine allele moderates children's sensitivity to contextual  factors.

Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, USA. herbe064@umn.edu	School mobility has been shown to increase the risk of poor achievement,  behavior problems, grade retention, and high school dropout. Using data over 25  years from the Chicago Longitudinal Study, we investigated the unique risk of  school moves on a variety of young adult outcomes including educational  attainment, occupational prestige, depression symptoms, and criminal arrests. We  also investigated how the timing of school mobility, whether earlier or later in  the academic career, may differentially predict these outcomes over and above  associated risks. Results indicate that students who experience more school  changes between kindergarten and 12th grade are less likely to complete high  school on time, complete fewer years of school, attain lower levels of  occupational prestige, experience more symptoms of depression, and are more  likely to be arrested as adults. Furthermore, the number of school moves  predicted outcomes above and beyond associated risks such as residential  mobility and family poverty. When timing of school mobility was examined,  results indicated more negative outcomes associated with moves later in the  grade school career, particularly between 4th and 8th grades.

Interactive contributions of self-regulation deficits and social motivation to  psychopathology: unraveling divergent pathways to aggressive behavior and  depressive symptoms.	Rudolph KD(1), Troop-Gordon W, Llewellyn N.	Author information: (1)University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL 61820, USA.  krudolph@illinois.edu	Poor self-regulation has been implicated as a significant risk factor for the  development of multiple forms of psychopathology. This research examined the  proposition that self-regulation deficits differentially predict aggressive  behavior and depressive symptoms, depending on children's social approach versus  avoidance motivation. A prospective, multiple-informant approach was used to  test this hypothesis in 419 children (M age = 8.92, SD = 0.36). Parents rated  children's inhibitory control. Children completed measures of social  approach-avoidance motivation and depressive symptoms. Teachers rated children's  aggressive behavior. As anticipated, poor inhibitory control predicted  aggressive behavior in boys with high but not low approach motivation and low  but not high avoidance motivation, whereas poor inhibitory control predicted  depressive symptoms in girls with high but not low avoidance motivation. This  research supports several complementary theoretical models of psychopathology  and provides insight into the differential contributions of poor self-regulation  to maladaptive developmental outcomes. The findings suggest the need for  targeted intervention programs that consider heterogeneity among children with  self-regulatory deficits.

Crockett LJ(1), Carlo G, Wolff JM, Hope MO.	Author information: (1)University of Nebraska-Lincoln, NE 68588-0308, USA. ecrockett1@unl.edu	This longitudinal study examined the joint role of pubertal timing and  temperament variables (emotional reactivity and self-regulation) in predicting  adolescents' internalizing symptoms. The multiethnic sample included 1,025  adolescent girls and boys followed from age 11 to age 15 (M age = 11.03 years at  Time 1). In structural equation models, age 11 measures of pubertal timing,  emotional reactivity, and self-regulation and their interactions were used to  predict adolescents' internalizing behavior concurrently and at age 15. Results  indicated that, among girls, early pubertal timing, higher emotional reactivity,  and lower self-regulation predicted increased internalizing behavior. In  addition, self-regulation moderated the effect of pubertal timing such that  effects of earlier timing on subsequent internalizing were seen primarily among  girls with relatively poor self-regulation. Among boys, higher levels of  emotional reactivity and lower self-regulation predicted increased  internalizing, but there were no effects of pubertal timing. After controlling  for Time 1 internalizing symptoms, only self-regulation predicted change in  internalizing symptoms. Discussion focuses on the possible interplay of  temperament and pubertal development in predicting internalizing problems during  adolescence.

Gene-environment interaction between dopamine receptor D4 7-repeat polymorphism  and early maternal sensitivity predicts inattention trajectories across middle  childhood.	Berry D(1), Deater-Deckard K, McCartney K, Wang Z, Petrill SA.	Author information: (1)University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 61820, USA. djberry@illinois.edu	Evidence suggests that the 7-repeat variant of a 48 base pair variable number  tandem repeat polymorphism in the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene may be  associated with the development of attention problems. A parallel literature  suggests that genes linked to dopaminergic functioning may be associated with  differential sensitivity to context, such that the direction of the genetic  effect is hypothesized to vary across environmental experience. Guided by these  literatures, we used data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth  Development to consider (a) whether individual differences in children's  inattention problems across middle childhood are predicted by gene-environment  interactions between the DRD4 gene 7-repeat polymorphism and children's  experiences of maternal sensitivity across infancy and early childhood and (b)  the degree to which such interactions are consistent with the  differential-sensitivity model. Largely consistent with the hypothesized model,  gene-environment interactions indicated that, in the context of insensitive  early maternal care, the DRD4 7-repeat polymorphism was associated with higher  levels of inattention. Although somewhat less consistently, there was also  evidence that, in the context of highly sensitive care, the 7-repeat  polymorphism was associated with lower levels of inattention. Overall, the  magnitude of the absolute genetic effect increased over time, as children's  inattention trajectories diverged.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941200106X PMID: 23627945 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Hierarchical linear  modeling was used in this prospective, longitudinal study (n = 297 families) to  assess changes in the dimensions of responding to conflict (i.e., emotional,  cognitive, and behavioral) for 3 consecutive years in youths between the ages of  8 and 19 years. Moreover, to test the notion of sensitization, analyses were  conducted to examine whether change in marital conflict predicted change in  children's responding across middle childhood and adolescence. Supporting the  sensitization hypothesis, increases in exposure to hostile marital conflict were  associated with increases in children's negative emotionality, threat,  self-blame, and skepticism about resolution. With a few exceptions, the effects  were largely consistent for boys and girls and for younger and older children.

Childhood temperament: passive gene-environment correlation, gene-environment  interaction, and the hidden importance of the family environment.	Lemery-Chalfant K(1), Kao K, Swann G, Goldsmith HH.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, P.O. Box 871104, Arizona State University, Tempe,  AZ 85287-1104, USA. klemery@asu.edu	Biological parents pass on genotypes to their children, as well as provide home  environments that correlate with their genotypes; thus, the association between  the home environment and children's temperament can be genetically (i.e.,  passive gene-environment correlation) or environmentally mediated. Furthermore,  family environments may suppress or facilitate the heritability of children's  temperament (i.e., gene-environment interaction). The sample comprised 807 twin  pairs (mean age = 7.93 years) from the longitudinal Wisconsin Twin Project.  Important passive gene-environment correlations emerged, such that home  environments were less chaotic for children with high effortful control, and  this association was genetically mediated. Children with high  extraversion/surgency experienced more chaotic home environments, and this  correlation was also genetically mediated. In addition, heritability of  children's temperament was moderated by home environments, such that effortful  control and extraversion/surgency were more heritable in chaotic homes, and  negative affectivity was more heritable under crowded or unsafe home conditions.  Modeling multiple types of gene-environment interplay uncovered the complex role  of genetic factors and the hidden importance of the family environment for  children's temperament and development more generally.

Stevens HE(1), Mariani J, Coppola G, Vaccarino FM.	Author information: (1)Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520–7900, USA.	The recent introduction of the induced pluripotent stem cell technology has made  possible the derivation of neuronal cells from somatic cells obtained from human  individuals. This in turn has opened new areas of investigation that can  potentially bridge the gap between neuroscience and psychopathology. For the  first time we can study the cell biology and genetics of neurons derived from  any individual. Furthermore, by recapitulating in vitro the developmental steps  whereby stem cells give rise to neuronal cells, we can now hope to understand  factors that control typical and atypical development. We can begin to explore  how human genes and their variants are transcribed into messenger RNAs within  developing neurons and how these gene transcripts control the biology of  developing cells. Thus, human-induced pluripotent stem cells have the potential  to uncover not only what aspects of development are uniquely human but also  variations in the series of events necessary for normal human brain development  that predispose to psychopathology.

Childhood adversity and DNA methylation of genes involved in the  hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and immune system: whole-genome and  candidate-gene associations.	Bick J(1), Naumova O, Hunter S, Barbot B, Lee M, Luthar SS, Raefski A,  Grigorenko EL.	Author information: (1)Yale University, New Haven, CT 06519, USA.	In recent years, translational research involving humans and animals has  uncovered biological and physiological pathways that explain associations  between early adverse circumstances and long-term mental and physical health  outcomes. In this article, we summarize the human and animal literature  demonstrating that epigenetic alterations in key biological systems, the  hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and immune system, may underlie such  disparities. We review evidence suggesting that changes in DNA methylation  profiles of the genome may be responsible for the alterations in  hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and immune system trajectories. Using some  preliminary data, we demonstrate how explorations of genome-wide and  candidate-gene DNA methylation profiles may inform hypotheses and guide future  research efforts in these areas. We conclude our article by discussing the many  important future directions, merging perspectives from developmental psychology,  molecular genetics, neuroendocrinology, and immunology, that are essential for  furthering our understanding of how early adverse circumstances may shape  developmental trajectories, particularly in the areas of stress reactivity and  physical or mental health.

The serotonin transporter gene is a substrate for age and stress dependent  epigenetic regulation in rhesus macaque brain: potential roles in genetic  selection and gene × environment interactions.

Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2014 Nov;26(4 Pt 1):1181.	In humans, it has been demonstrated that the serotonin transporter linked  polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genotype moderates risk in the face of adversity.  One mechanism by which stress could interact with genotype is via epigenetic  modifications. We wanted to examine whether stress interacted with genotype to  predict binding of a histone 3 protein trimethylated at lysine 3 (H3K4me3) that  marks active promoters. The brains (N = 61) of male rhesus macaques that had  been reared in the presence or absence of stress were archived and the  hippocampusi dissected. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with an  antibody against H3K4me3 followed by sequencing on a SolexaG2A. The effects of  age, genotype (5-HTTLPR long/long vs. short), and stress exposure (peer-reared  vs. mother-reared) on levels of H3K4me3 binding were determined. We found  effects of age and stress exposure. There was a decline in H3K4me3 from  preadolescence to postadolescence and lower levels in peer-reared monkeys and no  effects of genotype. When we controlled for age, however, we found that there  were effects of 5-HTTLPR genotype and rearing condition on H3K4me3 binding. In a  larger sample, we observed that cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid  levels were subject to interactive effects among age, rearing history, and  genotype. Genes containing both genetic selection and epigenetic regulation may  be particularly important in stress adaptation and development. We find evidence  for selection at the solute carrier family C6 member 4 gene and observe  epigenetic reorganization according to genotype, stress, and age. These data  suggest that developmental stage may moderate effects of stress and serotonin  transporter genotype in the emergence of alternative adaptation strategies and  in the vulnerability to developmental or psychiatric disorders.

Jaffee SR(1), Price TS.	Author information: (1)King's College London, UK. srjaffee@psych.penn.edu	The significance of genotype-environment interplay is its focus on how causal  factors, whether environmental or genetic, have their effects. It is difficult  to establish causality in observational research because of the potential for  reverse causation and confounding. Most environmental measures are heritable,  which means that their effects on the risk for psychopathology are potentially  confounded by genotype. In contrast, genetic influences on psychopathology may  be mediated by their effect on environmental exposures. The existence of genetic  influences on putative environmental risk factors offers both possibilities and  pitfalls for research into environmental epidemiology. We use the example of  parenting and its influence on childhood externalizing problems to review how  genotype-environment correlations can be exploited to demonstrate causal  processes in pyschopathology.

The role of limbic system irritability in linking history of childhood  maltreatment and psychiatric outcomes in low-income, high-risk women: moderation  by FK506 binding protein 5 haplotype.	Dackis MN(1), Rogosch FA, Oshri A, Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)University of Rochester, NY, USA. mdackis@psych.rochester.edu	Childhood maltreatment is associated with lasting changes in neuroendocrine  regulation, alterations in brain structure and function, and symptoms of "limbic  irritability." Limbic irritability symptoms include somatic, sensory, and  behavioral phenomena and may stem from increased excitatory neurotransmission  following maltreatment. We tested the hypotheses that child maltreatment is  indirectly associated with depressive and dissociative symptomatology via  indicators of limbic irritability and that variation within the FK506 binding  protein 5 gene (FKBP5), a gene involved in glucorticoid receptor functioning,  moderates these effects. The sample consisted of high-risk, low-income women (N  = 236) living in an inner-city environment. Child maltreatment, limbic  irritability, and symptoms of depression and dissociation were measured  cross-sectionally using self-report assessments. Haplotype analyses were  conducted across four FKBP5 single nucleotide polymorphisms: rs3800373,  rs9296158, rs1360870, and rs9470080. Path analysis using bootstrapping  procedures was performed to test hypotheses regarding indirect and conditional  indirect effects. We found significant indirect effects of maltreatment on  depression (β = 0.088, p < .01) and dissociation (β = 0.105, p < .01) via limbic  irritability. In addition, variation within FKBP5 moderated these significant  indirect effects. For individuals with one to two copies of the CATT haplotype,  the indirect effects of maltreatment on depression (β = 0.137, p < .01) and  dissociation (β = 0.132, p < .01) via limbic irritability were significant,  whereas the indirect paths were not significant for individuals with no copies  of this haplotype (depression: β = 0.037, p > .05; dissociation: β = 0.002, p >  .05). These results add to the growing evidence that child maltreatment may lead  to symptoms of internalizing psychopathology through its impact on the limbic  system. In addition, this study revealed a potential role of FKBP5 gene variants  in contributing to risk for limbic system dysfunction.

Kurrikoff T(1), Lesch KP, Kiive E, Konstabel K, Herterich S, Veidebaum T, Reif  A, Harro J.	Author information: (1)University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.	A functional promoter polymorphism of the nitric oxide synthase 1 gene first  exon 1f variable number tandem repeat (NOS1 ex1f-VNTR) is associated with  impulsivity and related psychopathology. Facets of impulsivity are strongly  associated with personality traits; maladaptive impulsivity with neuroticism;  and adaptive impulsivity with extraversion. Both high neuroticism and low  extraversion predict anxiety and depressive symptoms. The aim of the present  study was to evaluate the effect of the NOS1 ex1f-VNTR genotype and possible  interaction with environmental factors on personality, anxiety, and  depressiveness in a population-representative sample. Short allele carriers had  higher neuroticism and anxiety than individuals with the long/long (l/l)  genotype. Male short/short homozygotes also had higher extraversion. In the face  of environmental adversity, females with a short allele had higher scores of  neuroticism, anxiety, and depressiveness compared to the l/l genotype. Males  were more sensitive to environmental conditions when they had the l/l genotype  and low extraversion. In conclusion, the NOS1 ex1f-VNTR influences personality  and emotional regulation dependent on gender and environment. Together with  previous findings on the effect of the NOS1 genotype on impulse control, these  data suggest that NOS1 should be considered another plasticity gene, because its  variants are associated with different coping strategies.

Downs Boulevard, MHC 2639,  Tampa, FL 33612, USA. ekimonis@usf.edu	Accumulating research suggests that psychopathy can be disaggregated into  low-anxious primary and high-anxious secondary variants, and this research may  be important for understanding antisocial youths with callous-unemotional  traits. Using model-based cluster analysis, the present study disaggregated 165  serious male adolescent offenders (M age = 16) with high scores on the Youth  Psychopathic Traits Inventory into primary and secondary variants based on the  presence of anxiety. The results indicated that the secondary, high-anxious  variant was more likely to show a history of abuse and scored higher on measures  of emotional and attentional problems. On a picture version of the dot-probe  task, the low-anxious primary variant was not engaged by emotionally distressing  pictures, whereas the high-anxious secondary variant was more attentive to such  stimuli (Cohen d = 0.71). Although the two groups differed as hypothesized from  one another, neither differed significantly in their emotional processing from a  nonpsychopathic control group of offending youth (n = 208). These results are  consistent with the possibility that the two variants of psychopathy, both of  which were high on callous-unemotional traits, may have different etiological  pathways, with the primary being more related to a deficit in the processing of  distress cues in others and the secondary being more related to histories of  abuse and emotional problems.

Granic I(1), Meusel LA, Lamm C, Woltering S, Lewis MD.	Author information: (1)Department of Developmental Psychopathology, Radboud University Nijmegen,  Behavioural Science Institute, Montessorilaan 3, Nijmegen 6525 HR, The  Netherlands. i.granic@pwo.ru.nl	Past studies have shown that aggressive children exhibit rigid (rather than  flexible) parent-child interactions; these rigid repertoires may provide the  context through which children fail to acquire emotion-regulation skills.  Difficulties in regulating emotion are associated with minimal activity in  dorsal systems in the cerebral cortex, for example, the anterior cingulate  cortex. The current study aimed to integrate parent-child and neurocognitive  indices of emotion regulation and examine their associations for the first time.  Sixty children (8-12 years old) referred for treatment for aggression underwent  two assessments. Brain processes related to emotion regulation were assessed  using dense-array EEG with a computerized go/no-go task. The N2 amplitudes  thought to tap inhibitory control were recorded, and a source analysis was  conducted. In the second assessment, parents and children were videotaped while  trying to solve a conflict topic. State space grids were used to derive two  dynamic flexibility parameters from the coded videotapes: (a) the number of  transitions between emotional states and (b) the dispersion of emotional states,  based on proportional durations in each state. The regression results showed  that flexibility measures were not related to N2 amplitudes. However,  flexibility measures were significantly associated with the ratio of dorsal to  ventral source activation: for transitions, ΔR 2 = .27, F (1, 34) = 13.13, p =  .001; for dispersion, ΔR 2 = .29, F (1, 35) = 14.76, p < .001. Thus, in support  of our main hypothesis, greater dyadic flexibility was associated with a higher  ratio of dorsomedial to ventral activation, suggesting that children with more  flexible parent-child interactions are able to recruit relatively more  dorsomedial activity in challenging situations.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Washington State University, PO Box 644820,  Pullman, WA 99164, USA. ted.beauchaine@wsu.edu	During the last quarter century, developmental psychopathology has become  increasingly inclusive and now spans disciplines ranging from psychiatric  genetics to primary prevention. As a result, developmental psychopathologists  have extended traditional diathesis-stress and transactional models to include  causal processes at and across all relevant levels of analysis. Such research is  embodied in what is known as the multiple levels of analysis perspective. We  describe how multiple levels of analysis research has informed our current  thinking about antisocial and borderline personality development among trait  impulsive and therefore vulnerable individuals. Our approach extends the  multiple levels of analysis perspective beyond simple Biology × Environment  interactions by evaluating impulsivity across physiological systems (genetic,  autonomic, hormonal, neural), psychological constructs (social, affective,  motivational), developmental epochs (preschool, middle childhood, adolescence,  adulthood), sexes (male, female), and methods of inquiry (self-report, informant  report, treatment outcome, cardiovascular, electrophysiological, neuroimaging).  By conducting our research using any and all available methods across these  levels of analysis, we have arrived at a developmental model of trait  impulsivity that we believe confers a greater understanding of this highly  heritable trait and captures at least some heterogeneity in key behavioral  outcomes, including delinquency and suicide.

Author information: (1)Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London,  Gower Street, London WC1 6BT, United Kingdom. e.viding@ucl.ac.uk	An overview is provided of recent twin, molecular genetic, and magnetic  resonance imaging studies that are helping to inform a model of developmental  vulnerability to adult psychopathy. Although the current evidence base suggests  that children with high levels of callous-unemotional traits are genetically and  neurocognitively vulnerable to developing psychopathic and antisocial behaviors,  existing research also clearly indicates that environmental influences play an  important role. One potential implication is that interventions for children  with antisocial behavior and callous-unemotional traits may need to be tailored  to take into account their distinct pattern of neurocognitive vulnerability, as  revealed by developmental neuroimaging studies. Specifically, interventions that  pursue punishment-oriented or explicit empathy induction strategies may be less  effective with this group of antisocial children. By contrast, preliminary  evidence suggests that enhancing positive parenting and parental involvement, as  well as applying consistent rewards may represent more promising intervention  approaches.

The present study utilized a multilevel approach to examine developmental  trajectories in risk-taking propensity. We examined the moderating role of  specific executive function components, attention shifting and inhibitory  control, on the link between exuberant temperament in infancy and propensity for  risk taking in childhood. Risk taking was assessed using a task previously  associated with sensation seeking and antisocial behaviors. Two hundred  ninety-one infants were brought into the lab and behaviors reflecting exuberance  were observed at 4, 9, 24, and 36 months of age. Executive function was assessed  at 48 months of age. Risk-taking propensity was measured when children were 60  months of age. The results indicated that exuberance and attention shifting, but  not inhibitory control, significantly interacted to predict propensity for risk  taking. Exuberance was positively associated with risk-taking propensity among  children who were relatively low in attention shifting but unrelated for  children high in attention shifting. These findings illustrated the  multifinality of developmental outcomes for temperamentally exuberant young  children and pointed to the distinct regulatory influences of different  executive functions for children of differing temperaments. Attention shifting  likely affords a child the ability to consider both positive and negative  consequences and moderates the relation between early exuberance and risk-taking  propensity.

Baker E(1), Baibazarova E, Ktistaki G, Shelton KH, van Goozen SH.	Author information: (1)School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Tower Building, Park Place, Cardiff  CF10 3AT, UK.	Extremes in fearful temperament have long been associated with later  psychopathology and risk pathways. Whereas fearful children are inhibited and  anxious and avoid novel events, fearless individuals are disinhibited and more  likely to engage in aggressive behavior. However, very few studies have examined  fear in infants from a multimethod and prospective longitudinal perspective.  This study had the following objectives: to examine behavioral, maternal  reported, and physiological indices of fearful temperament in infancy, together  with their relations and stability over time; and to establish whether early  indices of fear predict fear later in toddlerhood. We also examined the  association between behavioral and physiological measures of fear and guilt and  whether fear in infancy predicts guilt in toddlers. Finally, we investigated  infant risk factors for later psychopathology. We recorded skin conductance  level (SCL) and heart rate (HR) and observed children's responses during a  Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery fear paradigm across the first 3 years  of life and during a guilt induction procedure at age 3 (N = 70). The results  indicate that different measures of infant fear were associated across time.  Observed fearlessness in infancy predicted observed fearlessness and low levels  of SCL arousal to fear and guilt in toddlers. Low levels of HR and SCL to fear  in infancy predicted low levels of physiological arousal to the same situation  and to guilt 2 years later. Fear and guilt were significantly associated across  measures. Finally, toddlers with clinically significant internalizing problems  at age 3 were already notably more fearful in Year 1 as reflected by their  significantly higher HR levels. The results indicated that assessments of  children in infancy are predictive of how these children react 2 years later and  therefore lend support to the idea that the emotional thermostat is set in the  first 3 years of life. They also showed, for the first time, that infant fear is  a predictor of guilt, which is an emotion that develops later. The implications  of these findings for our understanding of developmental psychopathology are  discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412000399 PMID: 22781857 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY, 524 West 59th Street, New York,  NY 10019, USA. pchauhan@jjay.cuny.edu	This paper examined whether childhood maltreatment increases the risk of living  in neighborhoods with less desirable characteristics (i.e., more disorder and  disadvantage, less social cohesion, social control and advantage, and fewer  resources) in middle adulthood and whether these neighborhood characteristics  influence subsequent illicit drug use. Using a prospective cohort design study,  court documented cases of childhood abuse and neglect and matched controls (n =  833) were first interviewed as young adults (mean age = 29 years) from 1989 to  1995 and again in middle adulthood from 2000 to 2002 (mean age = 40 years) and  2003 to 2005 (mean age = 41 years). In middle adulthood, individuals with  histories of childhood abuse and neglect were more likely to live in  neighborhoods with more disorder and disadvantage and less social cohesion and  advantage compared to controls and to engage in illicit drug use during the past  year. Path analyses showed an indirect effect on illicit drug use via  neighborhood disorder among maltreated children, even after accounting for drug  abuse symptoms in young adulthood, although this was sex specific and race  specific, affecting women and Whites. Overall, child abuse and neglect places  children on a negative trajectory that dynamically influences negative outcomes  at multiple levels into middle adulthood.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Loyola University Chicago, 6525 North Sheridan  Road, Chicago, IL 60626, USA. cconley@luc.edu	This research investigated whether exposure to peer stress serves as one pathway  through which pubertal development contributes to depression over time,  differentially for girls and boys. Youth (N = 149; 9.6-14.8 years) and their  caregivers provided information at two waves, 1 year apart, on puberty (Wave 1),  peer stress (occurring between Waves 1 and 2), and depression (Waves 1 and 2).  Structural equation modeling analyses examined sex differences in the extent to  which peer stress mediated the impact of pubertal status and timing on  subsequent depression (i.e., tests of moderated mediation). Significant  sex-moderated mediation was found for both pubertal status and timing. As  indicated by moderate effect proportions, in girls, heightened peer stress  partially mediated the longitudinal association between (a) more advanced  pubertal status and depression; and (b) linear, but not curvilinear, pubertal  timing (i.e., earlier maturation) and depression. This research contributes to  our growing understanding of the interplay among physical, psychological, and  social processes involved in the sex difference in adolescent depression.

Waugh CE(1), Muhtadie L, Thompson RJ, Joormann J, Gotlib IH.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Wake Forest University, WinstonSalem, NC 27109,  USA. waughce@wfu.edu	Children of depressed parents are significantly more likely to develop  depression and other mental health disorders than are children of  never-depressed parents. Investigations of the physiological mechanisms  underlying this elevated risk have generally focused on basal functioning. It is  important to note, however, that physiological reactivity or responses to stress  are also critical determinants of mental and physical health. In the current  study, we examined whether children of depressed parents exhibit altered  physiological responses to stress. In two studies, never-depressed adolescent  daughters of either recurrently depressed mothers (RISK) or never-depressed  mothers (CTL) underwent social stressors while their physiological responses  were measured (cortisol in Study 1, heart rate in Study 2). In both studies,  affective responses to the stressors predicted physiological responses in RISK  girls, but not in never-depressed girls. For RISK girls, decreased positive  affect in response to stress predicted increased cortisol reactivity; in  addition, decreased positive affect and increased negative affect were  associated with poorer heart rate recovery and habituation, respectively. Future  research is needed to examine explicitly whether this coherence between affect  and physiology is a mechanism underlying the increased risk for psychopathology  in children of depressed parents.

The adaptation and well-being of adolescent immigrants in Greek schools: a  multilevel, longitudinal study of risks and resources.	Motti-Stefanidi F(1), Asendorpf JB, Masten AS.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, School of Philosophy, University of Athens,  Panepistimiopoli, Athens 15784, Greece. frmotti@psych.uoa.gr	This study examined growth patterns in adaptation of immigrant youth from a risk  and resilience perspective. Students from first- and second-generation immigrant  families living in Greece and their nonimmigrant classmates (N = 1,057) were  assessed over the first 3 years of secondary school (ages 13-15). Three-level  hierarchical linear models were used to disentangle individual and  classroom-level effects on initial level and change in academic achievement,  conduct, peer popularity, and psychological well-being. At the individual level,  adaptation was more related to self-efficacy and parental school involvement  (resources) than immigrant status and social adversity (risks). Only for  academic achievement did risks explain variance when resources were controlled.  Parental school involvement moderated the effect of immigrant status for initial  level and growth in achievement. For all students, achievement and conduct  worsened over time. At the classroom level, socioeconomic and ethnic composition  of the classroom moderated the effects of self-efficacy and immigrant status on  academic achievement and peer popularity, respectively. Second-generation  immigrants were more popular than first-generation immigrants, but showed a  larger decrease over time in school achievement. Results support a  developmental, differentiated, and contextualized approach to the study of  immigrant youth adaptation.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412000090 PMID: 22559124 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Marshfield Clinic, Riverview Center, 1000 Starr Avenue, Eau Claire, WI 54703,  USA. hanson.daniel@marshfieldclinic.org	Norman Garmezy devoted the better part of four decades developing and promoting  the construct of resilience for developmental psychopathology. He proposed  resilience as a paradigm to guide the understanding of how people can transcend  adversity and go on to live healthy, productive lives. This tribute to Norman  starts with a look at the early context for his work during his distinguished  tenure in the Department of Psychology at the University of Minnesota.  Resilience constructs are then compared from interdisciplinary perspectives  across a variety of biological and physical sciences. All of these perspectives  lead to similar conclusions: resilience is not a thing but a process.  Furthermore, the processes are the product of energy-hungry systems. Finally,  these insights are applied to difficult to modify maladaptive behaviors raising  the question of a dark side to resilience.

Masten AS(1), Tellegen A.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnestoa, 51 East River Road,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. amasten@umn.edu	Contributions of the Project Competence Longitudinal Study (PCLS) to resilience  science and developmental psychopathology are highlighted in this article.  Initiated by Norman Garmezy, the PCLS contributed models, measures, and methods,  as well as working definitions of concepts like competence, developmental tasks,  protective factors, and resilience. Findings from the study corroborated the  feasibility of studying adaptation in a normative group of school children,  identifying patterns of resilience, competence without major adversity, and  maladaptive paths through life. Competence was multidimensional, showing  continuity and change over time. Cascading effects across domains indicated that  competence and problems spread over time. Thus, adult achievements in  developmental tasks were rooted in childhood and adolescence. Young people who  showed resilience had much in common with similarly successful peers who  experienced less adversity over time, including high-quality relationships with  parents and other adults, and good cognitive, as well as social-emotional,  skills. Maladaptive youth in the study often faced high adversity with little  adaptive capacity (internal or external) and tended to generate stressful  experiences. Resilience often emerged in childhood and endured, but there also  were late bloomers whose lives turned around in the transition to adulthood. The  role of collaboration and mentorship in the PCLS is also discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941200003X PMID: 22559118 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)MRC Social Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of  Psychiatry, King’s College London, Denmark Hill, London SE5 8AF, UK.  michael.rutter@kcl.ac.uk	The concept of resilience has as its starting point the recognition that there  is huge heterogeneity in people's responses to all manner of environmental  adversities. Resilience is an inference based on evidence that some individuals  have a better outcome than others who have experienced a comparable level of  adversity; moreover, the negative experience may have either a sensitizing  effect or a strengthening "steeling" effect in relation to the response to later  stress or adversity. After noting the crucial importance of first testing for  the environmental mediation of risk through "natural experiments," findings are  reviewed on "steeling effects" in animal models and humans. Gene-environment  interaction findings are considered, and it is noted that there is some evidence  that the genetic influences concerns responsivity to all environments and not  just bad ones. Life course effects are reviewed in relation to evidence on  turning point effects associated with experiences that increase opportunities  and enhance coping. Attention is drawn to both research implications and  substantive findings as features that foster resilience.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412000028 PMID: 22559117 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Low S(1), Shortt JW, Snyder J.	Author information: (1)Wichita State University, Wichita, KS 67260, USA. Sabina.low@wichita.edu	The longitudinal associations of older sibling substance use as well as dyadic  sibling conflict and collusion to younger sibling substance use were examined in  a community-based sample of 244 same-sex sibling pairs. Indirect effects of  older siblings on younger sibling substance use were hypothesized via younger  sibling deviant peer affiliation and conflict with friends. Adolescents,  parents, friends, and teachers completed measures of substance use, conflict,  and deviant peer involvement. Observational data were used for both measures of  collusion and conflict. Findings suggest that older sibling substance use has a  direct effect on younger sibling use, but relationship dynamics and  reinforcement played a significant role as well. Specifically, collusion and  conflict in the sibling relationship both had indirect effects through younger  siblings' deviant peer affiliation. Findings validate the powerful socializing  role of both siblings and peers, and elucidate the complex mechanisms through  which socialization occurs. Furthermore, data underscore the importance of  considering how multiple dimensions of socialization operate in the elaboration  of antisocial behavior.

Author information: (1)Rand Corporation, 4570 Fifth Avenue, Suite 600, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-2665,  USA. lsontag@rand.org	The study examined the interaction between early maturational timing (measured  by premature adrenarche [PA]) and executive functioning and cortisol reactivity  on symptoms of psychopathology. The study included 76 girls aged 6 through 8  years (mean = 7.50, SD = 0.85) with PA (n = 40) and on-time adrenarche (n = 36).  Girls completed a battery of psychological and neuropsychological tests and  blood sampling for cortisol. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist. The  results demonstrated that girls with PA with lower levels of executive  functioning had higher externalizing and anxious symptoms compared to other  girls. In addition, girls with PA who demonstrated increases in serum cortisol  had higher externalizing symptoms than those with stable patterns. Finally,  girls with PA who demonstrated decreases in cortisol reported higher depressive  symptoms. The findings from this study provide important information concerning  the impact of cognitive functioning and stress reactivity on adjustment to early  maturation in girls with PA. The results of this research may inform screening  and intervention efforts for girls who may be at greatest risk for emotional and  behavioral problems as a result of early maturation.

The serotonin transporter gene linked polymorphic region is associated with the  behavioral response to repeated stress exposure in infant rhesus macaques.	Spinelli S(1), Schwandt ML, Lindell SG, Heilig M, Suomi SJ, Higley JD, Goldman  D, Barr CS.	Author information: (1)National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. spinellisimona@gmail.com	The short allele of the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region  (5-HTTLPR) moderates the effects of stress on vulnerability to mood and anxiety  disorders. The mechanism by which this occurs may relate to differential  sensitivity to stressful life events. Here we explored whether 5-HTTLPR and sex  affected behavioral responses to repeated maternal separation in infant rhesus  macaques. Behaviors were collected during the acute (Day 1) and the chronic  (Days 2-4) phases of the separation, and the effects of duration of separation  (acute vs. chronic), genotype (long/long vs. short allele), and sex (male vs.  female) on behavioral responses were analyzed across four successive  separations. Males increased their levels of locomotion with repeated maternal  separation, whereas females exhibited an increase in frequency of self-directed  behavior, a measure of "depression-like" behavior. The short-allele predicted  increased environmental exploration, particularly during the chronic phase of  social separation, indicative of higher arousal. In addition, the short-allele  carriers were more likely to increase their levels of self-directed behavior  during the chronic phase of separation, as a function of repeated exposures.  These findings suggest that the short allele may increase reactivity to  repeated, chronic stressors, leaving them more vulnerable to affective  psychopathology, with females particularly vulnerable.

Studies using the Emotional Availability Scales have burgeoned in the past  decade. The collection of papers included in this Special Section represents the  latest innovations in research with this paradigm. Consistent with a  developmental psychopathology perspective, these papers evaluate emotional  availability in a variety of typical, at-risk, international, and  intergenerational samples of children and caregivers, with many utilizing  longitudinal designs or employing measures from multiple levels of analysis. One  study begins to translate findings from this body of research into a promising  intervention program. Although further growth and refinement in research with  this paradigm is needed, the results to date begin to place the construct of  emotional availability into a complex, dynamic biopsychosocial context, and  promise to inspire a new generation of studies. In this commentary, some of the  key contributions and challenges of this collection of studies are highlighted  using a developmental psychopathology framework.

Infants' responsiveness, attachment, and indiscriminate friendliness after  international adoption from institutions or foster care in China: application of  Emotional Availability Scales to adoptive families.	Van Den Dries L(1), Juffer F, Van Ijzendoorn MH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, Alink  LR.	Author information: (1)Leiden University, The Netherlands.	In a short-term longitudinal design we investigated maternal sensitivity, child  responsiveness, attachment, and indiscriminate friendliness in families with  children internationally adopted from institutions or foster care in China.  Ninety-two families with 50 postinstitutionalized and 42 formerly fostered  girls, aged 11-16 months on arrival, were studied 2 and 6 months after adoption.  Maternal sensitivity and child responsiveness were observed with the Emotional  Availability Scales, attachment was assessed with the Strange Situation  procedure, and mothers reported on children's indiscriminate friendliness. The  postinstitutionalized children showed less secure attachment, whereas the former  foster children did not differ from the normative distribution of attachment  security. However, at both assessments the two groups of adopted children showed  more disorganized attachments compared to normative data. Adoptive mothers of  postinstitutionalized and former foster children were equally sensitive and  their sensitivity did not change over time. Postinstitutionalized and former  foster children did not differ on indiscriminate friendliness, but children with  more sensitive adoptive mothers showed less indiscriminate friendliness. The  former foster children showed a larger increase in responsiveness over time than  the postinstitutionalized children, suggesting that children's responsiveness is  more sensitive to change than attachment, and that preadoption foster care is  more beneficial for the development of children's responsiveness after adoptive  placement than preadoption institutional care.

Author information: (1)Psychology Department, Sonoma State University, 1801 East Cotati Avenue,  Rohnert Park, CA 94928, USA. missy.garvin@sonoma.edu	Children adopted from institutions (e.g., orphanages) overseas are at increased  risk of disturbances in social relationships and social understanding. Not all  postinstitutionalized children exhibit these problems, although factors like the  severity of deprivation and duration of deprivation increase their risk. To  date, few studies have examined whether postadoption parenting might moderate  the impact of early adverse care. Three groups were studied:  postinstitutionalized and foster care children both adopted internationally and  nonadopted children reared in their families of origin. The Emotional  Availability (EA) Scales were assessed at 18 months in parent-child dyads.  Parent emotional availability was found to predict two aspects of social  functioning shown in previous studies to be impaired in postinstitutionalized  children. Specifically, EA positively correlated with emotion understanding at  36 months; in interaction with initiation of joint attention at 18 months and  group, it predicted indiscriminate friendliness as scored from a parent  attachment interview at 30 months. Among the postinstitutionalized children but  not among the children in other groups, higher EA scores reduced the negative  association between initiation of joint attention and indiscriminate  friendliness, thus suggesting that parenting quality may moderate the effects of  early institutional deprivation.

Caserta MT(1), Wyman PA, Wang H, Moynihan J, O'Connor TG.	Author information: (1)University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.  mary_caserta@urmc.rochester.edu	Experimental animal studies and adult research consistently show that stress  exposure and/or psychological symptoms are associated with poorer health and  immune functioning. The application to children is not yet clear, however, and  we lack developmental models for studies in this area. The objective of this  paper was to test the hypothesis that self-reported self-efficacy and  depression, two markers of psychological well-being in children, would predict  immunity and rate of illnesses. The data are based on a prospective study of 141  healthy, normally developing children aged 7-13 years who were recruited from an  ambulatory pediatric setting. Children completed self-efficacy and depression  measures and had blood obtained for IL-6 plasma levels and natural killer cell  functional assays on three occasions, 6 months apart. Parents maintained weekly  child illness diaries over 1 year using a thermometer to record fever. Parent  psychiatric symptoms and income were used as covariates. Results indicated that,  across the three occasions of measurement collected over the 1-year period,  higher perceived self-efficacy was significantly associated with lower plasma  interleukin 6 concentrations. There was no overall main effect of depressive  symptoms on immune measures; however, for older girls, higher depression was  associated with elevated natural killer cell cytotoxicity and an increased rate  of total illnesses and febrile illnesses. The findings provide some of the first  evidence that psychological processes are associated with immunity and health in  a normally developing sample of preadolescents. Furthermore, the pattern of  results suggests a modified model of a link between psychological well-being and  immunological processes in children. These results build on and expand research  on the notion of allostatic load and develop a groundwork for developmental  studies in this area.

Cicchetti D(1), Rogosch FA, Oshri A.	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, NY, USA. cicchett@umn.edu	Within an allostatic load framework, the effect of Gene × Environment (G × E)  interactions on diurnal cortisol regulation and internalizing symptomatology  were investigated. Variation in the corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1  (CRHR1) TAT haplotype and serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region  (5-HTTLPR) was determined in a sample of maltreated (n = 238, 21.4% with early  physical and sexual abuse) and nonmaltreated (n = 255) children (M age = 10.08)  participating in a summer research camp. Internalizing and depressive symptoms  were assessed by other and self-report. G × E effects for CRHR1 and maltreatment  and early abuse on diurnal cortisol regulation were observed; CRHR1 variation  was related to cortisol dysregulation only among maltreated children. Early  abuse and high internalizing symptoms also interacted to predict atypical  diurnal cortisol regulation. The interaction of CRHR1, 5-HTTLPR, and child  maltreatment (G × G × E) identified a subgroup of maltreated children with high  internalizing symptoms who shared the same combination of the two genes. The  findings support an allostatic load perspective on the effects of the chronic  stress associated with child maltreatment on cortisol regulation and  internalizing symptomatology as moderated by genetic variation.

Growth delay as an index of allostatic load in young children: predictions to  disinhibited social approach and diurnal cortisol activity.	Johnson AE(1), Bruce J, Tarullo AR, Gunnar MR.	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.	The goal of this study was to examine whether growth delay can serve as an index  of allostatic load during early development, as it is well known that the  activity of stress-mediating systems inhibits growth. The participants were  children adopted internationally from institutional care (n = 36), children  adopted internationally from foster care (n = 26), and nonadopted children (n =  35). For the adopted children, height for age and weight for height were  assessed at adoption; for all children, disinhibited social approach (DSA;  termed elsewhere as "indiscriminate friendliness") and diurnal cortisol were  assessed at 6-8 years (M = 6.9 years). For internationally adopted children in  general, and postinstitutionalized children specifically, linear growth delay  assessed at the time of adoption was associated with more dysregulated behavior  in response to an unfamiliar adult (i.e., greater DSA) and a more dysregulated  diurnal cortisol rhythm (i.e., higher late afternoon and evening values).  Further, among the most growth-delayed children, higher cortisol levels later in  the day were correlated with DSA. The potential for using growth delay as an  allostatic load indicator and the possible problems and limitations in its use  in child populations are discussed.

Author information: (1)Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849-5214, USA. elshemm@auburn.edu	Allostatic load theory hypothesizes that stress and the body's responses to  stressors contribute to longer term physiological changes in multiple systems  over time (allostasis), and that shifts in how these systems function have  implications for adjustment and health. We investigated these hypotheses with  longitudinal data from two independent samples (n = 413; 219 girls, 194 boys)  with repeated measures at ages 8, 9, 10, and 11. Initial parental marital  conflict and its change over time indexed children's exposure to an important  familial stressor, which was examined in interaction with children's respiratory  sinus arrhythmia (RSA) reactivity to laboratory tasks (stress response) to  predict children's basal levels of RSA over time. We also investigated  children's sex as an additional possible moderator. Our second research question  focused on examining whether initial levels and changes in resting RSA over time  predicted children's externalizing behavior. Boys with a strong RSA suppression  response to a frustrating laboratory task who experienced higher initial marital  conflict or increasing marital conflict over time showed decreases in their  resting RSA over time. In addition, boys' initial resting RSA (but not changes  in resting RSA over time) was negatively related to change over time in  externalizing symptoms. Findings for girls were more mixed. Results are  discussed in the context of developmental psychobiology, allostatic load, and  implications for the development of psychopathology.

Davies PT(1), Sturge-Apple ML, Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA.  patrick.davies@rochester.edu	Guided by an evolutionary model of allostatic load, this study examined the  hypothesis that the association between interparental aggression and subsequent  changes in children's cortisol reactivity to interparental conflict is moderated  by their temperamental dispositions. Participants of the multimethod,  longitudinal study included 201 2-year-old toddlers and their mothers. These  children experienced elevated levels of aggression between parents. Consistent  with the theory, the results indicated that interparental aggression predicted  greater cortisol reactivity over a 1-year period for children who exhibited high  levels of temperamental inhibition and vigilance. Conversely, for children with  bold, aggressive temperamental characteristics, interparental aggression was  marginally associated with diminished cortisol reactivity. Further underscoring  its implications for allostatic load, increasing cortisol reactivity over the  one year span was related to concomitant increases in internalizing symptoms but  decreases in attention and hyperactivity difficulties. In supporting the  evolutionary conceptualization, these results further supported the relative  developmental advantages and costs associated with escalating and dampened  cortisol reactivity to interparental conflict.

The combined effects of prenatal drug exposure and early adversity on  neurobehavioral disinhibition in childhood and adolescence.	Fisher PA(1), Lester BM, DeGarmo DS, Lagasse LL, Lin H, Shankaran S, Bada HS,  Bauer CR, Hammond J, Whitaker T, Higgins R.	Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center, Eugene, OR 97401, USA. philf@oslc.org	The negative effects of prenatal substance exposure on neurobiological and  psychological development and of early adversity are clear, but little is known  about their combined effects. In this study, multilevel analyses of the effects  of prenatal substance exposure and early adversity on the emergence of  neurobehavioral disinhibition in adolescence were conducted. Neurobehavioral  disinhibition has previously been observed to occur frequently in multiproblem  youth from high-risk backgrounds. In the present study, neurobehavioral  disinhibition was assessed via behavioral dysregulation and poor executive  function composite measures. Data were drawn from a prospective longitudinal  investigation of prenatal substance exposure that included 1,073 participants  followed from birth through adolescence. The results from latent growth modeling  analyses showed mean stability but significant individual differences in  behavioral dysregulation and mean decline with individual differences in  executive function difficulties. Prior behavioral dysregulation predicted  increased executive function difficulties. Prenatal drug use predicted the  emergence and growth in neurobehavioral disinhibition across adolescence  (directly for behavioral dysregulation and indirectly for executive function  difficulties via early adversity and behavioral dysregulation). Prenatal drug  use and early adversity exhibited unique effects on growth in behavioral  dysregulation; early adversity uniquely predicted executive function  difficulties. These results are discussed in terms of implications for theory  development, social policy, and prevention science.

Get them before they get you: trust, trustworthiness, and social cognition in  boys with and without externalizing behavior problems.	Sharp C(1), Ha C, Fonagy P.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, 126 Heyne Building, University of Houston, Houston,  TX 77024, USA. csharp2@uh.edu	Economic exchange games have rarely been applied to examine psychopathology in  youth. In the current study we adapted a trust game to investigate the relations  between externalizing behavior problems, trust, and trustworthiness. We were  particularly interested in the differential modulating impact of "known  identity" (vs. anonymous) condition of the task. Second, we examined whether  anomalies in trust behavior would correspond to social cognition manifested in  children with externalizing problems. A total of 171 (79 age-matched pairs) boys  (mean age = 12.84; SD = 1.80) were recruited from community groups where social  networks and relationships amongst peers have been established. A trust game was  played under two conditions: an anonymous version where the identity of the  trust game partner was not known and a "known identity" version where identities  were revealed. Results supported the conclusion that boys with externalizing  behavior problems are generally less trustworthy, but not less trusting and that  this was true especially for the known identity version of the game. Moreover,  anomalies in trust behavior were associated with hostile intentions, but not  reflective of a general theory of mind deficit. This study contributes to an  emerging literature using economic exchange games to investigate real-time,  real-life exchanges in relation to psychopathology.

Mother-child relationships, family context, and child characteristics as  predictors of anxiety symptoms in middle childhood.	Kerns KA(1), Siener S, Brumariu LE.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Kent State University, Kent, OH 44242, USA.  kkerns@kent.edu	The goal of the study was to examine several factors that may explain the  development of anxiety symptoms in middle childhood. Using data from the NICHD  Study of Early Child Care (n = 1,364 families), we examined mother-child  relationships, other aspects of family context, and child characteristics as  predictors of anxiety in preadolescence. Latent growth curve analyses revealed  that children who were more anxious at the beginning of middle childhood had  been more behaviorally inhibited as preschoolers, and in middle childhood lived  in families who experienced more negative life events and had mothers who were  more anxious. Children who became more anxious across middle childhood were less  behaviorally inhibited as preschoolers and in middle childhood perceived less  security in their attachments to their mothers, experienced more negative life  events, and had mothers who were more anxious. The findings illustrate the need  to include a broad set of risk factors in etiological models of anxiety. In  addition, the evidence for cumulative effects suggests several possible points  of intervention with anxious children and their parents.

Lunkenheimer ES(1), Olson SL, Hollenstein T, Sameroff AJ, Winter C.	Author information: (1)Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1570, USA.  erika.lunkenheimer@colostate.edu	Parent-child dyadic rigidity and negative affect contribute to children's higher  levels of externalizing problems. The present longitudinal study examined  whether the opposite constructs of dyadic flexibility and positive affect  predicted lower levels of externalizing behavior problems across the early  childhood period. Mother-child (N = 163) and father-child (n = 94) dyads engaged  in a challenging block design task at home when children were 3 years old.  Dynamic systems methods were used to derive dyadic positive affect and three  indicators of dyadic flexibility (range, dispersion, and transitions) from  observational coding. We hypothesized that the interaction between dyadic  flexibility and positive affect would predict lower levels of externalizing  problems at age 5.5 years as rated by mothers and teachers, controlling for  stability in externalizing problems, task time, child gender, and the child's  effortful control. The hypothesis was supported in predicting teacher ratings of  child externalizing from both mother-child and father-child interactions. There  were also differential main effects for mothers and fathers: mother-child  flexibility was detrimental and father-child flexibility was beneficial for  child outcomes. Results support the inclusion of adaptive and dynamic  parent-child coregulation processes in the study of children's early disruptive  behavior.

Risky shifts: how the timing and course of mothers' depressive symptoms across  the perinatal period shape their own and infant's stress response profiles.	Laurent HK(1), Ablow JC, Measelle J.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Wyoming, 1000 East University Avenue,  Laramie, WY 82071, USA. hlaurent@uwyo.edu	We investigated the effects of timing and the course of maternal perinatal  depressive symptoms on mother-infant hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)  response profiles during an attachment stressor, as well as on within-dyad  synchrony of stress profiles: coordination of HPA and sympathetic nervous system  and infant-mother HPA attunement. Mothers (n = 86) completed the Center for  Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale during pregnancy (Time 1 [T1]) and at 5  months (T2) and 18 months (T3) postnatal. At T3 mother-infant dyads completed  the Strange Situation, and four saliva samples collected from both mothers and  infants were assayed for cortisol and α-amylase. Hierarchical linear modeling  was used to predict mother-infant cortisol response trajectories and within-dyad  synchronies by main and interactive effects of T1-T3 Center for Epidemiological  Studies Depression Scale scores. Main effects of earlier (T1, T2) depressive  symptoms predicted mothers' cortisol trajectories and coordination, and  interactions of T1 with postnatal (T2 and T3) symptoms predicted infants'  cortisol trajectories, coordination, and attunement. Decomposition of  interactions revealed more marked effects on infant cortisol trajectories when  the mother shifted from higher to lower depressive symptoms (or vice versa)  across the perinatal period. Shifts from lower to higher symptoms also predicted  inverse coordination of cortisol with salivary α-amylase and greater attunement  of infant with mother cortisol. Implications for the development and  transmission of stress dysregulation are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579411000083 PMID: 23786693 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The effects of child maltreatment and polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter  and dopamine D4 receptor genes on infant attachment and intervention efficacy.	Cicchetti D(1), Rogosch FA, Toth SL.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, 51 East River Road, University of Minnesota,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. cicchett@umn.edu	This investigation examined the extent to which polymorphisms of the serotonin  transporter linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) and the dopamine receptor D4  (DRD4) genes differentially influenced the development of attachment security  and disorganization in maltreated and nonmaltreated infants at age 13 months,  and the extent to which the efficacy of preventive interventions to promote  attachment security were influenced by genetic variation. The sample consisted  of 106 infants from maltreating families, participating in a randomized control  trial evaluating the efficacy of two interventions, child-parent psychotherapy  and psychoeducational parenting intervention, and 47 infants from nonmaltreating  families. DNA samples were genotyped for polymorphisms of 5-HTTLPR, DRD4 exon  III variable number tandem repeat, and DRD4-521. Attachment organization at age  1 and at age 2 was assessed with the Strange Situation for all participants,  prior to and following the completion of the interventions. High rates of  disorganized attachment were observed in the maltreatment compared to the  nonmaltreatment group, and both interventions resulted in increased rates of  attachment security at age 2. Genetic variation did not influence improvement in  attachment organization among maltreated infants. Among maltreated infants,  genetic variation had minimal effect on attachment organization. In contrast,  among nonmaltreated infants, 5-HTTLPR and DRD4 polymorphisms influenced  attachment security and disorganization at age 2 and the stability of attachment  disorganization over time.

Yap MB(1), Allen NB, O'Shea M, di Parsia P, Simmons JG, Sheeber L.	Author information: (1)Orygen Youth Health Research Centre, University of Melbourne, Victoria,  Australia.	This study examined the relations among temperament, emotion regulation, and  depressive symptoms in early adolescents. Early adolescents provided  self-reports of temperament on two occasions, as well as reports on emotion  regulation and depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, 163 of these adolescents  participated in event-planning and problem-solving interactions with their  mothers. Adolescents with temperaments that were high in negative emotionality  or low in effortful control displayed more emotionally dysregulated behaviors  during the interaction tasks, reported having maladaptive responses to negative  affect more often and adaptive responses less often, and had more depressive  symptoms. In particular, adolescents with the high negative emotionality and low  effortful control temperament combination reported the highest levels of  depressive symptomatology. Sequential analyses of family interactions indicated  that adolescents with more depressive symptoms were more likely to reciprocate  their mothers' negative affective behaviors. Adolescents' adaptive and  maladaptive responses to negative affect mediated the associations between their  temperament and concurrent depressive symptoms.

Biological sensitivity to context moderates the effects of the early  teacher-child relationship on the development of mental health by adolescence.	Essex MJ(1), Armstrong JM, Burk LR, Goldsmith HH, Boyce WT.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and  Public Health, 6001 Research Park Boulevard, Madison, WI 53719, USA.  mjessex@wisc.edu	The moderating effects of biological sensitivity to context (physiological and  behavioral stress reactivity) on the association between the early teacher-child  relationship and the development of adolescent mental health problems were  examined in a community sample of 96 children. Grade 1 measures of biological  sensitivity to context included physiological (i.e., slope of mean arterial  pressure across a 20- to 30-min stress protocol) and behavioral (i.e.,  temperamental inhibition/disinhibition) markers. Grade 1 measures of the  teacher-child relationship included positive (i.e., closeness) and negative  (i.e., conflict) qualities. Mental health symptoms were assessed at Grades 1 and  7. Results of a multiple regression analysis indicated substantial association  of the teacher-child relationship with the development of adolescent mental  health symptoms, especially for more reactive children. In addition to  teacher-child relationship main effects, all four Reactivity x Teacher-Child  Relationship interaction terms were statistically significant when controlling  for Grade 1 symptom severity, suggesting that both physiological and behavioral  reactivity moderate the association of both adverse and supportive aspects of  the teacher-child relationship with Grade 7 symptom severity over and above  Grade 1 severity. There were important differences, depending on which stress  reactivity measure was considered. The importance of these findings for recent  theoretical arguments regarding biological sensitivity to context and  differential susceptibility is discussed.

The interactive effect of marital conflict and stress reactivity on  externalizing and internalizing symptoms: the role of laboratory stressors.	Obradović J(1), Bush NR, Boyce WT.	Author information: (1)School of Education, Stanford University, 485 Lasuen Mall, Stanford, CA  94305-3096, USA. jelena.obradovic@stanford.edu	Growing evidence supports the biological sensitivity to context theory, which  posits that physiologically reactive children, as indexed by autonomic nervous  system (ANS) reactivity to laboratory stressors, are more susceptible to both  negative and positive environmental influences than their low reactive peers.  High biological sensitivity is a risk factor for behavioral and health problems  in the context of high adversity, whereas in contexts of low adversity it has  been found to promote positive adaptation. However, several studies have shown  the opposite effect, finding that children who exhibited high ANS reactivity in  response to interpersonal stressors were buffered from the deleterious effects  of marital conflict, whereas children who showed low ANS reactivity were more  vulnerable to high levels of marital conflict. Using an ethnically diverse  sample of 260 kindergartners (130 girls, 130 boys), the current study  investigated whether the interaction effect of marital conflict and the two  branches of ANS reactivity on children's externalizing and internalizing  symptoms differs with the nature of the laboratory challenge task used to  measure children's stress response. As hypothesized, results indicate that the  interaction between ANS reactivity and marital conflict significantly predicted  children's behavior problems, but the direction of the effect varied with the  nature of the challenge task (i.e., interpersonal or cognitive). This study  illustrates the importance of considering the effect of laboratory stimuli when  assessing whether children's ANS reactivity moderates the effects of adversity  exposure on adaptation.

Author information: (1)John and Doris Norton School of Family and Consumer Sciences, University of  Arizona, McClelland Park, 650 North Park Avenue, Tucson, AZ 85721-0078, USA.  bjellis@email.arizona.edu	Guided by evolutionary-developmental theories of biological sensitivity to  context and reproductive development, the current research examined the  interactive effects of early family environments and psychobiologic reactivity  to stress on the subsequent timing and tempo of puberty. As predicted by the  theory, among children displaying heightened biological sensitivity to context  (i.e., higher stress reactivity), higher quality parent-child relationships  forecast slower initial pubertal tempo and later pubertal timing, whereas lower  quality parent-child relationships forecast the opposite pattern. No such  effects emerged among less context-sensitive children. Whereas sympathetic  nervous system reactivity moderated the effects of parent-child relationships on  both breast/genital and pubic hair development, adrenocortical activation only  moderated the effect on pubic hair development. The current results build on  previous research documenting what family contexts predict variation in pubertal  timing by demonstrating for whom those contexts matter. In addition, the authors  advance a new methodological approach for assessing pubertal tempo using  piecewise growth curve analysis.

Differential susceptibility to rearing environment depending on dopamine-related  genes: new evidence and a meta-analysis.	Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ(1), van Ijzendoorn MH.	Author information: (1)Centre for Child and Family Studies, Leiden University, P.O. Box 9555, Leiden  2300 RB, The Netherlands. bakermans@fsw.leidenuniv.nl	In the current paper we present new empirical data and meta-analytic evidence  for the role of dopamine-related genes as a susceptibility factor interacting  with the rearing environment for better and for worse, that is, increasing  children's susceptibility to both the adverse effects of unsupportive  environments and the beneficial effects of supportive rearing. In Study 1 we  examined the readiness of 91 7-year-old children to donate their money to a  charity (UNICEF). We tested whether the association between attachment and  donating behavior was moderated by the presence of the dopamine receptor D4  (DRD4) 7-repeat allele. The attachment story completion task was used to assess  attachment as an index of the quality of the rearing environment. Children with  secure attachment representations donated more but only if they had the DRD4  7-repeat allele. In Study 2 we present the results of a meta-analysis of  gene-environment studies on children up to 10 years of age involving  dopamine-related genes (dopamine receptor D2, DRD4, dopamine transporter). The  cumulative negative effects of these "risk genes" and adverse rearing  environments have been stressed, but potentially cumulative positive effects of  these same genes interacting with positive rearing environments remained largely  unnoticed. We examined the associations between negative and positive rearing  environments and developmental outcomes as moderated by dopamine-related gene  polymorphisms. Children with the less efficient dopamine-related genes did worse  in negative environments than the comparisons without the "genetic risk," but  they also profited most from positive environments. Findings are discussed in  light of evolutionary theory, and illustrated with some practical implications  of differential susceptibility.

Author information: (1)John and Doris Norton School of Family and Consumer Sciences, University of  Arizona, McClelland Park, 650 North Park Avenue, Tucson, AZ 85721-0078, USA.  bjellis@email.arizona.edu	Two extant evolutionary models, biological sensitivity to context theory (BSCT)  and differential susceptibility theory (DST), converge on the hypothesis that  some individuals are more susceptible than others to both negative  (risk-promoting) and positive (development-enhancing) environmental conditions.  These models contrast with the currently dominant perspective on personal  vulnerability and environmental risk: diathesis stress/dual risk. We review  challenges to this perspective based on emerging theory and data from the  evolutionary, developmental, and health sciences. These challenges signify the  need for a paradigm shift in conceptualizing Person x Environment interactions  in development. In this context we advance an evolutionary--neurodevelopmental  theory, based on DST and BSCT, of the role of neurobiological susceptibility to  the environment in regulating environmental effects on adaptation, development,  and health. We then outline current thinking about neurogenomic and  endophenotypic mechanisms that may underpin neurobiological susceptibility,  summarize extant empirical research on differential susceptibility, and evaluate  the evolutionary bases and implications of BSCT and DST. Finally, we discuss  applied issues including methodological and statistical considerations in  conducting differential susceptibility research; issues of ecological, cultural,  and racial--ethnic variation in neurobiological susceptibility; and implications  of differential susceptibility for designing social programs. We conclude that  the differential susceptibility paradigm has far-reaching implications for  understanding whether and how much child and adult development responds, for  better and for worse, to the gamut of species-typical environmental conditions.

Author information: (1)Implementation Sciences International, Incorporated, and Oregon Social  Learning Center, 10 Shelton McMurphey Boulevard, Eugene, OR 97401, USA.  jerryp@oslc.org	Four different sources for cascade effects were examined using 9-year process  and outcome data from a randomized controlled trial of a preventive intervention  using the Parent Management Training-Oregon Model (PMTO™). The social  interaction learning model of child antisocial behavior serves as one basis for  predicting change. A second source addresses the issue of comorbid relationships  among clinical diagnoses. The third source, collateral changes, describes events  in which changes in one family member correlate with changes in another. The  fourth component is based on the long-term effects of reducing coercion and  increasing positive interpersonal processes within the family. New findings from  the 9-year follow-up show that mothers experienced benefits as measured by  standard of living (i.e., income, occupation, education, and financial stress)  and frequency of police arrests. It is assumed that PMTO reduces the level of  coercion, which sets the stage for a massive increase in positive social  interaction. In effect, PMTO alters the family environment and thereby opens  doors to healthy new social environments.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000568 PMCID: PMC2965055 PMID: 20883592 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Lynne-Landsman SD(1), Bradshaw CP, Ialongo NS.	Author information: (1)Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 624 North Broadway,  Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. slynne@jhsph.edu	Developmental models highlight the impact of early risk factors on both the  onset and growth of substance use, yet few studies have systematically examined  the indirect effects of risk factors across several domains, and at multiple  developmental time points, on trajectories of substance use and adult adjustment  outcomes (e.g., educational attainment, mental health problems, criminal  behavior). The current study used data from a community epidemiologically  defined sample of 678 urban, primarily African American youth, followed from  first grade through young adulthood (age 21) to test a developmental cascade  model of substance use and young adult adjustment outcomes. Drawing upon  transactional developmental theories and using growth mixture modeling  procedures, we found evidence for a developmental progression from behavioral  risk to adjustment problems in the peer context, culminating in a high-risk  trajectory of alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use during adolescence.  Substance use trajectory membership was associated with adjustment in adulthood.  These findings highlight the developmental significance of early individual and  interpersonal risk factors on subsequent risk for substance use and, in turn,  young adult adjustment outcomes.

Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, 187 Edinburgh St.,  Rochester, NY 14608, USA. fred.rogosch@rochester.edu	A developmental cascade model tested associations among child maltreatment,  internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, social competence, and cannabis  abuse and dependence symptoms in a longitudinal cohort (N = 415). Nested  structural equation models evaluated continuity and cross-domain influences  among broad multi-informant constructs across four developmental periods: age 7  to 9, 10 to 12, 13 to 15, and 15 to 18. Results indicated significant paths from  child maltreatment to early externalizing and internalizing problems and social  competence, as well as to cannabis abuse and dependence (CAD) symptoms in  adolescence. Youth CAD symptoms were primarily related directly to child  maltreatment and externalizing problems. Childhood internalizing symptoms  contributed to later childhood decreases in social competence, which predicted  increases in late adolescent externalizing problems. Using a developmental  psychopathology framework, results are discussed in relation to cascade and  transactional effects and the interplay between problem behaviors during  childhood and development of CAD symptoms during early and late adolescence.

Blandon AY(1), Calkins SD, Grimm KJ, Keane SP, O'Brien M.	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University.	A developmental cascade model of early emotional and social competence  predicting later peer acceptance was examined in a community sample of 440  children across the ages of 2 to 7. Children's externalizing behavior, emotion  regulation, social skills within the classroom and peer acceptance were examined  utilizing a multitrait-multimethod approach. A series of longitudinal cross-lag  models that controlled for shared rater variance were fit using structural  equation modeling. Results indicated there was considerable stability in  children's externalizing behavior problems and classroom social skills over  time. Contrary to expectations, there were no reciprocal influences between  externalizing behavior problems and emotion regulation, although higher levels  of emotion regulation were associated with decreases in subsequent levels of  externalizing behaviors. Finally, children's early social skills also predicted  later peer acceptance. Results underscore the complex associations among  emotional and social functioning across early childhood.

Masten AS(1), Desjardins CD, McCormick CM, Kuo SI, Long JD.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, 51 East River Road,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. amasten@umn.edu	Success in the domain of work is a salient developmental task of adulthood and a  key indicator of adaptive function in the evaluation of health and  psychopathology. Yet few studies have examined pathways to work competence,  especially with strategies testing for cumulative cascade effects over time.  Cascade models spanning 20 years were tested via structural equation modeling,  linking work competence in early adulthood to antecedent competence in work and  other domains of competence in childhood and emerging adulthood. Data were drawn  from the Project Competence longitudinal study of 205 school children followed  for 20 years. Relative fit of alternative models was evaluated by the Bayesian  information criterion. As hypothesized, the effectiveness of adaptive behavior  in earlier age-salient developmental task domains forecasted later work  competence, which also showed strong concurrent links to competence in other  domains. Results suggest there are numerous pathways by which success or failure  in major developmental task domains in childhood and adolescence may influence  adaptation in other domains and eventually work competence, both concurrently  and cumulatively over time. Cascade effects highlight the potential significance  for later work competence of childhood conduct (antisocial vs. rule-abiding  behavior) and social competence with peers, in addition to the ongoing role that  academic attainment may have for work success. Work competence also showed  considerable stability over a 10-year period during early adulthood.  Implications and applications for future research and intervention are  discussed.

Effects of childhood conduct problems and family adversity on health, health  behaviors, and service use in early adulthood: tests of developmental pathways  involving adolescent risk taking and depression.	Herrenkohl TI(1), Kosterman R, Mason WA, Hawkins JD, McCarty CA, McCauley E.	Author information: (1)University of Washington, Seattle, USA. tih@u.washington.edu	This study examined a developmental, cascade model that includes childhood risks  of conduct problems and family adversity at age 10-12; conduct problems, risk  taking, and internalizing during adolescence; and adult outcomes of conduct  problems, poor health, health risks, depression, and service use at ages 27 and  30. Analyses showed that childhood conduct problems predicted adolescent conduct  problems and risk taking, which in turn, predicted adult conduct problems,  health risks, depression, and service use. Childhood family adversity predicted  adolescent internalizing, a predictor itself of poor health, depression, and  service use at age 27. There was considerable continuity in the same adult  outcomes measured over a 3-year period, as well as some cross-domain prediction  from variables at age 27 to measures at age 30. Developmental patterns found in  these data offer implications for future research and prevention.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000349 PMCID: PMC2892805 PMID: 20576185 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Dishion TJ(1), Véronneau MH, Myers MW.	Author information: (1)Child and Family Center, University of Oregon, 195 West 12th Avenue, Eugene,  OR 97401-3408, USA. dishion@uoregon.edu	This study examined the peer dynamics linking early adolescent problem behavior,  school marginalization, and low academic performance to multiple indices of late  adolescent violence (arrests, parent report, and youth report) in an ethnically  diverse sample of 998 males and females. A cascade model was proposed in which  early adolescent risk factors assessed at age 11 to 12 predict gang involvement  at age 13 to 14, which in turn, predicts deviancy training with friends at age  16 to 17, which then predicts violence by age 18 to 19. Each construct in the  model was assessed with multiple measures and methods. Structural equation  modeling revealed that the cascade model fit the data well, with problem  behavior, school marginalization, and low academic performance significantly  predicting gang involvement 2 years later. Gang involvement, in turn, predicted  deviancy training with a friend, which predicted violence. The best fitting  model included an indirect and direct path between early adolescent gang  involvement and later violence. These findings suggest the need to carefully  consider peer clustering into gangs in efforts to prevent individual and  aggregate levels of violence, especially in youths who may be disengaged,  marginalized, or academically unsuccessful in the public school context.

Developmental cascades of peer rejection, social information processing biases,  and aggression during middle childhood.	Lansford JE(1), Malone PS, Dodge KA, Pettit GS, Bates JE.	Author information: (1)Center for Child and Family Policy, Duke University, Box 90545, Durham, NC  27708, USA. lansford@duke.edu	This study tested a developmental cascade model of peer rejection, social  information processing (SIP), and aggression using data from 585 children  assessed at 12 time points from kindergarten through Grade 3. Peer rejection had  direct effects on subsequent SIP problems and aggression. SIP had direct effects  on subsequent peer rejection and aggression. Aggression had direct effects on  subsequent peer rejection. Each construct also had indirect effects on each of  the other constructs. These findings advance the literature beyond a simple  mediation approach by demonstrating how each construct effects changes in the  others in a snowballing cycle over time. The progressions of SIP problems and  aggression cascaded through lower liking, and both better SIP skills and lower  aggression facilitated the progress of social preference. Findings are discussed  in terms of the dynamic, developmental relations among social environments,  cognitions, and behavioral adjustment.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-1004,  USA. nancy.eisenberg@asu.edu	In a sample of 18-, 30-, and 42-month-olds, the relations among parenting,  effortful control (EC), and maladjustment were examined. Parenting was assessed  with mothers' reports and observations; EC was measured with mothers' and  caregivers' reports, as well as a behavioral task; and externalizing and  internalizing symptoms were assessed with parents' and caregivers' reports.  Although 18-month unsupportive (vs. supportive) parenting negatively predicted  EC at 30 months, when the stability of these variables was taken into account,  there was no evidence of additional potentially causal relations between these  two constructs. Although EC was negatively related to both internalizing and  externalizing problems within all three ages as well as across 1 year, EC did  not predict maladjustment once the stability of the constructs and within time  covariation between the constructs were taken into account. In addition,  externalizing problems at 30 months negatively predicted EC at 42 months, and  internalizing problems at 30 months positively predicted EC at 42 months, but  only when the effects of externalizing on EC were controlled. The findings are  discussed in terms of the reasons for the lack of causal relations over time.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000246 PMCID: PMC3018696 PMID: 20576175 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department and Center for Developmental Sciences, 216 Davie Hall, CB 3270,  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3270, USA.  martha_cox@unc.edu	In the wake of prominent theoreticians in developmental science, whose  contributions we review in this article, many developmental psychologists came  to endorse a systems approach to understanding how the individual, as it  develops, establishes functional relationships to social ecological contexts  that from birth to school entry rapidly increase in complexity. The concept of  developmental cascade has been introduced in this context to describe lawful  processes by which antecedent conditions may be related with varying  probabilities to specified outcomes. These are understood as processes by which  function at one level or in one domain of behavior affect the organization of  competency in later developing domains of general adaptation. Here we propose a  developmental sequence by which the developing child acquires regulative  capacities that are key to adjustment to a society that demands considerable  control of emotional and cognitive functions early in life. We report empirical  evidence showing that the acquisition of regulative capacities may be understood  as a cascade of shifts in control parameters induced by the progressive  integration of biological, transactional, and socioaffective systems over  development. We conclude by suggesting how the developmental process may be  accessed for effective intervention in populations deemed "at risk" for later  problems of psychosocial adjustment.

Because many serious adolescent offenders reduce their antisocial behavior after  court involvement, understanding the patterns and mechanisms of the process of  desistance from criminal activity is essential for developing effective  interventions and legal policy. This study examined patterns of self-reported  antisocial behavior over a 3-year period after court involvement in a sample of  1,119 serious male adolescent offenders. Using growth mixture models, and  incorporating time at risk for offending in the community, we identified five  trajectory groups, including a "persister" group (8.7% of the sample) and a  "desister" group (14.6% of the sample). Case characteristics (age, ethnicity,  antisocial history, deviant peers, a criminal father, substance use,  psychosocial maturity) differentiated the five trajectory groups well, but did  not effectively differentiate the persisting from desisting group. We show that  even the most serious adolescent offenders report relatively low levels of  antisocial activity after court involvement, but that distinguishing effectively  between high-frequency offenders who desist and those who persist requires  further consideration of potentially important dynamic factors related to this  process.

Rudolph KD(1), Troop-Gordon W.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Illinois, 603 East Daniel Street,  Champaign, IL 61820, USA. krudolph@illinois.edu	This research examined personal-accentuation and contextual-amplification models  of pubertal timing, wherein personal and contextual risks magnify the effects of  earlier pubertal maturation on youth depression. A sample of 167 youths (M age =  12.41 years, SD = 1.19) and their maternal caregivers completed semistructured  interviews and questionnaires at two waves. Consistent with a  personal-accentuation model, earlier pubertal maturation more strongly predicted  subsequent depression in youths with prior depression, certain personality  traits, and maladaptive stress responses than in youths without these personal  risks. Several of these effects were specific to earlier-maturing girls.  Consistent with a contextual-amplification model, earlier pubertal maturation  more strongly predicted subsequent depression in youths exposed to recent  maternal depression and family stress than in youths without these contextual  risks. These findings identify key characteristics of youths and their family  context that help to explain individual variation in depressive reactions to  earlier pubertal maturation. More broadly, this research contributes to  integrative models of depression that consider the interplay among personal  vulnerability, contextual risk, and developmental transitions.

Adolescent females exposed to child maltreatment exhibit atypical EEG coherence  and psychiatric impairment: linking early adversity, the brain, and  psychopathology.	Miskovic V(1), Schmidt LA, Georgiades K, Boyle M, Macmillan HL.	Author information: (1)McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT L8S 4K1, Canada.	Although the relation between child maltreatment and psychiatric impairment is  well documented and preliminary evidence has linked child maltreatment with  aberrant cortical connectivity of the left hemisphere, no investigations have  attempted to examine these relations in the same study. Here, we examined the  links among early adversity, brain connectivity, and functional outcomes. We  collected resting regional EEG intra- and interhemispheric alpha-band (7.5-12.5  Hz) coherence and measures of general psychiatric impairment from a cohort of 38  adolescent females exposed to child maltreatment (M age = 14.47) and 24  adolescent females not exposed to child maltreatment (M age = 14.00). Maltreated  youths exhibited more left hemisphere EEG coherence than the control youths,  suggesting a suboptimal organization of cortical networks. Maltreated  participants also showed reduced frontal (anterior) interhemispheric coherence.  These differences in brain circuitry remained statistically significant even  after controlling for group differences in pubertal status and socioeconomic  status. Measures of functional brain connectivity were associated with several  subtypes of abuse and neglect. It was important that atypical left hemisphere  EEG coherence mediated the effects of child maltreatment on levels of  psychiatric impairment. The findings are discussed in the context of models  linking early adversity to brain function and psychopathology.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000155 PMID: 20423551 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

This study prospectively  examined the lives of individuals in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and  Youth Development whose patterns of antisocial behavior varied with respect to  age of onset and stability from kindergarten through age 15. Consistent with  past research, early-onset, persistently deviant youth experienced more  contextual adversity and evinced higher levels of intraindividual disadvantages  than their peers from infancy through midadolescence. However, relative to youth  who never showed significantly elevated antisocial behavior through age 15,  children who showed antisocial behavior primarily in adolescence also were more  disadvantaged from infancy forward, as were youth who only demonstrated  significant externalizing problems in childhood. Findings generally replicated  across sex and did not vary as a function of whether antisocial behavior groups  were defined using T-scores normed within sex or identified using an empirically  driven grouping method applied to raw data.

The development of paradigms, or perspectives of research takes place at the  level of theory, in the domain of methodology, and in the context of existing  paradigms and perspectives. The development of the person-oriented approach has  made considerable progress at the level of theory. In addition, the approach has  found a large number of applications. Sterba and Bauer's Keynote Article has  closed a gap by discussing methodological implications of the person-oriented  approach. In particular, the authors have discussed whether and, if yes, how the  tenets of the person-oriented approach can be tested using tools of applied  statistics popular in current empirical psychological research. Continuing this  discussion, this article focuses on recent developments in all three areas.  First, the importance and the implications of the concept of dimensional  identity are discussed. It is argued that dimensional identity needs to be  established across time and individuals for comparisons to be valid, both in  person-oriented and in variable-oriented research. Second, methods not covered  in Sterba and Bauer's Keynote are discussed and their application is  exemplified. One focus of this discussion is on configural frequency analysis,  which allows researchers to make statements about particular cells or groups of  cells in cross-classifications of categorical variables. Third, person-oriented  research is compared to differential psychology. It is argued that the concept  of dimensional identity represents the next step in the development of a  psychological subdiscipline that allows one to consider that individuals differ  and develop in unique ways. These differences not only manifest in means but in  any parameter, including covariance structures, and they can also manifest in  the differential meaningfulness of variables for the description of individuals.

Sterba and Bauer's Keynote Article does a superb job of reviewing the "...  assumptions, strengths, and limitations of model-based person-oriented  methods-clarifying which theoretical principles [researchers] can test and the  compromises and trade-offs required to do so." Their writing is exceptionally  clear, and the examples given highly instructive. At the same time, their  arguments may be so convincing that the reader may be reluctant to pursue  person-oriented analyses in a longitudinal context. The purpose of this  Commentary is not to contradict Sterba and Bauer's arguments but to briefly  review the steps that substantive researchers can take in building a  scientifically strong case for either assuming continuously varied growth "...  or that [trajectory groups] actually exist" according to Raudenbush. These steps  have been elaborated in a series of papers by Muthén and colleagues, but it is  useful to briefly review them here.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000040 PMID: 20423541 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Corumination, interpersonal stress generation, and internalizing symptoms:  accumulating effects and transactional influences in a multiwave study of  adolescents.	Hankin BL(1), Stone L, Wright PA.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Denver, Denver, CO 80208, USA.  ben.hankin@psy.du.edu	This multiwave longitudinal study investigated potential transactional and  accumulating influences among corumination, interpersonal stressors, and  internalizing symptoms among a sample of early and middle adolescents (N = 350;  6th-10th graders). Youth completed self-report measures of corumination at Times  1, 2, and 4, and negative life events, internalizing symptoms (general  depressive, specific anhedonic depressive, anxious arousal, general  internalizing), and externalizing problems at all four time points (5 weeks  between each assessment across 4 months). Results supported hypotheses. First,  baseline corumination predicted prospective trajectories of all forms of  internalizing symptoms but not externalizing problems. Second, baseline  corumination predicted generation of interpersonal-dependent, but not  interpersonal-independent or noninterpersonal stressors. Third,  interpersonal-dependent events partially mediated the longitudinal association  between baseline corumination and prospective internalizing symptoms. Fourth, a  transactional, bidirectional set of associations was supported in that initial  internalizing symptoms and stressors predicted later elevations in corumination,  and in turn, corumination predicted later symptoms through the mediating role of  interpersonal stressors to complete both streams in the transactional chain of  influence. Fifth, girls and older adolescents exhibited higher corumination, but  neither age nor sex moderated any associations. These findings are discussed  within a transactional, developmental cascade model.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409990368 PMCID: PMC4031463 PMID: 20102657 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Imitating actions on objects in early-onset and regressive autism: effects and  implications of task characteristics on performance.	Rogers SJ(1), Young GS, Cook I, Giolzetti A, Ozonoff S.	Author information: (1)University of California Davis, USA. sally.rogers@ucdmc.ucdavis.edu	This study was designed to examine the nature of object imitation performance in  early autism. We hypothesized that imitation would be relatively preserved when  behaviors on objects resulted in salient instrumental effects. We designed tasks  in which, in one condition, the motor action resulted in a salient, meaningful  effect on an object, whereas in the other condition, the same action resulted in  a less salient effect because of differing object characteristics. The motor  aspects of the tasks did not vary across conditions. Four participant groups of  2- to 5-year-olds were examined: 17 children with early-onset autism, 24  children with regressive onset autism, 22 children with developmental delays,  and 22 children with typical development. Groups were matched on nonverbal  skills, and differences in verbal development were examined as a moderator of  imitative ability. Results revealed an interaction of group by condition, with  the combined autism group failing more tasks than the combined comparison  groups, and failing more tasks in the less salient condition than in the more  salient condition, as hypothesized. Analyses of autism subgroups revealed these  effects were primarily because of the regression onset group. Accuracy of motor  performance was examined by analyzing errors. Among children passing imitative  acts, there were no group differences and no condition effects in the number,  type, or pattern of performance errors. Among children passing the tasks, the  group with autism did not demonstrate more emulation errors (imitating the goal  but not the means) than other groups. There was no evidence that either motor or  attentional aspects of the tasks contributed to the poorer imitative performance  of the children with autism.

Effects of sex and early maternal abuse on adrenocorticotropin hormone and  cortisol responses to the corticotropin-releasing hormone challenge during the  first 3 years of life in group-living rhesus monkeys.	Sanchez MM(1), McCormack K, Grand AP, Fulks R, Graff A, Maestripieri D.	Author information: (1)Emory University, USA.	In this study we investigated the development of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in 21 group-living rhesus monkeys  infants that were physically abused by their mothers in the first few months of  life and in 21 nonabused controls. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropin hormone  (ACTH) responses to a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) challenge were  assessed at 6-month intervals during the subjects' first 3 years of life. Abused  infants exhibited greater cortisol responses to CRH than controls across the 3  years. Abused infants also exhibited blunted ACTH secretion in response to CRH,  especially at 6 months of age. Although there were no significant sex  differences in abuse experienced early in life, females showed a greater  cortisol response to CRH than males at all ages. There were no significant sex  differences in the ACTH response to CRH, or significant interactions between sex  and abuse in the ACTH or cortisol response. Our findings suggest that early  parental maltreatment results in greater adrenocortical, and possibly also  pituitary, responsiveness to challenges later in life. These long-term  alterations in neuroendocrine function may be one the mechanisms through which  infant abuse results in later psychopathologies. Our study also suggests that  there are developmental sex differences in adrenal function that occur  irrespective of early stressful experience. The results of this study can  enhance our understanding of the long-term effects of child maltreatment as well  as our knowledge of the development of the HPA axis in human and nonhuman  primates.

Author information: (1)University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-1525, USA.	Developmental adaptations to violent environments involve a multitude of  cascading effects spanning many levels of analysis from genes to behavior. In  this review, we (a) examine the potentiating effects of violence on genetic  vulnerabilities and the functioning of neurotransmitter systems in producing  both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology; (b) describe implications  of violence exposure for brain development, particularly within the hippocampus  and prefrontal cortex; and (c) consider the effects of violence on developing  human stress and startle responses. This review integrates literatures on the  developmental effects of violence among rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans.  Many neurobiological changes that are adaptive for survival in violent contexts  become maladaptive in other environments, conferring life-long risk for  psychopathology.

Stability, change, and heritability of borderline personality disorder traits  from adolescence to adulthood: a longitudinal twin study.	Bornovalova MA(1), Hicks BM, Iacono WG, McGue M.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, 75 East River Road,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. borno004@umn.edu	Although personality disorders are best understood in the context of lifetime  development, there is a paucity of work examining their longitudinal trajectory.  An understanding of the expected course and the genetic and environmental  contributions to these disorders is necessary for a detailed understanding of  risk processes that lead to their manifestation. The current study examined the  longitudinal course and heritability of borderline personality disorder (BPD)  over a period of 10 years starting in adolescence (age 14) and ending in  adulthood (age 24). In doing so, we built on existing research by using a large  community sample of adolescent female twins, a sensitive dimensional measure of  BPD traits, an extended follow-up period, and a longitudinal twin design that  allowed us to investigate the heritability of BPD traits at four discrete ages  spanning midadolescence to early adulthood. Results indicated that mean-level  BPD traits significantly decline from adolescence to adulthood, but rank order  stability remained high. BPD traits were moderately heritable at all ages, with  a slight trend for increased heritability from age 14 to age 24. A genetically  informed latent growth curve model indicated that both the stability and change  of BPD traits are highly influenced by genetic factors and modestly by nonshared  environmental factors. Our results indicate that as is the case for other  personality dimensions, trait BPD declines as individuals mature from  adolescence to adulthood, and that this process is influenced in part by the  same genetic factors that influence BPD trait stability.

A  methodological framework and illustration from the Longitudinal Study of  Personality Disorders.	Lenzenweger MF(1), Willett JB.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, State University of New York at Binghamton, Science  IV, Binghamton, NY 13902-6000, USA. mlenzen@binghamton.edu	Personality disorders (PDs) have been thought historically to be enduring,  inflexible, and set in psychological stone relatively firmly; however, empirical  findings from recent prospective multiwave longitudinal studies establish  otherwise. Nearly all modern longitudinal studies of personality disorder have  documented considerable change in PDs over time, suggesting considerable  flexibility and plasticity in this realm of psychopathology. The factors and  mechanisms of change in the PDs remain essentially opaque, and this area of PD  research is just beginning to be probed using candidate predictors of change,  such as personality systems. In this report, we investigate whether change in  temperament dimensions (emotionality, activity, and sociability) predicts change  in schizoid personality disorder. We present a latent growth framework for  addressing this question and provide an illustration of the approach using data  from the Longitudinal Study of Personality Disorders. Schizoid personality  disorder was assessed using two different methodologies (structured psychiatric  interview and self-report) and temperament was assessed using a well-known  psychometric measure of temperament. All constructs were measured at three time  points over a 4-year time period. To analyze these panel data, we fitted a  covariance structure model that hypothesized simultaneous relationships between  initial levels and rates of change in temperament and initial levels and rates  of change in schizoid personality disorder. We found that rates of change in the  core temperament dimensions studied do not predict rates of change in schizoid  personality over time. We discuss the methodological advantages of the latent  growth approach and the substantive meaning of the findings for change in  schizoid personality disorder.

Author information: (1)School of Social Service Administration, University of Chicago, 969 East 60th  Street, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. shans@uchicago.edu	Schizophrenia has come to be viewed as a neurodevelopmental disorder that is  characterized by genetic vulnerability, stressors during the prenatal period  that may be marked by minor physical anomalies and neurobehavioral deficits that  emerge in early development. Less is known about the neurodevelopmental origins  of schizotypal personality symptoms. The present study examines schizotypal  symptoms in Israeli adolescents (mean age = 16.79 years) who have not yet  reached the developmental period during which first schizophrenic episode is  most likely to emerge: 39 adolescent offspring of parents with schizophrenia, 39  offspring of parents with other psychiatric disorders, and 36 offspring of  parents with no history of mental illness. The Semi-Structured Kiddie Interview  for Personality Syndromes was used to assess cognitive-perceptual,  interpersonal, and disorganized schizotypal symptoms. Interpersonal schizotypal  symptoms were more prevalent in the schizophrenia offspring group than in the  no-mental-illness offspring group. Among the schizophrenia offspring group,  interpersonal, but not cognitive-perceptual, schizotypal symptoms were  associated with minor physical anomalies, fine motor dyscoordination, and  deficits in executive functioning during adolescence. Among young people whose  parents did not have schizophrenia, cognitive-perceptual schizotypal symptoms  were correlated with deficits in executive functioning. Adolescent schizotypal  symptoms were associated with neurobehavioral symptoms measured during middle  childhood in a subgroup of the sample that had been assessed prospectively.  Finally, young people who had genetic risk for schizophrenia, minor physical  anomalies, and neurobehavioral signs together were at markedly increased risk  for symptoms of interpersonal schizotypal symptoms, compared to young people  with one or none of these risk factors.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of New Orleans, 2001 Geology and  Psychology Building, New Orleans, LA 70148, USA. pfrick@uno.edu	This paper reviews research on chronic patterns of antisocial behavior and  places this research into a developmental psychopathology framework.  Specifically, research suggests that there are at least three important pathways  through which children and adolescents can develop severe antisocial behaviors.  One group of youth shows antisocial behavior that begins in adolescence, and two  groups show antisocial behavior that begins in childhood but differ on the  presence or absence of callous-unemotional traits. In outlining these distinct  pathways to antisocial behavior, we have tried to illustrate some key concepts  from developmental psychopathology such as equifinality and multifinality, the  importance of understanding the interface between normal and abnormal  development, and the importance of using multiple levels of analyses to advance  causal theories. Finally, we discuss how this development model can be used to  enhance existing interventions for antisocial individuals.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409990071 PMID: 19825260 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Human Development and Family Studies, P.O. Box 26170,  University of North Carolina, Greensboro, NC 27402-6170, USA. sdcalkin@uncg.edu	Early antisocial behavior has its origins in childhood behavior problems,  particularly those characterized by aggressive and destructive behavior.  Deficits in self-regulation across multiple domains of functioning, from the  physiological to the cognitive, are associated with early behavior problems, and  may place children at greater risk for the development of later antisocial  behavior. Data are presented from a longitudinal study of early self-regulation  and behavior problems, the RIGHT Track Research Project, demonstrating that  children at greatest risk for early and persistent problem behavior display  patterns of physiological and emotional regulation deficits early in life.  Parenting behavior and functioning have also been examined as predictors of  trajectories of early problem behavior, and some data support the interaction of  parenting and self-regulation as significant predictors of patterns of  problematic behavior and ongoing problems with the regulation of affect. Peer  relationships also affect and are affected by early self-regulation skills, and  both may play a role in academic performance and subsequent school success.  These data provide evidence that the social contexts of early family and peer  relationships are important moderators of the more proximal mechanism of  self-regulation, and both types of processes, social and biobehavioral, are  likely implicated in early antisocial tendencies. Implications of these findings  on self-regulation and early behavior problems are discussed in terms of future  research and treatment approaches.

Changing dynamics in problematic personality: a multiwave longitudinal study of  the relationship between shyness and aggressiveness from childhood to early  adulthood.	Hutteman R(1), Denissen JJ, Asendorpf JB, van Aken MA.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Humboldt University-Berlin, Unter den Linden 6,  Berlin D-10099, Germany, USA.	The present longitudinal study investigated cascade effects linking the  longitudinal trajectories of shyness and aggressiveness between age 4 and 23 and  individual differences in this longitudinal relationship. Results demonstrated  that there were cascade effects from shyness to adjacent measures of  aggressiveness at three moments in time, and that the dynamics of these  relationships changed over time. Children who were shy at age 6 became less  aggressive at age 7 and the same effect was found between age 8 and age 10. From  adolescence to early adulthood, the direction of the relationship changed and  shy adolescents at age 17 became increasingly aggressive 5 years later.  Interindividual differences were found in the latter cascade effect in that  shyness at age 17 only predicted an increase in aggressiveness at age 23 for  adolescents receiving low levels of support from their parents and for  adolescents spending little time in part-time work. Together, findings suggest  the importance of examining the development of normal variations in personality  and personality disorders from a developmental perspective and taking into  account person-environment interactions.

Author information: (1)Laboratory of Neurobiology of Temperament and Personality, Department of  Human Development, G22 MVR Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.  rad5@cornell.edu	A dimensional model of personality disturbance is presented that is defined by  extreme values on interacting subsets of seven major personality traits. Being  at the extreme has marked effects on the threshold for eliciting those traits  under stimulus conditions: that is, the extent to which the environment affects  the neurobiological functioning underlying the traits. To explore the nature of  development of extreme values on these traits, each trait is discussed in terms  of three major issues: (a) the neurobiological variables associated with the  trait, (b) individual variation in this neurobiology as a function of genetic  polymorphisms, and (c) the effects of environmental adversity on these  neurobiological variables through the action of epigenetic processes. It is  noted that gene-environment interaction appears to be dependent on two main  factors: (a) both genetic and environmental variables appear to have the most  profound and enduring effects when they exert their effects during early  postnatal periods, times when the forebrain is undergoing exuberant  experience-expectant dendritic and axonal growth; and (b) environmental effects  on neurobiology are strongly modified by individual differences in "traitlike"  functioning of neurobiological variables. A model of the nature of the  interaction between environmental and neurobiological variables in the  development of personality disturbance is presented.

Representations of the caregiver-child relationship and of the self, and emotion  regulation in the narratives of young children whose mothers have borderline  personality disorder.	Macfie J(1), Swan SA.	Author information: (1)University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996-0900, USA. macfie@utk.edu	Borderline personality disorder (BPD) represents a severe distortion in the  development of attachment, self, and emotion regulation. Study of children at  high risk of developing BPD may inform precursors to BPD. In a low socioeconomic  status sample of 30 children aged 4-7 whose mothers have BPD and 30 normative  comparisons, representations of the caregiver-child relationship and of the  self, and emotion regulation were assessed with a story-stem completion measure.  In contrast to comparisons and controlling for major depressive disorder,  children whose mothers have BPD told stories with the following: (a) more  parent-child role reversal, more fear of abandonment, and more negative  mother-child and father-child relationship expectations; (b) more incongruent  and shameful representations of the self; and (c) poorer emotion regulation  indicated by more confusion of boundaries between fantasy and reality and  between self and fantasy, more fantasy proneness, less narrative coherence, and  marginally more intrusion of traumatic themes. In the sample as a whole, (a) a  maladaptive caregiver-child relationship composite was associated with maternal  identity disturbance and self-harm; (b) a maladaptive self-composite was  associated with maternal self-harm; and (c) a maladaptive emotion regulation  composite was associated with maternal identity disturbance, negative  relationships, and self-harm. Results are discussed in terms of putative  precursors to BPD and preventive interventions.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409000534 PMCID: PMC2825084 PMID: 19583894 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Adolescent attachment and trajectories of hostile-impulsive behavior:  implications for the development of personality disorders.	Kobak R(1), Zajac K, Smith C.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, USA.  rkobak@psych.udel.edu	Adolescents' trajectories of impulsive and hostile behaviors provide a dynamic  index of risk for the emergence of Cluster B (antisocial and borderline)  personality disorders in early adulthood. In the current study, we tested the  hypothesis that preoccupied states of mind in the Adult Attachment Interview  would increase both the level and rate of growth in adolescents' trajectories of  aggressive and sexual risk-taking behaviors measured at ages 13, 15, and 17.  Overall, preoccupied states of mind predicted higher levels of sexual risk  taking and aggressive behaviors across all three assessments as well as higher  rates of growth in sexual-risk taking and caregiver-reported aggression over  time. In addition, preoccupied females showed slower rates of decline in  self-reported hostile emotions than did preoccupied males. The effects of gender  as a moderator of the relations between preoccupied status and risk trajectories  for personality disorders are discussed.

Kobak R(1), Zajac K, Levine S.	Author information: (1)Roger Kobak, Department of Psychology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE  19716, USA. rkobak@udel.edu	This study examines the relation between adolescents' antisocial behaviors and  adrenocortical activity during a laboratory visit in a sample of economically  disadvantaged families (N = 116, ages 12-14, 51% female). Pretask cortisol  levels indexed adolescents' prechallenge response to the lab visit, whereas  adolescents' response to a conflict discussion with their caregivers was indexed  with residualized change in pre- to postconflict cortisol levels. A trait  measure of antisocial behavior (derived from parent, teacher, and self-reports)  was associated with lower pretask cortisol levels but greater cortisol response  to the conflict discussion. Gender moderated antisocial adolescents' cortisol  response to the conflict discussion with girls who reported more covert risky  problem behaviors showing an increased cortisol response. The findings suggest  that, although antisocial adolescents had lower pretask cortisol levels,  conflict discussions with caregivers present a unique challenge to antisocial  girls compared with antisocial boys.

Inhibitory deficits in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder:  intentional versus automatic mechanisms of attention.	Fillmore MT(1), Milich R, Lorch EP.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506-0044,  USA. fillmore@uky.edu	Application of theoretically based tasks to the study of the development of  selective attention has led to intriguing new findings concerning the role of  inhibitory mechanisms. This study examined inhibitory mechanisms using a  countermanding task and an inhibition of return task to compare deficits in  intentionally, versus reflexively, controlled inhibition of attention in  children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Fifty children with  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were classified into one of  three subtypes: predominantly inattentive (ADHD/PI), combined (ADHD/C), and  those children with ADHD/C who also met criteria for comorbid oppositional  defiant disorder (ADHD/C + ODD). The groups were compared to a comparison group  of children (n = 21). The countermanding task showed that the ADHD groups  required more time to inhibit responses and this impairment did not differ among  subtypes. With respect to reflexively controlled inhibition, compared with  controls ADHD/C and ADHD/C + ODD groups showed impaired reflexive inhibition,  whereas the ADHD/PI group was considerably less impaired. The findings highlight  a dissociation between the two forms of inhibitory deficits among children with  the inattentive subtype, and raise the possibility that the efficient operation  of reflexive inhibitory mechanisms might be necessary for the development of  effective intentional control of inhibition.

Zielinski DS(1), Eckenrode J, Olds DL.	Author information: (1)Duke University, USA. dz17y@nih.gov	This study examined the effects of the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP), a program  of prenatal and infancy home visiting by nurses, on the timing of verified  reports of child maltreatment. A sample of predominantly unmarried, low-income  mothers and their first-born children were randomly assigned to receive either  home visitation services by nurses beginning in pregnancy and lasting until the  child was age 2, or comparison services. Previous studies have found that this  program was effective in reducing the overall number of substantiated Child  Protective Service reports by age 15. In the current study, survival analyses  were used to assess temporal differences between nurse visited (n = 93) and  comparison (n = 144) children's onset rates for maltreatment. The two groups'  survival functions remained nearly identical until age 4, at which point the  nurse-visited group's risk for onset began to significantly diminish. These  results were more pronounced among the highest risk subgroup and among victims  of neglect. The findings provide evidence that the NFP's success in reducing the  number of maltreatment reports resulted in part from in its impact on the timing  of the maltreatment process.

Emotion regulation strategies and later externalizing behavior among European  American and African American children.	Supplee LH(1), Skuban EM, Shaw DS, Prout J.	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh, USA. lauren.supplee@gmail.com	Children's early emotion regulation strategies (ERS) have been related to  externalizing problems; however, most studies have included predominantly  European American, middle-class children. The current study explores whether ERS  use may have differential outcomes as a function of the mother's ethnic culture.  The study utilizes two diverse samples of low-income male toddlers to examine  observed ERS during a delay of gratification task in relation to maternal and  teacher reports of children's externalizing behavior 2 to 6 years later.  Although the frequencies of ERS were comparable between ethnic groups in both  samples, the use of physical comfort seeking and self-soothing was positively  related to African American children's later externalizing behavior but  negatively related to externalizing behavior for European American children in  Sample 1. Data from Sample 2 appear to support this pattern for self-soothing in  maternal, but not teacher, report of externalizing behavior. Within group  differences by income were examined as a possible explanatory factor accounting  for the ethnic differences, but it was not supported. Alternative explanations  are discussed to explain the pattern of findings.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409000224 PMCID: PMC2712493 PMID: 19338690 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Teachers College, Columbia University. nansary@rider.edu	The main objectives of this study were to prospectively examine the relationship  between externalizing (substance use and delinquency) and internalizing  (depression and anxiety) dimensions and academic achievement (grades and  classroom adjustment), as well as continuity over time in these domains, within  a sample of wealthy adolescents followed from 10th to 12th grades (n = 256). In  both parts of the study, cluster analyses were used to group participants at  10th grade and then group differences were evaluated on adjustment outcomes over  time. In Part 1, problem behavior clusters revealed differences on academic  indices with the two marijuana using groups--marijuana users and multiproblem  youth--exhibiting the worst academic outcomes at all three waves. For Part 2,  the two lowest achieving groups reported the highest distress across all  externalizing dimensions over time. Stability across the three waves was found  for both personal and academic competence as well as the associations between  these two domains. Results are discussed in relation to intervention efforts  targeting wealthy students at risk.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409000182 PMCID: PMC4358764 PMID: 19144236 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

This commentary reviews and reflects on the studies of this special section:  studies that collectively provide compelling evidence for meaningful changes in  stress- and emotionally reactive psychophysiological systems with the transition  from middle childhood into adolescence. The observed changes were complex and  often overlaid upon ontogenetic differences in basal levels of activation of  these systems. Maturational increases in responsiveness to stressors were  stressor dependent and differentially expressed across autonomic and hormonal  measures. Pubertal status increased the impact of some affective valence  manipulations, although not significantly influencing others, including negative  affect-related potentiation of startle/reflexes. Such ontogenetic increases in  stressor and affect sensitivity may have implications for developmental  psychopathology. Developmental increases in stressor reactivity may normally aid  youth in responding adaptively to the challenges of adolescence, but may result  in stress dysregulation among at-risk adolescents, increasing further their  vulnerability for psychopathology. Pubertal-related increases in sensitivity to  emotionally laden stimuli may exacerbate individual predispositions for  exaggerated affective processing, perhaps contributing to the emergence of  psychological disorders in these youth. Together, these studies, with their  innovative use of autonomic, reflexive, and hormonal measures to index age- and  pubertal-related changes in reactivity to stressors and affective stimuli,  provide promising directions for future research. Some of these, along with a  few cautionary notes, are outlined.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409000066 PMCID: PMC3036838 PMID: 19144224 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Little is known about normative variation in stress response over the adolescent  transition. This study examined neuroendocrine and cardiovascular responses to  performance and peer rejection stressors over the adolescent transition in a  normative sample. Participants were 82 healthy children (ages 7-12 years, n =  39, 22 females) and adolescents (ages 13-17, n = 43, 20 females) recruited  through community postings. Following a habituation session, participants  completed a performance (public speaking, mental arithmetic, mirror tracing) or  peer rejection (exclusion challenges) stress session. Salivary cortisol,  salivary alpha amylase (sAA), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP),  and heart rate were measured throughout. Adolescents showed significantly  greater cortisol, sAA, SBP, and DBP stress response relative to children.  Developmental differences were most pronounced in the performance stress session  for cortisol and DBP and in the peer rejection session for sAA and SBP.  Heightened physiological stress responses in typical adolescents may facilitate  adaptation to new challenges of adolescence and adulthood. In high-risk  adolescents, this normative shift may tip the balance toward stress response  dysregulation associated with depression and other psychopathology. Specificity  of physiological response by stressor type highlights the importance of a  multisystem approach to the psychobiology of stress and may also have  implications for understanding trajectories to psychopathology.

Author information: (1)Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute, NY 10032, USA.	Functional imaging studies have reported with remarkable consistency  hyperactivity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex  (ACC), and caudate nucleus of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).  These findings have often been interpreted as evidence that abnormalities in  cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops involving the OFC and ACC are  causally related to OCD. This interpretation remains controversial, however,  because such hyperactivity may represent either a cause or a consequence of the  symptoms. This article analyzes the evidence for a causal role of these loops in  producing OCD in children and adults. The article first reviews the strong  evidence for anatomical abnormalities in these loops in patients with OCD. These  findings are not sufficient to establish causality, however, because anatomical  alterations may themselves be a consequence rather than a cause of the symptoms.  The article then reviews three lines of evidence that, despite their own  limitations, permit stronger causal inferences: the development of OCD following  brain injury, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with  streptococcal infection, and neurosurgical lesions that attenuate OCD.  Converging evidence from these various lines of research supports a causal role  for the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops that involve the OFC and  ACC in the pathogenesis of OCD in children and adults.

Author information: (1)Rutgers University, Newark, NJ 07102, USA.	The pursuit of rewarding experiences motivates everyday human behavior, and can  prove beneficial when pleasurable, positive consequences result (e.g.,  satisfying hunger, earning a paycheck). However, reward seeking may also be  maladaptive and lead to risky decisions with potentially negative long-term  consequences (e.g., unprotected sex, drug use). Such risky decision making is  often observed during adolescence, a time in which important structural and  functional refinements occur in the brain's reward circuitry. Although much of  the brain develops before adolescence, critical centers for goal-directed  behavior, such as frontal corticobasal ganglia networks, continue to mature.  These ongoing changes may underlie the increases in risk-taking behavior often  observed during adolescence. Further, typical development of these circuits is  vital to our ability to make well-informed decisions; atypical development of  the human reward circuitry can have severe implications, as is the case in  certain clinical and developmental conditions (e.g.,  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). This review focuses on current  research probing the neural correlates of reward-related processing across human  development supporting the current research hypothesis that immature or atypical  corticostriatal circuitry may underlie maladaptive behaviors observed in  adolescence.

Miklowitz DJ(1), Chang KD.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, CO  80309, USA. david.miklowitz@colorado.edu	This article examines how bipolar symptoms emerge during development, and the  potential role of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions in the  prevention of the onset of the disorder. Early signs of bipolarity can be  observed among children of bipolar parents and often take the form of  subsyndromal presentations (e.g., mood lability, episodic elation or  irritability, depression, inattention, and psychosocial impairment). However,  many of these early presentations are diagnostically nonspecific. The few  studies that have followed at-risk youth into adulthood find developmental  discontinuities from childhood to adulthood. Biological markers (e.g., amygdalar  volume) may ultimately increase our accuracy in identifying children who later  develop bipolar I disorder, but few such markers have been identified. Stress,  in the form of childhood adversity or highly conflictual families, is not a  diagnostically specific causal agent but does place genetically and biologically  vulnerable individuals at risk for a more pernicious course of illness. A  preventative family-focused treatment for children with (a) at least one  first-degree relative with bipolar disorder and (b) subsyndromal signs of  bipolar disorder is described.

Busch AL(1), Cowan PA, Cowan CP.	Author information: (1)Child Trauma Research Project, San Francisco General Hospital, Building 20,  Suite 2100, 1001 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA.  amy_busch@yahoo.com	This study examined links between the unresolved loss of a significant person  and current functioning in marital and parenting relationships. Participants  were 80 women who had experienced loss, their husbands, and their preschool  children. Unresolved loss was assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview, and  individual, marital, and parenting adaptation was assessed through videotaped  observations and women's self-reports. As predicted, women with unresolved loss  displayed less positive emotion and more anxiety and anger with both their  husbands and children, compared to women who were not unresolved. They also  displayed less authoritative and more authoritarian parenting styles with their  children. Yet unresolved women did not report more individual or relationship  difficulties, suggesting that direct observations are needed to assess the  implications of unresolved loss for family functioning.

Emotional difficulties in early adolescence following severe early deprivation:  findings from the English and Romanian adoptees study.	Colvert E(1), Rutter M, Beckett C, Castle J, Groothues C, Hawkins A, Kreppner J,  O'connor TG, Stevens S, Sonuga-Barke EJ.	Author information: (1)Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, University of London, Denmark Hill,  London, SE58AF UK. e.colvert@iop.kcl.ac.uk	The study assessed conduct and emotional difficulties in a group of Romanian  adoptees at age 11, and serves as a follow-up to assessments made when the  children were 6 years old. It was found that there was a significant increase in  emotional difficulties, but not conduct problems, for the Romanian sample since  age 6. It was also found that emotional difficulty was significantly more  prevalent at age 11 in the Romanian group than in a within-UK adoptee group.  Emotional difficulties in the Romanian adoptee group were found to be  significantly and strongly related to previous deprivation-specific problems  (disinhibited attachment, cognitive impairment, inattention/overactivity and  quasi-autism); however, the presence of such early problems did not account  fully for the onset of later emotional problems. Five contrasting hypotheses  concerning possible mediators for later onset of emotional difficulties for the  Romanian group were examined. No links were found to duration of deprivation or  other deprivation-related indices, stresses/difficulties in the postadoption  family environment, or educational attainment and self-esteem. There was some  evidence that emotion recognition might play a role in the emergence of these  problems, but other measures of social competence and theory of mind showed no  associations with the onset of emotional problems.

Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2008 Fall;20(4):1351.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether children with a history of  disorganized attachment in infancy were more likely than children without a  history of disorganized attachment to exhibit symptoms of posttraumatic stress  disorder (PTSD) at school age following trauma exposure. The sample consisted of  78 8.5-year-old children from a larger, ongoing prospective study evaluating the  effects of intrauterine cocaine exposure (IUCE) on children's growth and  development from birth to adolescence. At the 12-month visit, children's  attachment status was scored from videotapes of infant-caregiver dyads in  Ainsworth's strange situation. At the 8.5-year visit, children were administered  the Violence Exposure Scale-Revised, a child-report trauma exposure inventory,  and the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents by an experienced  clinical psychologist masked to children's attachment status and IUCE status.  Sixteen of the 78 children (21%) were classified as  insecure-disorganized/insecure-other at 12 months. Poisson regressions covarying  IUCE, gender, and continuity of maternal care indicated that disorganized  attachment status at 12 months, compared with nondisorganized attachment status,  significantly predicted both higher avoidance cluster PTSD symptoms and higher  reexperiencing cluster PTSD symptoms. These findings suggest that the quality of  early dyadic relationships may be linked to differences in children's later  development of posttraumatic stress symptoms following a traumatic event.

Murray J(1), Farrington DP.	Author information: (1)University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. jm335@cam.ac.uk	Qualitative studies suggest that children react to parental imprisonment by  developing internalizing as well as externalizing behaviors. However, no  previous study has examined the effects of parental imprisonment on children's  internalizing problems using standardized instruments, appropriate comparison  groups, and long-term follow-up. Using prospective longitudinal data from the  Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development, we compared boys separated because of  parental imprisonment during their first 10 years of life with four control  groups: boys who did not experience separation, boys separated because of  hospitalization or death, boys separated for other reasons (usually parental  disharmony), and boys whose parents were only imprisoned before the boys'  births. Individual, parenting, and family risk factors for internalizing  problems were measured when boys were ages 8-11 years. Separation because of  parental imprisonment predicted boys' internalizing problems from age 14 to 48,  even after controlling for childhood risk factors including parental  criminality. Separation because of parental imprisonment also predicted the  co-occurrence of internalizing and antisocial problems. These results suggest  that parental imprisonment might cause long-lasting internalizing and antisocial  problems for children.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579408000138 PMID: 18211738 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Do maternal attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms exacerbate or  ameliorate the negative effect of child attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  symptoms on parenting?	Psychogiou L(1), Daley DM, Thompson MJ, Sonuga-Barke EJ.	Author information: (1)University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.	The impact of similarity in parent and child characteristics on the quality of  parenting is underresearched. The current study examined the interaction between  mother and child attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms on  parenting. Two hypotheses were tested: the similarity-fit hypothesis, which  predicted that parent and child similarity will improve parenting, and the  similarity-misfit hypothesis, which predicted the opposite. Study 1 examined the  associations between maternal and child ADHD symptoms and child-specific rearing  attitudes of 95 mothers with school-aged children. In Study 2 this analysis was  extended to more objective observer-rated mother-child interaction and maternal  expressed emotion in 192 mothers of preschool children. Child ADHD symptoms were  associated with negative maternal comments and maternal ADHD symptoms with  negative expressed emotion. In both studies maternal ADHD symptoms appeared to  ameliorate the effects of child ADHD symptoms on negative parenting. Parental  response to children with high ADHD symptoms was more positive and affectionate  when the mother also had high ADHD symptoms. The results support the  similarity-fit hypothesis and highlight the importance of considering both child  and maternal ADHD symptoms in studies of parenting.

Author information: (1)University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. kate.nation@psy.ox.ac.uk	Children with autism are developmentally delayed in following the direction of  another person's gaze in social situations. A number of studies have measured  reflexive orienting to eye gaze cues using Posner-style laboratory tasks in  children with autism. Some studies observe normal patterns of cueing, suggesting  that children with autism are alert to the significance of the eyes, whereas  other studies reveal an atypical pattern of cueing. We review this contradictive  evidence to consider the extent to which sensitivity to gaze is normal, and ask  whether apparently normal performance may be a consequence of atypical  (nonsocial) mechanisms. Our review concludes by highlighting the importance of  adopting a developmental perspective if we are to understand the reasons why  people with autism process eye gaze information atypically.

Irons DE(1), McGue M, Iacono WG, Oetting WS.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, 75 East River Road,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. iron0012@umn.edu	To determine if drinking behavior in adolescence provides a "gateway" leading to  the misuse of other psychoactive substances and antisocial behavior, we  genotyped 180 Asian adolescent adoptees to determine if they inherited the  deficient from of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) enzyme that is important  in the metabolism of alcohol. Based on the gateway model, we hypothesized that  those with normal enzyme activity (70% of the sample) who began to misuse  alcohol would also misuse other drugs and display antisocial tendencies. Those  with the enzyme deficiency (30%), because they experience unpleasant side  effects associated with drinking, were expected to show less evidence of alcohol  misuse and thus be less likely to progress to the misuse of other substances or  engage in antisocial acts. Consistent with previous research, we found that  ALDH2 deficiency was significantly associated with lower rates of drinking and  getting drunk but not with ever having tried alcohol. Contrary to the gateway  model, we found no evidence that ALDH2 deficiency was associated with lower  rates of nonalcohol substance use or antisociality. Finally, in an examination  of factors that may moderate the impact of the metabolic protection because of  ALDH2 deficiency, we identified siblings rather than parents as the major source  of familial environmental effect on adolescent drinking.

Author information: (1)US National Institute of Mental Health, 15K, North Drive, Bethesda, MD  20892-2670, USA. lauj@mail.nih.gov	Consistent evidence shows both genetic and stress-related risks on child and  adolescent anxiety, yet few studies have considered the degree to which genetic  effects are moderated by stress (gene-environment interaction). We used  longitudinal data from both a child and adolescent sample of twins to examine  three novel issues on the presence of gene-environment interaction on anxiety  symptoms. First, we assessed moderation of genetic risks on anxiety symptoms by  negative life events in each age group. Second, by distinguishing between  "stable" and "age-specific" genetic factors, we explored the continuity of  gene-environment interaction across time and/or its emergence at specific ages.  Third, we compared the presence of gene-environment interaction across different  symptom types (general, panic, social, and separation). Genetic effects on  separation anxiety symptoms in childhood (mean age = 8 years, 6 months) and  panic anxiety symptoms in adolescence (mean age = 15 years) increased across  independent negative life events. Shared environmental effects on separation  anxiety symptoms and non shared environmental effects on general anxiety  symptoms in adolescence were also moderated by negative life events. We  interpret these preliminary findings tentatively in the context of  gene-environment interaction on anxiety in general, and on early separation and  later panic anxiety in particular.

Maximizing resilience through diverse levels of inquiry: Prevailing paradigms,  possibilities, and priorities for the future.	Luthar SS(1), Brown PJ.	Author information: (1)Department of Counseling and Clinical PsychologyColumbia University Teachers'  College, New York, NY 10027-6696, USA. luthar@tc.edu	The study of resilience has two core characteristics: it is fundamentally  applied in nature, seeking to use scientific knowledge to maximize well-being  among those at risk, and it draws on expertise from diverse scientific  disciplines. Recent advances in biological processes have confirmed the profound  deleterious effects of harsh caregiving environments, thereby underscoring the  importance of early interventions. What remains to be established at this time  is the degree to which insights on particular biological processes (e.g.,  involving specific brain regions, genes, or hormones) will be applied in the  near future to achieve substantial reductions in mental health disparities.  Aside from biology, resilience developmental researchers would do well to draw  upon relevant evidence from other behavioral sciences as well, notably  anthropology as well as family, counseling, and social psychology. Scientists  working with adults and with children must remain vigilant to the advances and  missteps in each others' work, always ensuring caution in conveying messages  about the "innateness" of resilience or its prevalence across different  subgroups. Our future research agenda must prioritize reducing abuse and neglect  in close relationships; deriving the "critical ingredients" in effective  interventions and going to scale with these; working collaboratively to refine  theory on the construct; and responsibly, proactively disseminating what we have  learned about the nature, limits, and antecedents of resilient adaptation across  diverse at-risk groups.

Resilience refers to the ability to successfully adapt to stressors, maintaining  psychological well-being in the face of adversity. Recent years have seen a  great deal of research into the neurobiological and psychological factors and  mechanisms that characterize resilient individuals. This article draws from that  research to outline some of the most important contributors to resilience. The  authors hope that by contributing to a growing understanding of the genetic,  developmental, neurobiological, and psychological underpinnings of resilience,  researchers and clinicians in the field will move closer toward the goal of  identifying and treating individuals at risk for developing posttraumatic  psychopathology.

Resilience among children and adolescents at risk for depression: Mediation and  moderation across social and neurobiological contexts.	Silk JS(1), Vanderbilt-Adriance E, Shaw DS, Forbes EE, Whalen DJ, Ryan ND, Dahl  RE.	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA. silkj@upmc.edu	This article offers a multilevel perspective on resilience to depression, with a  focus on interactions among social and neurobehavioral systems involved in  emotional reactivity and regulation. We discuss models of cross-contextual  mediation and moderation by which the social context influences or modifies the  effects of resilience processes at the biological level, or the biological  context influences or modifies the effects of resilience processes at the social  level. We highlight the socialization of emotion regulation as a candidate  process contributing to resilience against depression at the social context  level. We discuss several factors and their interactions across levels-including  genetic factors, stress reactivity, positive affect, neural systems of reward,  and sleep-as candidate processes contributing to resilience against depression  at the neurobehavioral level. We then present some preliminary supportive  findings from two studies of children and adolescents at high risk for  depression. Study 1 shows that elevated neighborhood level adversity has the  potential to constrain or limit the benefits of protective factors at other  levels. Study 2 indicates that ease and quickness in falling asleep and a  greater amount of time in deep Stage 4 sleep may be protective against the  development of depressive disorders for children. The paper concludes with a  discussion of clinical implications of this approach.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579407000417 PMID: 17705905 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Sensitive, stimulating caregiving predicts cognitive and behavioral resilience  in neurodevelopmentally at-risk infants.	Jaffee SR(1).	Author information: (1)Departmnet of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104,  USA. srjaffee@psych.upenn.edu	Although neurodevelopmental impairment is a risk factor for poor cognitive and  behavioral outcomes, associations between early and later functioning are only  moderate in magnitude, and it is likely that other factors intervene to modify  this trajectory. The current study tested the hypothesis that sensitive,  stimulating caregiving would promote positive behavioral and cognitive outcomes  among children who were at risk based on the results of a neurodevelopmental  screener and a temperament inventory. The sample comprised 1,720 infants and  toddlers from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, a  longitudinal study of children who were involved with child welfare services.  Children were first assessed between 3 and 24 months of age and subsequently 18  months later. Children who experienced improvements in the amount of sensitive,  stimulating caregiving they received had positive cognitive and behavioral  outcomes 18 months later, despite early levels of neurodevelopmental risk. The  association between changes in caregiving quality and changes in children's  functioning was stronger for children who were removed from the care of their  biological parents before the follow-up assessment than for children who  remained in the care of biological parents, suggesting a causal role for  caregiving quality on children's outcomes.

Effective treatment for postpartum depression is not sufficient to improve the  developing mother-child relationship.	Forman DR(1), O'Hara MW, Stuart S, Gorman LL, Larsen KE, Coy KC.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  david.forman@concordia.ca	Maternal depression is prevalent, and puts children at risk. Little evidence  addresses whether treatment for maternal depression is sufficient to improve  child outcomes. An experiment was conducted testing whether psychotherapeutic  treatment for mothers, suffering from major depression in the postpartum period,  would result in improved parenting and child outcomes. Participants included  depressed women randomly assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy (n = 60) or to  a waitlist (n = 60), and a nondepressed comparison group (n = 56). At 6 months,  depressed mothers were less responsive to their infants, experienced more  parenting stress, and viewed their infants more negatively than did nondepressed  mothers. Treatment affected only parenting stress, which improved significantly  but was still higher than that for nondepressed mothers. Eighteen months later,  treated depressed mothers still rated their children lower in attachment  security, higher in behavior problems, and more negative in temperament than  nondepressed mothers. Initial response to treatment did not predict reduced risk  for poor child outcomes. Early maternal negative perceptions of the child  predicted negative temperament and behavior problems 18 months after treatment.  Treatment for depression in the postpartum period should target the  mother-infant relationship in addition to the mothers' depressive symptoms.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI  48824-1116, USA. martelmi@msu.edu	This study first examined the respective relations of resiliency and reactive  control with executive functioning. It then examined the relationship of these  different domains to the development of academic and social outcomes, and to the  emergence of internalizing and externalizing problem behavior in adolescence.  Resiliency and reactive control were assessed from preschool to adolescence in a  high-risk sample of boys and girls (n = 498) and then linked to component  operations of neuropsychological executive functioning (i.e., response  inhibition, interference control, fluency, working memory/set-shifting,  planning, and alertness), assessed in early and late adolescence. Consistent,  linear relations were found between resiliency and executive functions (average  r = .17). A curvilinear relationship was observed between reactive control and  resiliency, such that resiliency was weaker when reactive control was either  very high or very low. In multivariate, multilevel models, executive functions  contributed to academic competence, whereas resiliency and interference control  jointly predicted social competence. Low resiliency, low reactive control, and  poor response inhibition uniquely and additively predicted internalizing problem  behavior, whereas low reactive control and poor response inhibition uniquely  predicted externalizing problem behavior. Results are discussed in relation to  recent trait models of regulation and the scaffolded development of competence  and problems in childhood and adolescence.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona  85287-1104, USA. nancy.eisenberg@asu.edu	The purpose of the study was to examine the zero-order and unique relations of  effortful attentional and behavioral regulation, reactive impulsivity, and  anger/frustration to Chinese first and second graders' internalizing and  externalizing symptoms, as well as the prediction of adjustment from the  interaction of anger/frustration and effortful control or impulsivity. A parent  and teacher reported on children's anger/frustration, effortful control, and  impulsivity. Parents reported on children's internalizing symptoms, and teachers  and peers reported on children's externalizing symptoms. Children were  classified as relatively high on externalizing (or comorbid), internalizing, or  nondisordered. High impulsivity and teacher-reported anger/frustration, and low  effortful control, were associated with externalizing problems, whereas low  effortful control and high parent-reported anger were predictive of  internalizing problems. Unique prediction from effortful and reactive control  was obtained and these predictors (especially when reported by teachers) often  interacted with anger/frustration when predicting problem behavior  classification.

Sterba SK(1), Prinstein MJ, Cox MJ.	Author information: (1)L. L. Thurstone Psychometric Laboratory, Department of Psychology, University  of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-3270, USA.  ssterba@email.unc.edu	Developmental psychopathology theory speaks to the existence of  early-manifesting internalizing problems with a heterogeneous longitudinal  course. However, the course of internalizing problems has been investigated  largely from late childhood onward, with methods that assume children's problem  trajectories vary more so in rate than in qualitative functional form. This can  obscure heterogeneity in symptom process and course, obscure onset of early  gender differences in internalizing problems, and obscure the relevance of early  sociocontextual risks for long-term internalizing outcomes. The present study  addressed these issues by using person-oriented (latent growth mixture) methods  to model heterogeneity in maternal-reported internalizing symptoms from age 2 to  11 years (N = 1,364). Three latent trajectory classes were supported for each  gender: two-thirds of children followed a low-stable trajectory; smaller  proportions followed decreasing/increasing or elevated-stable trajectories.  Although the number, shape, and predictive validity of internalizing trajectory  classes were similar across gender, trajectory classes' initial values and rates  of change varied significantly across gender, as did the impact of maternal  postpartum depression and anxiety on latent growth factors. Extracted latent  trajectories were differentially predicted by postpartum maternal  psychopathology, and themselves, in several respects, differentially predicted  self-reported depressive symptoms in preadolescence. However, discussion focuses  on the need for further external validation of extracted latent classes.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579407070174 PMID: 17459174 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Box 133, West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA.  suniya.luthar@columbia.edu	The purpose of this study was to ascertain the effectiveness of the Relational  Psychotherapy Mothers' Group (RPMG), a supportive parenting group intervention  for substance abusing women. Sixty mothers receiving RPMG were compared to 67  women receiving recovery training (RT); both treatments supplemented treatment  in the methadone clinics. At the end of the 6-month treatment period, RPMG  mothers showed marginally significant improvement on child maltreatment  (self-reported) and cocaine abuse based on urinalyses when compared with RT  mothers; notably, children of RPMG mothers reported significantly greater  improvement in emotional adjustment and depression than children of RT mothers.  At 6 months follow-up, however, treatment gains were no longer apparent.  Overall, the findings suggest that whereas supportive parenting interventions  for substance abusing women do have some preventive potential, abrupt cessation  of the therapeutic program could have deleterious consequences.

Murray-Close D(1), Ostrov JM, Crick NR.	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, USA. murr0139@umn.edu	Trajectories of relational aggression were examined in a large, diverse sample  of fourth-grade students. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine  relational aggression over 1 calendar year. The results indicated that  relational aggression increased in a linear fashion for girls over the course of  the study. In addition, increases in friend intimate exchange were associated  with time-dependent increases in relational aggression among girls only.  Relational aggression and internalizing "tracked" together across the course of  the study. Overall, the findings suggest relational aggression becomes  increasingly common among elementary school girls, and girls' close, dyadic  relationships may fuel relationally aggressive behavior in some contexts.

Author information: (1)Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, South Parks  Road, Oxford OX1 3UD, United Kingdom. jon.brock@psy.ox.ac.uk	Williams syndrome is a rare genetic disorder in which, it is claimed, language  abilities are relatively strong despite mild to moderate mental retardation.  Such claims have, in turn, been interpreted as evidence either for modular  preservation of language or for atypical constraints on cognitive development.  However, this review demonstrates that there is, in fact, little evidence that  syntax, morphology, phonology, or pragmatics are any better than predicted by  nonverbal ability, although performance on receptive vocabulary tests is  relatively good. Similarly, claims of an imbalance between good phonology and  impaired or atypical lexical semantics are without strong support. There is,  nevertheless, consistent evidence for specific deficits in spatial language that  mirror difficulties in nonverbal spatial cognition, as well as some tentative  evidence that early language acquisition proceeds atypically. Implications for  modular and neuroconstructivist accounts of language development are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457940707006X PMID: 17241486 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Garner PW(1), Lemerise EA.	Author information: (1)George Mason University, New Century College, 4400 University Drive, Fairfax,  VA 22030-4444, USA. pgarner1@gmu.edu	Ninety-four low- and middle-income preschoolers (48 boys, 46 girls) were  recruited from two sites in a large southwestern city. Children's positive  attributions of peer intent, social problem-solving decisions, and attributions  of peers' feelings about the provocation were evaluated from individual  interviews. In addition, children's anger perception accuracy and their global  emotion situation knowledge were assessed. Teachers and their assistants  reported on the children's social competence, internalizing and externalizing  behavior, and the degree to which children were physically and relationally  victimized. Social competence was a negative predictor of relational and  physical victimization, and externalizing behavior was a positive predictor of  both types of victimization. Anger perception accuracy was negatively related to  physical victimization, and global emotion situation knowledge and attributions  of sorrow to provoking peers were positive predictors. Results support a  conceptual framework that emphasizes the importance of social and  emotion-related social cognitive variables for understanding young children's  peer-related victimization.

Author information: (1)University of Montreal, School of Psychoeducation, C.P. 6128 Succursale  Centreville, Montréal, Québec H3C 3J7, Canada. sylvana.cote@umontreal.ca	A person-oriented approach was adopted to examine joint developmental  trajectories of physical and indirect aggression. Participants were 1183  children aged 2 years at the initial assessment and followed over 6 years. Most  children followed either low or declining trajectories of physical aggression  (PA), but 14.6% followed high stable trajectories. Approximately two-thirds of  participants followed low indirect aggression (IA) trajectories (67.9%), and  one-third (32.1%) followed high rising trajectories. The results combining both  PA and IA group memberships indicate that most children (62.1%) exhibit  desisting levels of PA and low levels of IA. A significant proportion followed a  trajectory of moderately desisting PA and rising IA (14.2%), and 13.5% followed  high level trajectories of both forms of aggression. Virtually no children were  high on one type and low on the other. Multinomial regressions analyses were  used to predict joint trajectory group membership from selected child and family  variables measured at 2 years. Young motherhood and low income predicted  membership in the high PA-high IA trajectory, but only hostile parenting  remained significant after family processes variables were entered in the model.  Being a boy, young motherhood, and hostile parenting were generally associated  with higher levels of PA. Girls were more likely than boys to follow a  trajectory of desisting PA and rising IA. The results suggest that some  children, mostly girls, reduce their use of PA and tend to increase their use of  IA, and that highly physically aggressive children also tend to be highly  indirectly aggressive. Early family risk characteristics and hostile parenting  interfere with the socialization of aggression.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579407070034 PMID: 17241483 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Feldman R(1), Masalha S.	Author information: (1)Bar-Ilan University, Israel. Feldman@mail.biu.ac.il	To examine the effects of risk on infant development within cultural contexts,  141 dual-earner Israeli and Palestinian couples and their first-born child were  observed at 5 months and again at 34 months. Eight ecological determinants were  examined as potential risk factors, including the infant's observed and  parent-reported difficult temperament; the mother's depressive symptoms,  work-family interference, and experience of childbirth; the parents' marital  satisfaction and social support; and observed maternal and paternal sensitivity.  Symbolic play and behavior problems were assessed at 34 months. Culture-specific  effects of risk and protective factors were found. Parent sensitivity  facilitated symbolic competence to a greater extent in the Israeli group.  Culture moderated the effects of maternal depression and family social support  on toddlers' behavior problems. Maternal depressive symptoms had a negative  impact on the behavior adaptation of Israeli children and social support  buffered against behavior problems in the Arab group. Implications for research  on risk and resilience and the role of culture in moderating the effects of  ecological risk are discussed.

Author information: (1)Division of Epidemiology, Services, and Prevention Research, National  Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-9589,  USA. mglantz@nida.nih.gov	Research has shown that both prenatal alcohol and tobacco exposure are  associated with increased risk of significant adverse medical, developmental,  and behavioral outcomes including substance abuse. Research on the outcomes of  prenatal exposure to illicit drugs (PNDE) has also found increased physical and  behavioral problems for gestationally drug-exposed children. However, a clear  picture has not emerged on whether the consequences of PNDE are independent from  those associated with having a substance abusing parent and whether PNDE  increases vulnerability to drug abuse. Because of its typical co-occurrence with  factors inherent in having a drug-abusing parent, PNDE is at least a marker of  significant increased risk for a range of negative outcomes including greater  vulnerability to substance abuse. Although a review of the relevant research  literatures indicates that the direct consequences of PNDE appear to be  generally both subtle and nonglobal, PNDE does appear to have negative  developmental and behavioral outcomes, and there is evidence that it is a modest  direct contributor to increased substance abuse vulnerability.

The impact of maltreatment-related sequelae (including dissociation and  depression) on basic memory processes as well as false memories and  suggestibility are also outlined. Although there is a clear need for additional  research, the investigations that do exist reveal that maltreated children's  basic memory processes are not reliably different from that of other,  nonmaltreated children.

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.  gunnar@umn.edu	A major focus in developmental psychopathology is on understanding developmental  mechanisms and, armed with this information, intervening to improve children's  outcomes. Translational research attempts to bridge the distance between  understanding and intervention. In the collaborations that have formed the core  of our research network on early experience, stress, and prevention science, we  have focused on translating basic research on early experiences and stress  neurobiology into preventive interventions for neglected and abused children.  Our experiences in attempting to move from bench to bedside have led us to  recognize the many challenges that face translational researchers. This review  provides a brief synopsis of the animal model literature on early experience and  stress neurobiology from which we glean several key bridging issues. We then  review what is currently known about the impact of childhood neglect and abuse  on stress neurobiology in human adults and children. Next, we describe how this  work has informed the evaluation of our preventive interventions with maltreated  children. Finally, we discuss several considerations that should facilitate a  more complete integration of basic research on early experience and stress  neurobiology into preventive intervention strategies.

Author information: (1)Ohio State University, Coumbus, OH 32101-1250, USA. Fristad.1@osu.edu	Bipolar disorder (BPD) has received increasing attention from public and  professional sources. Although pharmacologic treatments are considered the sine  qua non in the treatment of youth with BPD, psychosocial interventions are  critical to assist the child and family cope with symptoms that carry with them  significant morbidity and mortality. Treatments developed to date are few in  number; all are psychoeducationally based, using cognitive-behavioral and family  systems interventions within a biopsychosocial framework. This paper reviews  possible mediators of outcome, including caregiver concordance, children's  social skills, hopelessness, and family stress. The author has developed two  family-based psychoeducational interventions for the treatment of youth with  BPD: multifamily psychoeducation groups (MFPG) and individual family  psychoeducation (IFP). These treatments are both described and the results from  a previously published randomized clinical trial (RCT) of MFPG are summarized.  Then, new findings from an RCT of IFP are presented, along with preliminary  pilot data from an expanded version of IFP. The paper concludes with  recommendations for future research.

There is increasing interest in the psychosocial variables that might predict  the course of child and adolescent bipolar disorder. In the literature on adult  bipolar disorder, life events have been shown to be a major predictor of  symptoms. In this review, we focus on studies of how life events influence the  course of child and adolescent bipolar disorder. To begin, we review  methodological considerations in life events research, and briefly summarize the  findings regarding life events in adult bipolar disorder. Then, we discuss  available studies on life events as a predictor of the course of juvenile  bipolar disorder. We conclude with suggested directions for future research.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.  luby@psychiatry.wustl.edu	The clinical characteristics and adaptive functioning of preschoolers who met  DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder versus psychiatric and healthy comparison  groups were investigated. A community-based sample of 303 preschoolers (3-6  years of age) and their caregivers was ascertained. Diagnostic classification  based on parent report of mania symptoms was made using an age-appropriate  psychiatric interview. Results indicated that 26 preschoolers met DSM-IV  criteria for bipolar disorder who could be identified based the presence of 13  core age-adjusted mania items. These children could be clearly differentiated  from children in two psychiatric groups (DSM-IV disruptive disorders, and major  depressive disorder) and a "healthy" comparison group based on a specific  symptom constellation. Findings indicated that preschoolers in the bipolar group  were significantly more (p < .05) impaired than the two psychiatric and healthy  groups based on independent measures. Further, even after controlling for  comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (81% comorbidity rate), the  bipolar group remained significantly (p < .05) more impaired in multiple domains  compared to preschoolers with DSM-IV disruptive disorders and healthy controls.  Findings suggested that children as young as 3 years can manifest DSM-IV bipolar  disorder when age adjusted symptom descriptions are employed, and that these  children can be distinguished from healthy and disruptive disordered  preschoolers. Recommendations for future research in this area that integrates  developmental and mental health models are made.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579406060482 PMID: 17064425 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Research Institute on Addictions, Buffalo, NY, USA. eedwards@ria.buffalo.edu	This study examined the relationship between paternal alcoholism and toddler  behavior problems from 18 to 36 months of age, as well as the potential  moderating effects of 12-month infant-mother attachment security on this  relationship. Children with alcoholic fathers had higher levels of internalizing  and externalizing behavior than children of nonalcoholic fathers. Simple effects  testing of an interaction effect of child age, group, and attachment security  with mothers on externalizing behaviour suggested that at 24 and 36 months of  age mother-infant attachment security moderated the relationship between alcohol  group status and externalizing behaviour. Namely, within the alcohol group,  those children with secure relationships with their mothers had significantly  lower externalizing than insecure children of alcoholics. A similar pattern was  noted for internalizing behavior at 36 months of age. Implications for  intervention are discussed.

Author information: (1)Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.  Richard.Okearney@anu.edu.au	This study compared the structure and quality of emotion language in adolescents  with externalizing disorders (N = 21), internalizing disorders (N = 18), and  without a behavioral or emotional disorder (N = 16). Emotion language was  elicited in response to vignette material prototypical for anger/sadness and  fear, to autobiographical experiences, and to an actual emotional challenge. The  findings reveal different emphases in the emotion language of internalizing and  externalizing youth rather than a relative weakness for externalizing  adolescents. Overall, clinical adolescents used fewer emotion terms that were  semantically specific for anger, sad, or fear than typical adolescents. The  results also show that emotion language is affected differentially for  externalizing and internalizing adolescents depending on the emotion domain.  Internalizing youth's emotion language to anger/sad events used inner-directed  terms, situational references, and reduced intensity while their representation  of emotions in response to salient threatening material was dominated by terms  with a cognitive focus. Externalizing adolescents' emotion language responses to  anger/sad events were more outer directed and intense, and their emotion  language in a salient threat situation more orientated to direct affective  terms. The results suggest that examining emotion language for specific emotion  domains in adolescents with specific disorders will better clarify the role of  emotion language in the regulation of emotions than approaches that globalize  emotion language competencies or deficits.

Predicting change in borderline personality: Using neurobehavioral systems  indicators within an individual growth curve framework.	Lenzenweger MF(1), Desantis Castro D.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, State University of New York at Binghamton, NY  13902, USA. mlenzen@binghamton.edu	The natural history and course of borderline personality disorder (BPD) has long  been the focus of speculation, typically guided by impressions from clinical  work with BPD-affected individuals. Not unlike the other personality disorders  (PDs), it has long been assumed that BPD is relatively stable, traitlike, and  enduring in nature. The extent to which BPD is or is not a plastic construct has  implications not only for understanding its longitudinal course, but also for  understanding its development and, ultimately, its treatment and/or prevention.  This paper consists of two parts. The first part reviews the longitudinal  research corpus that bears directly upon the issue of stability of BPD in both  adolescents and adults. The consistent trend in very nearly all studies, whether  using a categorical or dimensional approach to assessment, is one of  considerable change over time. This literature presents complexities, however,  because most of the extant studies examine BPD-affected individuals who have  been exposed to treatment. However, at least two large-scale longitudinal  studies, which include both treated and untreated persons, also provide support  for viewing BPD as a malleable disorder that declines in severity over time. The  second part presents original data from the Longitudinal Study of Personality  Disorders that specifically examine the predictors of change in BPD using a  neurobehavioral model of personality within an individual growth curve (IGC)  analytical framework. This IGC analysis revealed important predictors of both  overall level of BPD features as well as rate of change in BPD features, with  particularly important roles played by the agentic positive emotion (i.e.,  incentive motivation) and anxiety (negative emotion) systems. The benefits of  the IGC approach for understanding the developmental psychopathology of BPD is  also stressed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579405050571 PMID: 16613438 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI  48823-1116, USA. nigg@msu.edu	We review different conceptions of inhibitory control that may be relevant to  the regulatory problems featured in borderline personality disorder (BPD). These  conceptions have often been framed with regard to personality traits of  inhibitory control, but can also be related to cognitive measures of response  suppression as well as affect regulation. Reactive behavioral inhibition is  relatively unstudied in relation to BPD. A substantial amount of literature  links executive function problems with BPD, but that literature has not isolated  executive response inhibition nor been controlled for other personality disorder  symptoms of antisociality, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or  depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic symptoms. We therefore conducted a study  of this question looking at BPD symptoms in an adult sample with a small number  of BPD subjects and other disorders. Results indicated that symptoms of BPD were  correlated with response inhibition (measured by stop signal reaction time) even  after controlling for the overlap of stop inhibition with ADHD, antisociality,  and other Axis II disorder symptoms. We conclude by hypothesizing discrete  developmental routes to BPD, based on different mechanism breakdowns, which  would be amenable to empirical investigation at the cognitive or trait level of  analysis.

Crowell SE(1), Beauchaine TP, McCauley E, Smith CJ, Stevens AL, Sylvers P.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-1525,  USA. crowell@u.washington.edu	Although parasuicidal behavior in adolescence is poorly understood, evidence  suggests that it may be a developmental precursor of borderline personality  disorder (BPD). Current theories of both parasuicide and BPD suggest that  emotion dysregulation is the primary precipitant of self-injury, which serves to  dampen overwhelmingly negative affect. To date, however, no studies have  assessed endophenotypic markers of emotional responding among parasuicidal  adolescents. In the present study, we compare parasuicidal adolescent girls  (n=23) with age-matched controls (n=23) on both psychological and physiological  measures of emotion regulation and psychopathology. Adolescents, parents, and  teachers completed questionnaires assessing internalizing and externalizing  psychopathology, substance use, trait affectivity, and histories of parasuicide.  Psychophysiological measures including electrodermal responding (EDR),  respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP) were  collected at baseline, during negative mood induction, and during recovery.  Compared with controls, parasuicidal adolescents exhibited reduced respiratory  sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at baseline, greater RSA reactivity during negative mood  induction, and attenuated peripheral serotonin levels. No between-group  differences on measures of PEP or EDR were found. These results lend further  support to theories of emotion dysregulation and impulsivity in parasuicidal  teenage girls.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College, Hanover,  NH 03755, USA. abigail.a.baird@dartmouth.edu	Traditional theories regarding the etiology of borderline personality disorder  have focused on poor attachment figures and/or traumatic experience. The present  review posits an additional pathogenic course for this disorder. Specifically,  the proposed mechanism involves a basic disruption of the neural hardware that  supports the formation and maintenance of unconscious emotional memory, hardware  essential for the formation of early attachments. It is further theorized that  this early disruption has ongoing effects on both behavioral and concomitant  neural development. Within this model, adolescence is described as a period of  intense change that serves as the tipping point for the onset of borderline  personality disorder.

Author information: (1)Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology, Meliora Hall 479,  RC Box 270266, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA.  ryan@psych.rochester.edu	Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is considered as a disorder of autonomy,  and is related to both predisposing vulnerabilities and social relationships  that fail to support basic psychological needs. Autonomy, which is defined  within the self-determination theory as the capacity for self-endorsed action  based on integrative, reflective awareness, is discussed as a developmental line  that is dependent on specific supports from caregivers. Unresponsiveness,  invalidation, or abuse by caregivers is argued to impair the capacity for  autonomy and to catalyze an array of processes, both biological and  psychological, which impact subsequent development and, in vulnerable  individuals, can lead to BPD. Aspects of treatment, including the emphases on  validation and acceptance of the patient's experience, and the cultivation of  more reflective or mindful regulation of behavior, can be deduced, from this  analysis of autonomy disturbance, and these in turn have appeared as the  cornerstones of effective treatments for BPD.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA  16802, USA. klevy@psu.edu	Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a highly prevalent, chronic, and  debilitating psychiatric problem characterized by a pattern of chaotic and  self-defeating interpersonal relationships, emotional lability, poor impulse  control, angry outbursts, frequent suicidality, and self-mutilation. Recently,  psychopathology researchers and theorists have begun to understand fundamental  aspects of BPD such as unstable, intense interpersonal relationships, feelings  of emptiness, bursts of rage, chronic fears of abandonment and intolerance for  aloneness, and lack of a stable sense of self as stemming from impairments in  the underlying attachment organization. These investigators have noted that the  impulsivity, affective lability, and self-damaging actions that are the hallmark  of borderline personality occur in an interpersonal context and are often  precipitated by real or imagined events in relationships. This article reviews  attachment theory and research as a means of providing a developmental  psychopathology perspective on BPD. Following a brief review of Bowlby's theory  of attachment, and an overview of the evidence with respect to the major claims  of attachment theory, I discuss individual differences, the evidence that these  differences are rooted in patterns of interaction with caregivers, and how these  patterns have important implications for evolving adaptations and development.  Following this discussion, I present recent work linking attachment theory and  BPD, focusing on the implications for understanding the etiology and treatment  of BPD. In conclusion, I address some of the salient issues that point to the  direction for future research efforts.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579405050455 PMID: 16613426 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, MN, USA.  stephanie.meyer@cshs.org	In a previous paper, the authors found that impairment on the Wisconsin Card  Sorting Test (WCST) in adolescence was predictive of bipolar disorder in young  adulthood among offspring of mothers with bipolar illness. In the present study,  the authors explore the contribution of maternal characteristics, beyond  maternal mood disorder, to the prediction of offspring dysfunction on the WCST.  Results showed that maternal bipolar disorder and maternal negativity were both  predictive of impaired performance on the WCST during adolescence. The  contribution of maternal negativity to offspring WCST impairment was not better  explained by maternal personality disorder, mother's functional impairment,  family loading for bipolar disorder, or offspring disruptive behavioral  disturbance. Findings did not support a moderator model. However, support was  found for a mediation model in which maternal negativity contributed to risk for  offspring bipolar disorder through its negative association with apparent  frontal lobe functioning, as measured by the WCST. Findings are discussed from  the perspective of a vulnerability-stress model. In addition, the authors  consider the possibility that maternal negativity and offspring impairment on  the WCST may be reflective of a common heritable trait.

Author information: (1)Applied Psychology and Human Development Division, Graduate School of  Education, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.	Prior research suggests that exposure to elementary classrooms characterized by  high levels of student aggression may contribute to the development of child  aggressive behavior problems. To explore this process in more detail, this study  followed a longitudinal sample of 4,907 children and examined demographic  factors associated with exposure to high-aggression classrooms, including school  context factors (school size, student poverty levels, and rural vs. urban  location) and child ethnicity (African American, European American). The  developmental impact of different temporal patterns of exposure (e.g., primacy,  recency, chronicity) to high-aggression classrooms was evaluated on child  aggression. Analyses revealed that African American children attending large,  urban schools that served socioeconomically disadvantaged students were more  likely than other students to be exposed to high-aggressive classroom contexts.  Hierarchical regressions demonstrated cumulative effects for temporal exposure,  whereby children with multiple years of exposure showed higher levels of  aggressive behavior after 3 years than children with primacy, less recent, and  less chronic exposure, controlling for initial levels of aggression.  Implications are discussed for developmental research and preventive  interventions.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579406060251 PMCID: PMC2750030 PMID: 16600064 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Moss E(1), Smolla N, Cyr C, Dubois-Comtois K, Mazzarello T, Berthiaume C.	Author information: (1)Department of Pshychology, University of Quebec at Montreal, Canada.  moss.ellen@uqam.ca	The predictive relation between attachment and mother, teacher, and  self-reported psychopathology was examined for a diverse socioeconomic status  French Canadian sample of 96 children. Attachment classifications were assigned  on the basis of reunion behavior with mother when the children were  approximately 6 years old, and child problem behavior was assessed 2 years later  using the Child Behavior Checklist (mother report), the Social Behavior  Questionaire (teacher report), and the Dominic Questionnaire (child  self-report). Results indicated that both insecure/ambivalent and  insecure/controlling children children were rated higher than secure children on  a composite measure of externalizing problems. Concerning internalizing  problems, only the controlling group was significantly higher on both a  composite adult (teacher and mother) and self-report measure of internalizing  problems. Analyses of clinical cutoff scores showed that only the controlling  group had a significantly greater likelihood of overall problem behavior than  other children.

Lewis MD(1), Granic I.	Author information: (1)Department of Human Development and Applied Psychology, OISE/University of  Toronto, Ontario, Canada. mlewis@oise.otoronto.ca	The term self-organization has at least two meanings for developmental  psychopathologists: the spontaneous emergence of order in developing systems and  the consolidation of that part of the person called the self. The first meaning  is shared across the sciences at large, and it denotes a general model of change  and growth in complex systems. We review principles of self-organization from  the natural sciences and discuss their application to the study of human  development. We then suggest possible sources and consequences of terminological  confusion in developmental psychology and offer some potential resolutions. The  "self" in self-organization seems a special case of this confusion, and it can  be addressed by modeling the self as both autonomous agent and emergent form. We  outline preliminary directions for this modeling and then go on to a more  general discussion of how principles of self-organization can help bring  developmental psychopathology closer to its goals.

Pathways toward educational achievement among African American and Puerto Rican  adolescent mothers: reexamining the role of social support from families.	Way N(1), Leadbeater BJ.	Author information: (1)Department of Applied Psychology, New York University, New York, NY 10003,  USA.	Although a majority of adolescent mothers are graduating from high school, the  processes that enhance the educational attainment of adolescent mothers are not  well understood. With a sample of 93 African American and Puerto Rican  adolescent mothers, we assessed the effects of material support from family  (i.e., child care assistance from grandmother and residence with grandmother)  and emotional support from family over and above pre- and postpregnancy risk  factors (i.e., maternal age at first birth, delayed grade placement before  pregnancy, ethnicity, depressive symptoms, stressful life events, and repeat  pregnancy) during the first year postpartum on educational attainment at 6 years  postpartum. Significant contributors to the explained variance in educational  attainment included: delayed grade placement before pregnancy, maternal age at  first birth, depressive symptoms, emotional support from family, and residence  with grandmother. Unexpectedly, higher perceived emotional support from family  and living with grandmother predicted lower educational attainment. Post hoc  analysis of qualitative data suggested reasons for these latter findings and  point to the need to reconceptualize and broaden the elements of social support  that constitute protective factors for adolescent mothers.

Individuals with melancholic major depression exhibit basal hypercortisolism and  an attenuated ACTH response to exogenous corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)  infusion. Given the greater incidence of depression in children of depressed  parents, we examined the ACTH and cortisol responses to ovine CRH (oCRH)  infusion in 63 adolescent offspring of mothers with major depression, bipolar  illness, or no psychiatric illness. Psychiatric and observational assessments of  these families had been conducted over the course of 10 years preceding this  study. We examined the children's responses to CRH in relation to maternal  characteristics and family environment and found the following: (a) cortisol  responses were negatively related to chronic family stress and (b) offspring of  depressed mothers with an avoidant personality disorder showed an exaggerated  ACTH response. In addition, adolescents in late puberty (Tanner 4 and 5) had  lower ACTH and cortisol responses to oCRH infusion than those in early puberty.  Further, offspring with early histories of mood problems, and those who  developed major depressive disorder as young adults, did not exhibit basal  hypercortisolism but did show an attenuated ACTH response to CRH. Our results  add to the growing body of literature showing the influence of maternal  characteristics and environmental factors on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis  patterns in children.

Forbes EE(1), Dahl RE.	Author information: (1)Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15213,  USA. forbese@upmc.edu	From an affective neuroscience perspective, the goal of achieving a deeper, more  mechanistic understanding of the development of depression will require rigorous  models that address the core underlying affective changes. Such an understanding  will necessitate developing and testing hypotheses focusing on specific  components of the complex neural systems involved in the regulation of emotion  and motivation. In this paper, we illustrate these principles by describing one  example of this type of approach: examining the role of disruptions in neural  systems of positive affect in major depressive disorder in school-age children  and adolescents. We begin by defining positive affect, proposing that positive  affect can be distinguished from negative affect by its neurobehavioral  features. We provide an overview of neural systems related to reward and  positive affect, with a discussion of their potential involvement in depression.  We describe a developmental psychopathology framework, addressing developmental  issues that could play a role in the etiology and maintenance of early-onset  depression. We review the literature on altered positive affect in depression,  suggesting directions for future research. Finally, we discuss the treatment  implications of this framework.

Early adversity and mechanisms of plasticity: integrating affective neuroscience  with developmental approaches to psychopathology.	Pollak SD(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Wisconsin at Madison, 53706-8190,  USA. spollack@wisc.edu	Interest in the effects of early adversity on children's development reflects  contemporary emphases on early experience in the behavioral sciences and  plasticity in the neurosciences. Over the past decade, powerful new tools and  approaches for understanding the neural circuitry involved in emotion have  become increasingly available. Yet, research in developmental psychopathology  has not reaped the full benefits of affective neuroscience approaches and  methods. Integration of affective neuroscience approaches can excavate  developmental mechanisms, thereby advancing knowledge about the etiology,  prevention, and treatment of mental health problems in children. Here, we  consider two general principles that can guide understanding of plasticity in  the neural circuitry of emotion systems and the development of psychopathology.

Author information: (1)Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, School of Psychology, Birkbeck,  University of London, UK. mark.Johnson@bbk.ac.uk	Several research groups have identified a network of regions of the adult cortex  that are activated during social perception and cognition tasks. In this paper  we focus on the development of components of this social brain network during  early childhood and test aspects of a particular viewpoint on human functional  brain development: "interactive specialization." Specifically, we apply new data  analysis techniques to a previously published data set of event-related  potential (ERP) studies involving 3-, 4-, and 12-month-old infants viewing faces  of different orientation and direction of eye gaze. Using source separation and  localization methods, several likely generators of scalp recorded ERP are  identified, and we describe how they are modulated by stimulus characteristics.  We then review the results of a series of experiments concerned with perceiving  and acting on eye gaze, before reporting on a new experiment involving young  children with autism. Finally, we discuss predictions based on the atypical  emergence of the social brain network.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579405050297 PMCID: PMC1464100 PMID: 16262984 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Eisenhower Parkway, Suite 2A, Ann Arbor, MI 48108, USA. jjester@umich.edu	Inattention/hyperactivity and aggressive behavior problems were measured in 335  children from school entry throughout adolescence, at 3-year intervals. Children  were participants in a high-risk prospective study of substance use disorders  and comorbid problems. A parallel process latent growth model found aggressive  behavior decreasing throughout childhood and adolescence, whereas  inattentive/hyperactive behavior levels were constant. Growth mixture modeling,  in which developmental trajectories are statistically classified, found two  classes for inattention/hyperactivity and two for aggressive behavior, resulting  in a total of four trajectory classes. Different influences of the family  environment predicted development of the two types of behavior problems when the  other behavior problem was held constant. Lower emotional support and lower  intellectual stimulation by the parents in early childhood predicted membership  in the high problem class of inattention/hyperactivity when the trajectory of  aggression was held constant. Conversely, conflict and lack of cohesiveness in  the family environment predicted membership in a worse developmental trajectory  of aggressive behavior when the inattention/hyperactivity trajectories were held  constant. The implications of these findings for the development of  inattention/hyperactivity and for the development of risk for the emergence of  substance use disorders are discussed.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, 525 East University, Ann  Arbor, MI 48109, USA. slolson@umich.edu	Examined associations between effortful control temperament and externalizing  problems in 220 3-year-old boys and girls, controlling for co-occurring  cognitive and social risk factors. We also considered possible additive and/or  interactive contributions of child dispositional anger and psychosocial  adversity, and whether relations between effortful control and early  externalizing problems were moderated by child gender. Individual differences in  children's effortful control abilities, assessed using behavioral and parent  rating measures, were negatively associated with child externalizing problems  reported by mothers, fathers, and preschool teachers. These associations were  not overshadowed by other cognitive or social risk factors, or by other relevant  child temperament traits such as proneness to irritability. Further analyses  revealed that associations between externalizing problem behavior and effortful  control were specific to components of child problem behavior indexing  impulsive-inattentive symptoms. Thus, children's effortful control skills were  important correlates of children's early disruptive behavior, a finding that may  provide insight into the developmental origins of chronic behavioral  maladjustment.

Masten AS(1), Burt KB, Roisman GI, Obradović J, Long JD, Tellegen A.	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, USA. amasten@umn.edu	Patterns of continuity and change in competence and resilience over the  transition to adulthood were examined in relation to adversity and psychosocial  resources, with a focus on adaptive resources that may be particularly important  for this transition. Variable-focused and person-focused analyses drew on data  from the Project Competence longitudinal study of a school cohort followed over  20 years from childhood through emerging adulthood (EA) into the young adulthood  (YA) years with excellent retention (90%). Success in age-salient and emerging  developmental tasks from EA to YA was examined in a sample of 173 of the  original participants with complete data on adversity, competence, and key  resources. Regressions and extreme-group analyses indicated striking continuity  in competence and resilience, yet also predictable change. Success in  developmental tasks in EA and YA was related to core resources originating in  childhood (IQ, parenting quality, socioeconomic status) and also to a set of EA  adaptive resources that included planfulness/future motivation, autonomy, adult  support, and coping skills. EA adaptive resources had unique predictive  significance for successful transitions to adulthood, both overall and for the  small group of individuals whose pattern of adaptation changed dramatically from  maladaptive to resilient over the transition. Results are discussed in relation  to the possibility that the transition to adulthood is a window of opportunity  for changing the life course.

Author information: (1)University of Michigan, Center for Human Growth and Development, Ann Arbor,  MI 48109-0406, USA. lmgutman@umich.edu	The prevalence, recurrence, and incidence of depression in adolescence and young  adulthood are substantial for both males and females. In this study, we examined  social setting variables that influence depression in males and females from  adolescence to young adulthood. Rather than focusing on single ecological  factors, we examined multiple settings including families, peers, and  neighborhoods using longitudinal data from 372 families living in a large  eastern urban area. We found that variables related to depression differed for  males and females depending on the developmental period being examined. Family  and peer variables in adolescence were significantly related to change in  depression during the transition to adulthood for males, whereas family and  neighborhood variables were marginally significant for females. Family and  neighborhood variables in adulthood were significantly related to change in  depression for females, and peer variables were significant for both males and  females. Overall, contextual variables in adolescence had a more significant  impact on change in depression for males, whereas contemporary variables in  young adulthood had a more significant impact on change in depression for  females.

Author information: (1)The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205,  USA. hpetras@jhsph.edu	Theoretical models and empirical studies suggest that there are a number of  distinct pathways of aggressive behavior development in childhood that place  youth at risk for antisocial outcomes in adolescence and young adulthood. The  prediction of later antisocial behavior based on these early pathways, although  substantial, is not perfect. The goal of the present study was to identify  factors that explain why some boys on a high-risk developmental trajectory in  middle childhood do not experience an untoward outcome, and, conversely, why  some boys progressing on a low-risk trajectory do become involved in later  antisocial behavior. To that end, we explored a set of theoretically derived  predictors measured at entrance to elementary and middle school and examined  their utility in explaining discordant cases. First-grade reading achievement,  race, and poverty status proved to be significant early predictors of  discordance, whereas the significant middle-school predictors were parent  monitoring, deviant peer affiliation, and neighborhood level of deviant  behavior.

Antisocial behavior in the transition to adulthood: the independent and  interactive roles of developmental history and emerging developmental tasks.	Roisman GI(1), Aguilar B, Egeland B.	Author information: (1)University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA.	Although the turning points theory posits that the successful engagement of the  romantic and work domains in young adulthood represents an important opportunity  for disrupting antisocial pathways, others have recently speculated that such  turning points may be most applicable to the majority of antisocial youth who  begin offending in adolescence (Adolescence-Onset [AO]), rather than those who  begin early in childhood and persist (Early-Onset/Persistent [EOP]). This study  was designed (a) to attempt replication of recent evidence that AOs demonstrate  problem behaviors intermediate to EOP and Never Antisocial youth in young  adulthood, which was confirmed; and (b) to examine the correlates of lower  levels of antisocial offending among AOs and EOPs in the transition to  adulthood. As expected, AOs were more likely than EOPs to desist by age 23.  Nonetheless, positive work and romantic involvement between the ages of 21 and  23 were significantly associated with less externalizing problems for EOPs, but  not AOs. In addition, illicit substance use and deviant peer association proved  to be associated with externalizing problems at age 23, irrespective of the  patterning of young adults' antisocial behavior in childhood and adolescence.  Results suggest that the unique opportunities available in the transition to  adulthood may hold particular promise for youth with persistently troubled early  histories.

Author information: (1)University of South Florida, St. Petersburg, 140 Seventh Avenue South, Dav  249, St. Petersburg, FL 33701, USA.	In the decade since the first observationally based empirical studies of  coparenting process in nuclear families made their mark, most investigations of  early coparenting dynamics have examined whether and how such dynamics drive  child development trajectories, rather than identifying factors that may  contribute to the differential development of such dynamics in the first place.  In this prospective study, we examined both individual-representational and  dyadic-interpersonal predictors of early coparental process. Fifty married  couples expecting their first child portrayed their expectations and concerns  about family life after the baby's arrival, and took part in a set of  problem-solving tasks used to help evaluate marital quality. Both mothers' and  fathers' prebaby expectations about the future family, and prenatal marital  quality, predicted observed coparenting cohesion at 3 months postpartum.  Maternal- and marriage-coparenting trajectories differed as a function of infant  characteristics, with pathways most pronounced when infants were rated high in  negative reactivity. Results reveal how the prenatal environment can come to  shape early coparenting process, and indicate that family models must take into  account the role that child characteristics can play in altering  prebirth-postpartum pathways.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Marquette University, P.O. Box 1881, Milwaukee, WI  53201-1881, USA. John.Grych@marquette.edu	This study draws on the family systems concepts of triangulation and wholism to  investigate how interparental conflict may affect adolescents' psychological  adjustment. An ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample (N = 388) of 14-  to 18-year-olds completed measures of interparental conflict, family  relationships, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. We found that  triangulation into parental disagreements mediated the association between  parental conflict and both internalizing and externalizing problems. Adolescents  exposed to more frequent, intense, and poorly resolved conflict were more likely  to feel triangulated, but this association was moderated by the nature of the  alliances they had with their parents. Specifically, at low levels of  interparental conflict, adolescents who had substantially stronger alliances  with one parent than the other reported greater triangulation than those with  more balanced alliances. At high levels of conflict, these groups reported  similar degrees of triangulation. We also found that supportive parent-child  relationships reduced adolescents' appraisals of threat and self-blame for  interparental conflict, while more empathic relationships with siblings  increased these appraisals. Finally, close relationships with fathers acted as a  protective factor that reduced symptoms of maladjustment.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579404004717 PMID: 15605630 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Harvard Medical School, Division on Addictions, Boston, MA 02215, USA.  snelson@hms.harvard.edu	This report examines the predictive validity of sociometric status at age 9-10  to young adult (age 23-24) antisocial behavior, work and school engagement, and  arrests using Oregon Youth Study males (N = 206). A variety of analytic  strategies included (a) multivariate analyses to examine the variation in adult  adaptation as a function of sociometric classification at age 9-10, (b)  regression analyses to evaluate the relative contribution of "liked most" and  "liked least" peer nominations, and (c) structural equation modeling to predict  the young adult outcome constructs from social preference at age 9-10. Contrary  to expectation, when controlling for early antisocial behavior and academic  skills, boys' social preference scores still predicted young adult outcomes.  Longitudinal findings are discussed with respect to the salience of male peer  rejection in middle childhood and the social developmental processes that may  account for the predictive validity of peer rejection.

Oldehinkel AJ(1), Hartman CA, De Winter AF, Veenstra R, Ormel J.	Author information: (1)University of Groningen, Department of Psychiatry, The Netherlands.  a.j.oldehinkel@med.rug.nl	This study investigates how temperament factors are linked to internalizing and  externalizing problems in a Dutch population sample of preadolescents (N =  2230). Internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed by the Child  Behavior Checklist and the Youth Self-Report and temperament was evaluated by  the parent-version of the Revised Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire.  Temperament profiles were examined in children with (a) neither internalizing  nor externalizing problems, (b) only internalizing problems, (c) only  externalizing problems, and (d) both internalizing and externalizing problems.  The results suggest clearly diverging temperament profiles for these groups of  children, with High-Intensity Pleasure and Shyness (representing the broad  dimension of Surgency) steering the conditional probability of internalizing and  externalizing problems (direction markers), Frustration mainly being related to  maladaptation in general (severity marker), and Fear and Effortful Control being  associated with both the severity and the direction of internalizing and  externalizing problems, respectively. Girls and boys differed in the  distribution across the problem groups, but the associations between temperament  and psychopathology were comparable for both genders.

Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin at Madison, 53706-8190, USA.	To examine the effects of early emotional neglect on children's affective  development, we assessed children who had experienced institutionalized care  prior to adoption into family environments. One task required children to  identify photographs of facial expressions of emotion. A second task required  children to match facial expressions to an emotional situation. Internationally  adopted, postinstitutionalized children had difficulty identifying facial  expressions of emotion. In addition, postinstitutionalized children had  significant difficulty matching appropriate facial expressions to happy, sad,  and fearful scenarios. However, postinstitutionalized children performed as well  as comparison children when asked to identify and match angry facial  expressions. These results are discussed in terms of the importance of emotional  input early in life on later developmental organization.

Laura.Hanish@asu.edu	Using a short-term longitudinal design, internalizing and externalizing emotions  were examined as risk factors for being victimized by peers in early childhood.  Regulation, aggression, and withdrawal were also tested as mediators. We found  that anger, mediated by aggression and regulation, positively predicted being  victimized, although the way in which anger related to victimization risk varied  for boys and girls and across time. These findings were robust, particularly for  girls, attesting to the importance of externalizing variables as risk factors  for young children's victimization. Support for internalizing variables as risk  factors for being victimized was weak. The implications of the findings for  developmental models connecting symptomatology and victimization are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579404044542 PMID: 15487599 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Attachment in infancy and preschool in low socioeconomic status rural  Appalachian children: stability and change and relations to preschool and  kindergarten competence.	Fish M(1).	Author information: (1)Center for Rural Health, Marshall University School of Medicine, Huntington,  WV 25701-3655, USA. fishm@marshall.edu	Attachment classifications were obtained from the Strange Situation at 15 months  and at 4 years for a sample of 82 low socioeconomic status rural Appalachian  children. The rate of secure attachment in infancy was 50.5%, and the majority  of insecure infants were disorganized. At 4 years of age 61.2% of children were  secure; early secure relationships were likely to be maintained, and about half  of the insecure infants changed to a secure classification by 4 years. Overall,  there was low but significant stability in attachment at the level of  secure/insecure. Comparisons of (a) children who changed from insecure to secure  with those who were stable insecure and (b) stable secure children with those  who changed from secure to insecure identified contextual, child, and maternal  interaction factors associated with attaining secure attachment. Assessments of  cognitive and socioemotional competence at 4 years and kindergarten age  suggested a protective effect of secure infant attachment but little benefit  from secure preschool attachment.

Sheinkopf SJ(1), Mundy P, Claussen AH, Willoughby J.	Author information: (1)E P Bradley Hospital, Brown Medical School, East Providence, RI 02915, USA.  Stephen_Sheinkopf@brown.edu	This study examined whether infant joint attention (JA) skills predicted social  behaviors in a sample of at-risk preschool children (n = 30) with a history of  prenatal exposure to cocaine. JA behaviors were assessed with the Early Social  and Communication Scales at 12, 15, and 18 months of age. Three classes of JA  were measured: Initiating JA (IJA), Responding to JA (RJA), and Requests.  Behavioral outcomes were measured at 36 months and included ratings of  disruptive and withdrawn behaviors and social competence. JA behaviors were  related to behavioral outcomes after controlling for language and cognitive  ability. The functionally distinct uses of JA were differentially related to  behavioral outcome. IJA negatively predicted disruptive behaviors, whereas  Requests positively predicted disruptive behaviors. Infant RJA negatively  predicted withdrawn behaviors and positively predicted social competence. These  results are interpreted in the context of competing theories that attempt to  explain variability in the expression of JA skills in the second year of life.

The course of maternal depressive symptoms and maternal sensitivity as  predictors of attachment security at 36 months.	Campbell SB(1), Brownell CA, Hungerford A, Spieker SI, Mohan R, Blessing JS.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.  sbcamp@pitt.edu	We examined the course of maternal depressive symptoms and children's attachment  security at 36 months in a large sample of mother-child pairs from 10 sites  across the country participating in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care (N =  1077). Maternal depressive symptoms predicted higher rates of insecure  attachment. Women who reported intermittent symptoms across the first 36 months  had preschoolers who were more likely to be classified as insecure C or D; women  with chronic symptoms were more likely to have preschoolers who were classified  as insecure D. Symptoms reported only during the first 15 months were not  associated with elevated rates of later insecurity. After controlling for  potentially confounding demographic variables, maternal sensitivity (observed at  6, 15, 24, and 36 months) did not meaningfully account for links between  attachment security and patterns of depressive symptoms. However, the course and  timing of maternal depressive symptoms interacted with maternal sensitivity to  predict insecurity. Women with late, intermittent, or chronic symptoms who were  also low in sensitivity were more likely to have preschoolers who were insecure,  in contrast to symptomatic women who were high in sensitivity. These data have  implications for understanding the combined impact of maternal depressive  symptoms and maternal sensitivity on children's socioemotional development.

Early adolescent through young adult alcohol and marijuana use trajectories:  early predictors, young adult outcomes, and predictive utility.	Flory K(1), Lynam D, Milich R, Leukefeld C, Clayton R.	Author information: (1)University of Kentucky, USA. florykh@upmc.edu	The present study takes a developmental approach to subgrouping and examines the  trajectories of substance use from early adolescence through young adulthood  among a community sample of 481 individuals. The patterns of use were examined,  subgroups were identified separately for men and women and for alcohol and  marijuana, and psychosocial predictors and psychopathology outcomes that  differentiated the groups were identified. The results revealed three  substantially overlapping subgroups for both alcohol and marijuana: early onset,  late onset, and nonuser. Although the general patterns of which dependent  variables were related to group were similar for alcohol and marijuana, a closer  examination revealed important subgroup differences. For alcohol use, the  early-onset group was more dysfunctional in terms of predictors and outcomes  whereas the late-onset and nonuser groups were better adjusted. In contrast, for  marijuana, the early- and late-onset groups were both more dysfunctional than  the nonuser group. In a final analysis, we examined the predictive utility of  our developmental approach to subgrouping compared to a traditional, static  approach.

Joseph RM(1), Tager-Flusberg H.	Author information: (1)Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Boston University School of Medicine,  MA 02118, USA. rmjoseph@bu.edu	Although neurocognitive impairments in theory of mind and in executive functions  have both been hypothesized to play a causal role in autism, there has been  little research investigating the explanatory power of these impairments with  regard to autistic symptomatology. The present study examined the degree to  which individual differences in theory of mind and executive functions could  explain variations in the severity of autism symptoms. Participants included 31  verbal, school-aged children with autism who were administered a battery of  tests assessing the understanding of mental states (knowledge and false belief)  and executive control skills (working memory, combined working memory and  inhibitory control, and planning) and who were behaviorally evaluated for autism  severity in the three core symptom domains. Whereas theory of mind and executive  control abilities explained the significant variance beyond that accounted for  by language level in communication symptoms, neither explained the significant  variance in reciprocal social interaction or repetitive behaviors symptoms.  These findings are discussed in terms of a proposed distinction between higher  level, cognitive-linguistic aspects of theory of mind and related executive  control skills, and more fundamental social-perceptual processes involved in the  apprehension of mental state information conveyed through eyes, faces, and  voices, which may be more closely linked to autistic deficits in social  reciprocity.

Arsenio WF(1), Sesin M, Siegel L.	Author information: (1)Ferkhauf Graduate School of Psychology, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY 10461,  USA. warsenio@aecom.yu.edu	This study examined the abilities of 40 Latina mothers and their 6- to  11-year-old children (20 girls, 20 boys) to recognize and produce emotion  expressions and how these abilities differed as a function of maternal  depressive symptoms. The results indicated that depressively symptomatic mothers  were less accurate at recognizing basic emotions (e.g., happy, sad, etc.) and  some mixed emotions (e.g., scared/ok combinations) than nonsymptomatic mothers,  but there were no group differences for emotion production. In contrast,  children of symptomatic mothers posed fewer recognizable sad expressions than  their peers. Error pattern analyses also revealed that children of symptomatic  mothers were more likely to mistakenly recognize happiness and to avoid posing  sadness (across all basic emotions). Children's ability to pose emotions was  related to their mothers' emotion production, and this was not moderated by  maternal depressive symptoms. The discussion focuses on the possible  interpersonal consequences of these biases and deficits in the emotion-related  abilities of symptomatic mothers and their children and on the need to conduct  research on the familial and cultural processes that might underlie these  findings.

[No authors listed]	The purpose of this study was to examine child, maternal, and family antecedents  of children's early affect dysregulation within the mother-child relationship  and later cognitive and socioemotional correlates of affect dysregulation.  Children's affect dysregulation at 24 and 36 months was defined in the context  of mother-child interactions in semistructured play and toy cleanup. Dyads were  classified as dysregulated at each age based on high negative affect. Affect  dysregulation was associated with less maternal sensitivity and stimulation,  more maternal depressive symptoms, and lower family income over the first 36  months of life. Children with early negative mood, lower Bayley Mental  Development Index scores and insecure-avoidant (15 months) or insecure-resistant  attachment classifications (36 months) were more likely to be in an  affect-dysregulated group. Controlling for family and child variables,  affect-dysregulated children had more problematic cognitive, social, and  behavioral outcomes at 54 months, kindergarten, and first grade. The findings  are discussed in terms of the early role played by parents in assisting children  with affect regulation, the reciprocal nature of parent-child interactions, and  the contribution of affect regulation to children's later cognitive, social, and  behavioral competence.

Author information: (1)Psychology Department, Oregon State University, Corvallis 97331, USA.  dderryberry@orst.edu	This paper examines the advantages that arise from an individual differences  approach to children's coping and vulnerabilities. It suggests that the basic  motivational and attentional systems involved in temperament constitute  relatively primitive coping mechanisms. With development, these primitive coping  skills are aided by representational and other cortical functions, allowing the  coping process to begin before a stressful event and thereby increasing the  child's capacity to plan an effective coping option and to enhance self-control.  Such an emphasis on motivational and attentional differences allows us to take  advantage of children's diverse personalities as "experiments of nature" and to  better understand the temperamental patterns that contribute to adaptive and  maladaptive outcomes.

The effect of adverse intrauterine and newborn environments on cognitive  development: the experiences of premature delivery and diabetes during  pregnancy.	Sesma HW(1), Georgieff MK.	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, USA.	The prenatal and early postnatal periods constitute a time of rapid development  when the brain is in a state of both heightened plasticity and vulnerability.  Premature infants and infants of diabetic mothers represent two experiments of  nature that allow researchers to observe how the developing brain responds to  early biological challenge of either a global or regionally specific nature. We  outline a set of organizing principles for conceptualizing the mechanisms by  which early adverse experience may be encoded in the brain and subsequently  expressed in behavior. We then review the available literature on developmental  outcomes for infants born premature and infants of diabetic mothers. Research  examining the relative influence of experience and maturation in the development  of preterm infants indicates that advance experience does not accelerate the  advent of specific cognitive capacities, but may enhance performance once the  particular ability has emerged. Long-term follow-up of preterm infants also  reveals evidence for plasticity and cognitive improvement into early adolescence  for later maturing executive functions. Finally we offer an integrated model for  investigating cognitive outcomes in infants of diabetic mothers that  incorporates data from animal, electrophysiological, and behavioral measures.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, Tulane University Health Sciences Center, New  Orleans, LA 70112, USA. czeanah@tulane.edu	This paper provides an overview of the largest longitudinal investigation of  institutionalized children less than 2 years old ever conducted. The Bucharest  Early Intervention Project is an ongoing randomized controlled trial of foster  placement as an alternative to institutionalization in abandoned infants and  toddlers being conducted in Bucharest, Romania. In addition to describing the  contexts in which this study is imbedded, we also provide an overview of the  sample, the measures, and the intervention. We hope that the natural experiment  of institutionalization will allow us to examine directly the effects of  intervention on early deprivation. We hope it will provide answers to many of  the critical questions that developmentalists have asked about the effects of  early experience, the timing of deprivation, and the ameliorating effects of  early intervention and provide clues to which underlying neurobiological  processes are compromised by, and resilient to, dramatic changes in early  experience.

Tom_OConnor@URMC.Rochester.edu	Questions concerning the long-term effects of early experience on psychological  development in humans continue to stir up controversy. There are, at present,  great diversity and contradictions among extant conceptual models and inadequate  data to resolve these differences. Limited opportunities to use experimental  approaches and the inherent restrictions of observational approaches in research  on humans implies that alternative research designs are needed.

Conceptual, methodological, and statistical challenges in brain imaging studies  of developmentally based psychopathologies.	Peterson BS(1).	Author information: (1)Columbia College of Physicians & Surgeons and New York State Psychiatric  Institute, New York, NY 10032, USA. PetersoB@child.cpmc.columbia.edu	Brain imaging studies in developmentally based psychopathologies most often use  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study regional volumes, task-related  activity, neurometabolite concentrations, or the paths of fiber tracts within  the brain. Methodological challenges for the use of MRI in studying these  disorders include understanding the ultrastructural correlates of brain  structure and function that are below the limits of resolution of this imaging  modality and developing better methods for approximating the anatomical  boundaries of the cytoarchitectonic units that are defined by those  ultrastructural characteristics. Conceptual challenges include distinguishing  findings that represent pathophysiologically central causes from compensatory  and epiphenomenal effects, a difficulty that stems directly from the inherently  correlational nature of imaging data. The promise of functional imaging studies  must capitalize on the specificity of the cognitive and behavioral probes that  are used to illuminate core features of the pathophysiology of developmental  disorders, while recognizing the assumptions and limitations of the subtraction  paradigms that are used to isolate the brain functions of interest. Statistical  challenges include incorporating adequate statistical models for scaling effects  within the brain, as well as modeling important demographic correlates that  contribute to the substantial interindividual variability inherent in most  imaging data. Statistical analyses need to consider the substantial  intercorrelation of measures across the brain and the importance of correcting  for multiple statistical comparisons, as well as the need for improved methods  for brain warping and for assessing effective connectivity in functional imaging  studies.

Moving research on resilience into the 21st century: theoretical and  methodological considerations in examining the biological contributors to  resilience.	Curtis WJ(1), Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, NY 14608, USA.  wjcurtis@psych.rochester.edu	Empirical investigations of resilience over the past 30 years have examined a  wide range of psychosocial correlates of, and contributors to, this phenomenon.  Thus far, theoretical treatments of resilience have focused almost exclusively  on psychosocial levels of analysis to derive explanatory models. However, there  have been no formal discussions of either theory or research that have examined  the biological contributors to, or correlates of, competent functioning despite  the experience of adversity. This paper seeks to fill this gap and sets forth a  preliminary theoretical framework and outline of empirical strategies for  studying the biological underpinnings of resilience. The initial sections of the  paper discuss the particular suitability of a transactional organizational  theoretical perspective as a conceptual foundation for including a biological  level of analysis within the extant theoretical framework of resilience.  Subsequently, other important theoretical considerations for the inclusion of a  biological perspective on resilience are discussed, including the avoidance of  an approach that would reduce resilience to merely a biological process, the  application of the constructs of multifinality and equifinality to a biological  perspective on resilience, as well as a general discussion of the potential for  utilization of brain imaging and other technologies in the study of resilience.  The possible relation between the mechanisms of neural plasticity and resilience  are examined in some detail, with specific suggestions concerning research  questions needed to examine this association. Sections of the paper discuss the  likely relation of several areas of brain and biological functioning with  resilience, including emotion, cognition, neuroendocrine and immune functioning,  and genetics. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of a  biological perspective on resilience for preventive interventions.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579403000373 PMID: 14582940 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

As the US population becomes more diverse in the 21st century, researchers face  many conceptual and methodological challenges in working with diverse  populations. We discuss these issues for racially and ethnically diverse youth,  using Spencer's phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory (PVEST) as  a guiding framework. We present a brief historical background and discuss  recurring conceptual flaws in research on diverse youth, presenting PVEST as a  corrective to these flaws. We highlight the interaction of race, culture,  socioeconomic status, and various contexts of development with identity  formation and other salient developmental processes. Challenges in research  design and interpretation of data are also covered with regard to both  assessment of contexts and developmental processes. We draw upon examples from  neighborhood assessments, ethnic identity development, and attachment research  to illustrate conceptual and methodological challenges, and we discuss  strategies to address these challenges. The policy implications of our analysis  are also considered.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579403000361 PMID: 14582939 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Biostatistics Group, School of Epidemiology and Health Science, University of  Manchester, UK. andrew.pickles@man.ac.uk	The question of whether to view psychopathology as categorical or dimensional  continues to provoke debate. We review the many facets of this argument. These  include the pragmatics of measurement; the needs of clinical practice; our  ability to distinguish categories from dimensions empirically; methods of  analysis appropriate to each and how they relate; and the potential theoretical  biases associated with each approach. We conclude that much of the debate is  misconceived in that we do not observe pathology directly; rather, we observe  its properties. The same pathology can have some properties that are most easily  understood using a dimensional conceptualization while at the same time having  other properties that are best understood categorically. We suggest replacing  Meehl's analogy involving qualitatively distinct species with an alternative  analogy with the "duality" of light, a phenomenon with both wave- and  particle-like properties.

Marsh P(1), McFarland FC, Allen JP, McElhaney KB, Land D.	Author information: (1)University of Virginia, Charlottesville 22904-4400, USA.	A diathesis-stress interaction model is used to describe multifinality in  adolescent internalizing and risky behavioral outcomes. Problematic behavior  associated with adolescent insecure preoccupation (a diathesis) was expected to  interact with the level of maternal autonomous discourse (a stressor) to predict  specific adolescent outcomes. Assessments of adolescent preoccupied attachment  organization, observations of maternal displays of autonomy in mother-adolescent  interactions, and adolescent reports of internalizing symptoms and risky  behaviors were obtained at age 16. As predicted, maternal autonomy in the  mother-adolescent relationship helped to explain multifinality in dysfunctional  symptoms among preoccupied adolescents. Adolescent preoccupation was more  strongly linked to internalizing behavior when mothers demonstrated low levels  of autonomy in interactions with their adolescents and more strongly linked to  risky behavior when mothers displayed extremely high levels of autonomy.  Implications for autonomy processes in increasing our understanding of how  adolescent insecure-preoccupation relates to profiles of specific problems  during adolescence are discussed as is the importance of exploring the role of  attachment in different contexts.

Nagin DS(1), Pagani L, Tremblay RE, Vitaro F.	Author information: (1)Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. dn03@andrew.cmu.edu	Our objective is to advance the life course analytical framework by  demonstrating a model for testing two of its tenets. The first is whether the  individual's developmental history conditions the response to a turning point  event. The second is whether the influence of a major life event upon an  individual's developmental course depends upon the timing of the event. We test  both propositions in an analysis of the effect of grade retention on a child's  trajectory of physical aggression. Our analysis is based on data from a  longitudinal study of 1,037 boysfrom schools in the lowest socioeconomic areas  in Montreal, Canada. We find clear evidence that a developmental history of  physical aggression conditions the child's response to grade retention. The  evidence on whether the timing of retention affects this response is less clear.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579403000191 PMID: 12931832 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Wilson BJ(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Graduate Psychology, Seattle Pacific University, WA 98119-1997,  USA. bjwilson@spu.edu	This study evaluated the role of attentional shifting in children's prosocial  behavior with peers. Participants were 27 aggressive/rejected and 27  nonaggressive/popular kindergarten and first grade boys and girls. Children's  ability to shift attention from one affective state to another was assessed  during: (a) a computerized task that required shifting attention between  different affective events (i.e., the Children's Attentional Shifting Task,  CAST) and (b) an analogue entry task with unacquainted peers. Children's latency  for sharing with peers was assessed after they experienced failure during the  entry task. Aggressive/rejected children had significant difficulty shifting  attention from negative to positive affect during the CAST and were slower to  share after experiencing entry failure. In general, aggressive/rejected children  were less able to regulate their behavior effectively after experiencing social  failure. Girls, regardless of status, had less difficulty than boys shifting  attention from one affective state to another during the CAST. In addition,  children's social status/aggressiveness, their ability to regulate emotional  behavior after social failure and to shift attention effectively on the CAST  predicted approximately 31% of the variance in their latency to share. These  findings suggest that the ability to shift attention between different affective  states plays a significant role in children's prosocial behavior with peers.

Mother-child interaction in autistic and nonautistic children: characteristics  of maternal approach behaviors and child social responses.	Doussard-Roosevelt JA(1), Joe CM, Bazhenova OV, Porges SW.	Author information: (1)Department of Human Development, University of Maryland, College Park  20742-1131, USA.	The nature of mother-child interaction in autism and the maternal approach  characteristics that elicit social response in children with autism were  examined in two studies. Mother-child play sessions of 24 preschool children  with autism and 24 typically developing preschoolers were compared in Study 1,  and play sessions of 9 mothers with their autistic child and with their  nonautistic child were compared in Study 2. Mother-child interactions were coded  using the Approach Withdrawal Interaction Coding System to quantify maternal  approach behaviors and child responses. Results of Study 1 indicate that,  although the quantity of approaches did not differ between mothers with their  autistic children and mothers with their nonautistic children, there were  qualitative differences. Mothers used more physical contact, more high-intensity  behaviors, and fewer social verbal approaches with autistic children. Results of  Study 2 replicated these findings with mothers showing a similar pattern of  approach toward their autistic children but not their nonautistic children.  Although autistic children displayed lower contingency to maternal approaches in  general, they showed greater responsiveness to approaches involving increased  physical proximity and/or containing nonverbal object use.

Exposure to partner violence and child behavior problems: a prospective study  controlling for child physical abuse and neglect, child cognitive ability,  socioeconomic status, and life stress.	Yates TM(1), Dodds MF, Sroufe LA, Egeland B.	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.	Previous research suggests an association between partner violence and child  behavior problems. However, methodological shortcomings have precluded the  formation of directional conclusions. These limitations include failure to  control for the effects of child physical abuse and general life stress,  employment of nonrepresentative samples from battered women's shelters, and  reliance on a single contemporaneous reporter, usually the mother, for  information on both independent and dependent measures. This study used  prospective, longitudinal data (N = 155) and multiple informants to examine the  relation between maternal reports of partner violence in the homeand teacher-  and youth-report ratings of concurrent and prospective child behavior problems.  Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to control for the effects  of child physical abuse, child physical neglect, socioeconomic status, child  cognitive ability, and life stress. The contribution of partner violence to  child behavior problems was confirmed for boys' (n = 81) externalizing problems  and girls' (n = 74) internalizing problems. Child developmental status at the  time of exposure further influenced these relations. For boys, behavior problems  in middle childhood were most strongly related to contemporaneous partner  violence, whereas behavior problems among both boys and girls at age 16 were  most strongly related to partner violence exposure during the preschool years.

The contribution of parents and siblings to antisocial and depressive behavior  in adolescents: a double jeopardy coercion model.	Compton K(1), Snyder J, Schrepferman L, Bank L, Shortt JW.	Author information: (1)Wichita State University, KS 67260-0034, USA.	A dual coercion model of family processes associated with the development of  antisocial and depressive behavior during adolescence was assessed, using an  at-risk sample of families and children. Consistent with the model, involvement  in family coercion during childhood and adolescence increased both boys' and  girls' risk for antisocial behavior in adolescence and girls' risk for  depressive behavior. Coercive family processes served as a link between older  and younger siblings' antisocial behavior. Childhood exposure to maternal  depression predicted boys' and girls' depressive behavior 10 years later, but  this association was not mediated by coercion. The data suggest that family risk  factors and processes for antisocial development are similar for boys and girls  but pathways to depression may be gender specific.

A sense of containment: potential moderator of the relation between parenting  practices and children's externalizing behaviors.	Schneider WJ(1), Cavell TA, Hughes JN.	Author information: (1)Texas A&M University, USA.	We introduce the construct of perceived containment, defined as children's  beliefs about adults' capacity to impose firm limits and to prevail if there is  a conflict in goals. We propose that children's containment beliefs represent an  important but understudied factor in the development and maintenance of  childhood aggression. Children's ratings on the Perceived Containment  Questionnaire (PCQ) were inversely related to parent and teacher ratings of  externalizing problems. Moreover, this relation was found to be independent of  the quality of parental discipline. We also found evidence that perceived  containment moderated the relation between overly harsh, inept discipline and  children's externalizing behaviors: ineffective discipline was directly related  to externalizing problems in children with relatively high PCQ scores but was  unrelated to externalizing problems in children with relatively low PCQ scores.  For the latter group of children, the affective quality of the mother-child  relationship was a better predictor of problem behavior. These findings provide  additional support for Kochanska's (1993) model of differential socialization  and for Frick's (1998) assertions concerning meaningful subgroups of aggressive  children.

Emotion regulation behavior during a separation procedure in 18-month-old  children of mothers using cocaine and other drugs.	Molitor A(1), Mayes LC, Ward A.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of San Diego, CA 92110-2492, USA.  amolitor@sandiego.edu	This study examined the association between maternal cocaine use and children's  emotional regulation. Using a brief separation procedure, we observed 78  18-month-old at-risk children and their mothers from three defined maternal  groups: no drug use; no cocaine use but a positive history for alcohol, tobacco,  and/or marijuana; and cocaine use with or without alcohol, tobacco, and/or  marijuana. Coded videotaped behavior identified three maternal constructs  (separation style, physical engagement, and emotional engagement) and three  child constructs (negative reactivity to separation, initial regulatory  activity, and follow-up positive emotional engagement). Cocaine-using mothers  displayed less emotional engagement than other mothers. Children with  cocaine-using mothers displayed less negative reactivity and follow-up positive  emotional engagement than their counterparts. Child reactivity was connected to  maternal drug use, whereas emotional engagement during reunion was linked to  birthweight and maternal behavior. Results suggest a possible impairment or  restriction of emotional expression and regulation in the face of stress and/or  maternal disengagement that is more common among cocaine-exposed children with  their mothers.

Lochman JE(1), Wells KC.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa 35487, USA.  jlochman@gp.as.ua.edu	This study tests the contextual social-cognitive model, which has served as the  basis for the Coping Power program, an indicated preventive intervention with  at-risk preadolescent boys at the time of transition from elementary to middle  school. The contextual social-cognitive model assumes that aggressive children  have distortions in their social-cognitive appraisals and deficiencies in their  social problem solving skills and that their parents have deficiencies in their  parenting behaviors. To test this model, boys were identified as being at risk  on the basis of fourth grade and fifth grade teachers' ratings of children's  aggressive and disruptive behaviors, and interventions were delivered at the end  of elementary school and the beginning of middle school. The intervention effect  on delinquency, substance use, and school behavior outcomes was at least  partially mediated through intervention-produced changes in child and parent  variables that were targets for the intervention. These analyses provided unique  support for the assumptions in the contextual social-cognitive model that  changes in these mediating processes, even among high-risk boys, can have a  meaningful impact on later negative outcomes.

Lacourse E(1), Côté S, Nagin DS, Vitaro F, Brendgen M, Tremblay RE.	Author information: (1)Carnegie-Mellon University.	A longitudinal study with a nested preventive intervention was used to test five  hypotheses generated from developmental theories of antisocial behavior. The  longitudinal study followed 909 boys from their kindergarten year up to 17 years  of age. The randomized multimodal preventive intervention targeted a subsample  of boys who were rated disruptive by their kindergarten teacher. Semiparametric  analyses of developmental trajectories for self-reported physical aggression,  vandalism, and theft identified more types of trajectories than expected from  recent theoretical models. Also, these trajectories did not confirm theoretical  models, which suggest a general increase of antisocial behavior during  adolescence. The majority of boys were on either a low-level antisocial behavior  trajectory or a declining trajectory. Less than 6% appeared to follow a  trajectory of chronic antisocial behavior. Comparisons between disruptive and  nondisruptive kindergarten boys confirmed the hypothesis that disruptive  preschool children are at higher risk of following trajectories of frequent  antisocial behavior. Comparisons between treated and untreated disruptive boys  confirmed that an intensive preventive intervention between 7 and 9 years of  age, which included parent training and social skills training, could change the  long-term developmental trajectories of physical aggression, vandalism, and  theft for disruptive kindergarten boys in low socioeconomic areas. The results  suggest that trajectories of violent behavior can be deflected by interventions  that do not specifically target the physiological deficits that are often  hypothesized to be a causal factor. The value of longitudinal-experimental  studies from early childhood onward is discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579402004121 PMID: 12549709 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The other side of the coin: using intervention research in child anxiety  disorders to inform developmental psychopathology.	Hudson JL(1), Kendall PC, Coles ME, Robin JA, Webb A.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia.  jhudson@psy.mq.edu.au	With advancements in the technology of prevention and treatment of childhood  anxiety disorders, information regarding our understanding of normal and  abnormal child development can be enriched. Typically, research has focused on  developing efficacious and effective interventions with less attention devoted  to the impact this information may have on the field of developmental  psychopathology. By reviewing the results of both treatment and prevention  studies, several potential contributions of intervention research to the field  can be explored. Results from wait-list or monitoring control groups will be  reviewed, providing valuable information regarding the normal trajectory of the  anxious child. Outcomes of children receiving the intervention prove that this  pathway can be altered and is not impermeable. Furthermore, a review of  long-term follow-up studies addresses the question of whether intervention can  change the long-term trajectory of an anxiety-disordered child and prevent  disorders in later life. Contributions to the etiological understanding of the  anxiety disorders will also be reviewed: changes in variables considered  important in the etiology and maintenance of disorder can be examined in  synchronicity with changes in symptomatology following intervention. An  examination of potential developmental predictors of treatment outcome will also  contribute to this review, with a focus on the limitations of the current  research in gaining a complete understanding of the relationship between  developmental level and outcome. Directions regarding future research in the  study of interventions for child and adolescent anxiety disorders will be  discussed with the aim of promoting further communication between intervention  research and the field of developmental psychopathology.

Author information: (1)George Washington University, USA. cfrgwh@gwumc.edu	This paper addresses the issue of whether prevention research methods,  particularly those involving randomized prevention trials, can be used to test  theories concerning the etiology of psychopathology. Based on recent empirical  and theoretical work in developmental psychopathology, three aspects of  etiologic theory are discussed: risk and protective mechanisms, the integration  of environmental and genetic factors, and patterns of developmental progression  in psychopathology across the life span. It is suggested that integration of  prevention trial methods with methods from passive correlational designs,  behavioral genetics, and longitudinal studies allows for unique opportunities to  test hypotheses about etiology. Empirical literature on the development and  prevention of internalizing disorders, particularly depression, is presented to  support this argument. Limitations of prevention trials for testing theory are  also reviewed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579402004029 PMID: 12549699 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles 90095, USA.  cannon@psych.ucla.edu	Etiological research spanning domains of inquiry as diverse as social psychology  and molecular genetics has identified a number of potential factors that likely  contribute to the development and clinical manifestation of schizophrenia. In  this article, we first highlight the challenges inherent in developing cogent  etiological models that represent both the diversity of suspected causal  influences and their mechanisms of action. Then, using our own research program  as a heuristic context, we present a general analytical framework for  identifying and integrating multiple types of etiologic factors across different  levels of analysis in the prediction of schizophrenia. In recognition of the  myriad complexities of multifactorial causation, we argue that a multilevel  causal perspective is required for the development and advancement of a fully  nuanced theory of schizophrenia etiology and pathophysiology.

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455,  USA. canelson@tc.umn.edu	The study of brain development and that of behavioral development have  historically proceeded independently of one another. This is an unfortunate set  of circumstances, given that the disciplines concerned with development-for  example, developmental psychology, pediatrics, psychiatry, clinical psychology,  and the neurosciences-have much to learn from each other. Drawing on recent  advances in the developmental brain and behavioral sciences, we illustrate the  transdisciplinary approach our group has adopted in the service of uniting the  research on brain and behavior in the context of development. We specifically  report on our nonhuman primate and human studies that collectively illustrate  our "genes to behavior" approach to the study of development. Our goal in  summarizing our research in this fashion is to promote discussion about  promising templates for how research on brain, behavior, and development might  proceed into the 21st century.

Jacobson KC(1), Prescott CA, Kendler KS.	Author information: (1)Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, USA.  jacobson@physio.vipbg.vcu.edu	The present study uses a population-based sample of 6.806 adult twins from  same-sex and opposite-sex twin pairs to examine sex differences in the  underlying genetic and environmental architecture of the development of  antisocial behavior (AB). Retrospective reports of AB during three different  developmental periods were obtained: prior to age 15 years (childhood), age  15-17 years (adolescent), and age 18 years and older (adult). Structural  equation modeling analyses revealed that there was no evidence for sex-specific  genetic or sex-specific shared family environmental influences on the  development of AB; that is, the types of genetic and environmental influence  were similar for males and females. For both sexes, a model that allowed for  genetic influences on adolescent and adult AB that were not shared with  childhood AB fit better than a model with a single genetic factor. In contrast,  shared environmental influences on adolescent and adult AB overlapped entirely  with shared environmental influences on childhood AB. Genetic factors played a  larger role in variation in childhood AB among females, whereas shared  environmental factors played a larger role among males. However, heritability of  AB increased from childhood to adolescence and adulthood for both sexes, and the  magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on adolescent and adult AB was  approximately equal across sex. We speculate that sex differences in timing of  puberty may account for the earlier presence of genetic effects among females.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579402002110 PMID: 12030698 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Wakschlag LS(1), Hans SL.	Author information: (1)University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA. laurie@yoda.bsd.uchicago.edu	Smoking during pregnancy is associated with adverse consequences for children.  Most recently, it has been established as a risk factor for developmental  psychopathology, specifically Conduct Disorder (CD). Although this association  has been shown to be robust, developmental pathways from exposure to CD have not  been established. We examined how prenatal exposure to cigarettes interacts with  child and family factors to increase risk of CD symptoms in a longitudinal study  of 10-year-old urban, African-American youth (N = 77). The effects of prenatal  exposure at school age were moderated by child sex. Boys whose mothers smoked  during pregnancy were significantly more likely to develop CD symptoms, but  exposure did not increase risk in girls. A similar trend was found during  infancy: prenatal smoking was associated with low sociability/negative  emotionality only for boys. The effects of smoking during pregnancy were also  moderated by the quality of the early caregiving environment. Exposed boys whose  mothers were unresponsive during infancy were at increased risk of CD symptoms,  but exposed boys with early responsive mothers were not. Prospective studies,  with developmentally based measures of behavior across time, are critical for  further elucidating pathways from prenatal exposure to cigarettes to the  development of clinical disorder. The identification of a potentially  modifiable, prenatal risk factor for early onset developmental psychopathology  has important implications for prevention.

Belsky J(1), Fearon RM.	Author information: (1)Institute for the Study of Children, Families and Social Issues, Birkbeck  University of London, UK. j.belsky@bbk.ac.uk	In light of evidence that the effects of attachment security on subsequent  development may be contingent on the social context in which the child continues  to develop, we examined the effect of attachment security at age 15 months,  cumulative contextual risk from 1 to 36 months, and the interaction of  attachment and cumulative risk to predict socioemotional and cognitive  linguistic functioning at age 3 years, using data from the National Institute of  Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care. Results indicated  that early attachment predicts both socioemotional development and language  skills, but not cognitive functioning as indexed by a measure of school  readiness, and that the effect of attachment on socioemotional development and  expressive language varied as a function of social-contextual risk.  Insecure-avoidant infants proved most vulnerable to contextual risk, not  children classified as secure or insecure more generally, although in one  instance security did prove protective with respect to the adverse effects of  cumulative contextual risk. Findings are discussed in terms of risk and  resilience and in light of the probabilistic nature of the relation between  early attachment and later development.

Author information: (1)Department of Family and Human Development, Arizona State University, Tempe  85287-2502, USA. Laura.Hanish@asu.edu	This study examined the effects of being victimized by peers on children's  behavioral, social, emotional, and academic functioning. We assessed an  ethnically diverse sample of 2,064 first, second, and fourth graders and  followed them over 2 years, locating 1,469 of the participants at the follow-up.  Correlation and partial correlation analyses revealed that prior victimization  predicted externalizing, internalizing, and social problems 2 years later for  the sample as a whole. However, not all victimized children experienced the same  types of outcomes; instead, there was heterogeneity in children's responses to  victimization. Using cluster analysis, we identified eight outcome patterns that  represented different patterns of functioning. These were labeled as  externalizing, internalizing, symptomatic, popular, disliked, absent, low  achieving, and high achieving. Discriminant function analyses revealed that the  symptomatic, externalizing, and disliked patterns were systematically related to  victimization. Moreover, significant gender and age differences in the severity  of effects were obtained. The discussion highlights the complexity of  victimization effects.

Raine A(1), Yaralian PS, Reynolds C, Venables PH, Mednick SA.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, 90089-1061, USA.  raine@usc.edu	Previous studies have repeatedly shown verbal intelligence deficits in  adolescent antisocial individuals, but it is not known whether these deficits  are in place prior to kindergarten or, alternatively, whether they are acquired  throughout childhood. This study assesses whether cognitive deficits occur as  early as age 3 years and whether they are specific to persistently antisocial  individuals. Verbal and spatial abilities were assessed at ages 3 and 11 years  in 330 male and female children, while antisocial behavior was assessed at ages  8 and 17 years. Persistently antisocial individuals (N = 47) had spatial  deficits in the absence of verbal deficits at age 3 years compared to  comparisons (N = 133), and also spatial and verbal deficits at age 11 years. Age  3 spatial deficits were independent of social adversity, early hyperactivity,  poor test motivation, poor test comprehension, and social discomfort during  testing, and they were found in females as well as males. Findings suggest that  early spatial deficits contribute to persistent antisocial behavior whereas  verbal deficits are developmentally acquired. An early-starter model is proposed  whereby early spatial impairments interfere with early bonding and attachment,  reflect disrupted right hemisphere affect regulation and expression, and  predispose to later persistent antisocial behavior.

Moffitt TE(1), Caspi A, Harrington H, Milne BJ.	Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA. t.moffitt@iop.kcl.ac.uk	This article reports a comparison on outcomes of 26-year-old males who were  defined several years ago in the Dunedin longitudinal study as exhibiting  childhood-onset versus adolescent-onset antisocial behavior and who were  indistinguishable on delinquent offending in adolescence. Previous studies of  these groups in childhood and adolescence showed that childhood-onset  delinquents had inadequate parenting, neurocognitive problems, undercontrolled  temperament, severe hyperactivity, psychopathic personality traits, and violent  behavior. Adolescent-onset delinquents were not distinguished by these features.  Here followed to age 26 years, the childhood-onset delinquents were the most  elevated on psychopathic personality traits, mental-health problems, substance  dependence, numbers of children, financial problems, work problems, and  drug-related and violent crime, including violence against women and children.  The adolescent-onset delinquents at 26 years were less extreme but elevated on  impulsive personality traits, mental-health problems, substance dependence,  financial problems, and property offenses. A third group of men who had been  aggressive as children but not very delinquent as adolescents emerged as  low-level chronic offenders who were anxious, depressed, socially isolated, and  had financial and work problems. These findings support the theory of  life-course-persistent and adolescence-limited antisocial behavior but also  extend it. Findings recommend intervention with all aggressive children and with  all delinquent adolescents, to prevent a variety of maladjustments in adult  life.

Allen JP(1), Hauser ST, O'Connor TG, Bell KL.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville 22904-4400,  USA. allen@virginia.edu	Observed parent-adolescent autonomy struggles were assessed as potential  predictors of the development of peer-rated hostility over a decade later in  young adulthood in both normal and previously psychiatrically hospitalized  groups of adolescents. Longitudinal, multireporter data were obtained by coding  family interactions involving 83 adolescents and their parents at age 16 years  and then obtaining ratings by close friends of adolescents' hostility at age 25  years. Fathers' behavior undermining adolescents' autonomy in interactions at  age 16 years were predictive of adolescents-as-young-adults' hostility, as rated  by close friends at age 25 years. These predictions contributed additional  variance to understanding young adult hostility even after accounting for  concurrent levels of adolescent hostility at age 16 years and paternal hostility  at this age, each of which also significantly contributed to predicting future  hostility. Results are discussed as highlighting a pathway by which difficulties  attaining autonomy in adolescence may presage the development of long-term  difficulties in social functioning.

Author information: (1)New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York 10032, USA.	Child abuse and neglect have repeatedly been shown to be risks for psychiatric  and personality disorders. However, much of this evidence is based on  retrospective reports of adults. In addition, little is known about the  developmental course of psychopathology among those exposed to child  maltreatment. In this study, we report mental disorders assessed from early  childhood to adulthood in those later identified as victims of abuse or neglect  by official or self-report. Findings show elevated rates of mental disorders and  symptoms in each of four groups relative to the normative sample. Groups  included those who had been victims of physical abuse or neglect according to  official report and those who had been victims of physical or sexual abuse by  self-report. As expected, the maltreated groups were quite different  demographically from the community comparison sample, especially those with  official reports. The group with retrospective self-reports of physical abuse  differed only modestly from the comparison group on the symptom and disorder  measures, while the sexually abused group showed the most consistently elevated  patterns, even after controls for demographic differences were taken into  account. The disorder and symptom patterns differed both by group and by age:  neglect cases showed a partial remission in adulthood, while official physical  abuse cases showed an increasingly consolidated pattern of antisocial and  impulsive behavior.

Keiley MK(1), Howe TR, Dodge KA, Bates JE, Petti GS.	Author information: (1)Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA. Keileym@cfs.Purdue.edu	In a sample of 578 children assessed in kindergarten through the eighth grade,  we used growth modeling to determine the basic developmental trajectories of  mother-reported and teacher-reported externalizing and internalizing behaviors  for three physical maltreatment groups of children-early-harmed (prior to age 5  years), later-harmed (age 5 years and over), and nonharmed--controlling for SES  and gender. Results demonstrated that the earlier children experienced harsh  physical treatment by significant adults, the more likely they were to  experience adjustment problems in early adolescence. Over multiple domains,  early physical maltreatment was related to more negative sequelae than the same  type of maltreatment occurring at later periods. In addition, the fitted growth  models revealed that the early-harmed group exhibited someswhat higher initial  levels of teacher-reported externalizing problems in kindergarten and  significantly different rates of change in these problem behaviors than other  children, as reported by mothers over the 9 years of this study. The  early-harmed children were also seen by teachers, in kindergarten, as exhibiting  higher levels of internalizing behaviors. The later-harmed children were seen by  their teachers as increasing their externalizing problem behaviors more rapidly  over the 9 years than did the early- or nonharmed children. These findings  indicate that the timing of maltreatment is a salient factor in examining the  developmental effects of physical harm.	PMCID: PMC2769082 PMID: 11771913 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Mt Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, NY 14608, USA.	Cortisol regulation was investigated in a sample of school-aged maltreated (n =  167) and demographically comparable low-income nonmaltreated (n = 204) boys and  girls in the context of a day camp research program. The presence of  clinical-level internalizing and clinical-level externalizing symptomatology was  determined through adult report and child self report. Children who exhibited  clinical-level internalizing problems only, clinical-level externalizing  problems only, and comorbid clinical-level internalizing and extemalizing  problems were identified. Clinical-level cases were more prevalent among the  maltreated children. Maltreated children with clinical-level internalizing  problems were distinguished by higher morning, afternoon, and average daily  cortisol levels across the week of camp attendance. In contrast, nonmaltreated  boys with clinical-level externalizing problems emerged as distinct in terms of  low levels of morning and average daily levels of cortisol. Maltreated children  with comorbid clinical-level internalizing and externalizing problems were more  likely not to show the expected diumal decrease in cortisol. The findings are  discussed in terms of the joint impact of maltreatment and different forms of  psychopathology on neuroendocrine regulation.	PMID: 11771908 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Childhood trauma and risk for PTSD: relationship to intergenerational effects of  trauma, parental PTSD, and cortisol excretion.	Yehuda R(1), Halligan SL, Grossman R.	Author information: (1)Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA.  Rachel.yehuda@med.va.gov	Among the adverse mental health consequences of childhood trauma is the risk  related to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adulthood.  Other risk factors for PTSD. including parental trauma exposure and parental  PTSD, can also contribute to the experience of child trauma. We examined  associations between childhood trauma and PTSD in 51 adult children of Holocaust  survivors and 41 comparison subjects. in consideration of parental trauma  exposure and parental PTSD. We also examined these variables in relation to  24-hr urinary cortisol levels. Adult offspring of Holocaust survivors showed  significantly higher levels of self-reported childhood trauma, particularly  emotional abuse and neglect. relative to comparison subjects. The difference was  largely attributable to parental PTSD. Self-reported childhood trauma was also  related to severity of PTSD in subjects, and emotional abuse was significantly  associated with 24-hr mean urinary cortisol secretion. We conclude that the  experience of childhood trauma may be an important factor in the transmission of  PTSD from parent to child.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579401003170 PMID: 11523857 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.	Adolescence is associated with an increase in the rate of certain psychiatric  symptoms, and it is typically the developmental period when prodromal features  of the major psychiatric disorders emerge. This is especially true of  schizophrenia, with the majority of patients showing a marked postpubertal rise  in schizotypal signs that predates the onset of clinical symptoms in early  adulthood. Cross-sectional studies of youth have revealed a positive correlation  between age and saliva cortisol level, suggesting a normative maturational  increase in activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. It has  been hypothesized that this increase may trigger the expression of symptoms in  vulnerable individuals. The present longitudinal study measured cortisol  secretion and its relation with symptom development in samples of youth with  schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), other personality disorders, or no Axis  II disorder. The findings indicate moderate stability in cortisol levels across  a 2-year period, with a longitudinal increase in cortisol levels over time.  Cortisol levels at the first and second assessments were correlated with the  severity of SPD symptoms at follow-up. The results are consistent with the  notion that the HPA axis undergoes a postpubertal maturational process that  moderates the expression of psychiatric symptoms.

Author information: (1)Mt Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, NY 14608, USA.	Cortisol regulation was investigated in a sample of school-aged maltreated (n =  175) and demographically comparable low-income nonmaltreated (n = 209) children  in the context of a day camp research program. Overall group differences between  maltreated and nonmaltreated children were not found for average morning or  average afternoon cortisol levels. However, significant variations were found  that were based on the subtypes of maltreatment that the children had  experienced. Maltreated children who had been both physically and sexually  abused (as well as neglected or emotionally maltreated) exhibited substantial  elevations in morning cortisol levels; children who had high (>1 SD) cortisol  levels in both the morning and afternoon were also overrepresented in the  multiple abuse group. Developmental timing of maltreatment did not account for  these group differences, whereas the severity of sexual abuse was implicated. In  contrast to the multiple abuse group, a subgroup of physically abused children  showed evidence of a trend toward lower morning cortisol relative to  nonmaltreated children with a significantly smaller decrease in cortisol levels  from morning to afternoon. The findings are discussed in terms of the diversity  of atypical cortisol regulation patterns that are exhibited among maltreated  children.

Author information: (1)Medical College of Wisconsin, USA.	Comment in     Dev Psychopathol. 2001 Summer;13(3):413-8.	Glucocorticoids (GCs), produced by the stress-responsive  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, are well recognized for their regulatory  role in peripheral metabolism. GCs are also known to regulate various brain  functions, with well-described effects on human cognition. Increased GC exposure  in humans-including exposure to the endogenous GC, cortisol-at levels associated  with stress, decreases memory and learning function. These results extend  evidence from in vitro studies of synaptic and cell function and evidence from  animals indicating the GCs can regulate substrates of memory function. While  considerable evidence details these effects in adult humans and animals,  relatively less is know about the effect of GCs on cognitive function in  children and older adults. Investigators have suggested that children,  particularly preschool-aged children, may be vulnerable to adverse consequences  of increased GC secretion resulting from stress and neuropsychiatric diseases  such as depression. Adverse GC effects on memory substrates and memory function  in the adult have also fostered concern that age-related changes, including  changes in GC receptors and changes in circulating cortisol levels, could lead  to age-related increases in the adverse effect of GCs on brain function.  Investigators have reported an association between age-related increases in  cortisol levels and age-related memory decline, but this association may or may  not be due to a direct effect of cortisol on memory substrates. A number of  possible treatment approaches to prevent or remediate adverse GC-induced effects  are under development. In general, the use of safe and effective agents for  blocking adverse GC effects on brain functions including memory may offer  benefits to individuals suffering acute and chronic stressors and could prevent  brain changes relevant to stress, aging, and stress-related neuropsychiatric  diseases.

Author information: (1)Emory University School of Medicine, USA.	Childhood abuse is an important public health problem; however, little is known  about the effects of abuse on the brain and neurobiological development. This  article reviews the behavioral and biological consequences of childhood abuse  and places them in a developmental context. Animal studies show that both  positive and negative events early in life can influence neurobiological  development in unique ways. Early stressors such as maternal separation result  in lasting effects on stress-responsive neurobiological systems, including the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and noradrenergic systems. These  studies also implicate a brain area involved in learning and memory, the  hippocampus. in the long-term consequences of early stress. Clinical studies of  patients with a history of abuse also implicate dysfunction in the HPA axis and  the noradrenergic and hippocampal systems; however, there are multiple questions  related to chronicity of stress, developmental epoch at the time of the  stressor, presence of stress-related psychiatric disorders including  posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. and psychological factors  mediating the response to trauma that need to be addressed in this field of  research. Understanding the effects of abuse on the development of the brain and  neurobiology will nevertheless have important treatment and policy implications.

Early adverse experience as a developmental risk factor for later  psychopathology: evidence from rodent and primate models.	Sánchez MM(1), Ladd CO, Plotsky PM.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Emory University School of  Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. sanchez@rmy.emory.edu	Increasing evidence supports the view that the interaction of perinatal exposure  to adversity with individual genetic liabilities may increase an individual's  vulnerability to the expression of psycho- and physiopathology throughout life.  The early environment appears to program some aspects of neurobiological  development and, in turn, behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and physiological  development. Several rodent and primate models of early adverse experience have  been analyzed in this review, including those that "model" maternal separation  or loss, abuse or neglect, and social deprivation. Accumulating evidence shows  that these early traumatic experiences are associated with long-term alterations  in coping style, emotional and behavioral regulation. neuroendocrine  responsiveness to stress, social "fitness,' cognitive function, brain  morphology, neurochemistry, and expression levels of central nervous system  genes that have been related to anxiety and mood disorders. Studies are underway  to identify important aspects of adverse early experience, such as (a) the  existence of "sensitive periods" during development associated with alterations  in particular output systems. (b) the presence of "windows of opportunity"  during which targeted interventions (e.g., nurturant parenting or  supportive-enriching environment) may prevent or reverse dysfunction, (c) the  identity of gene polymorphisms contributing to the individual's variability in  vulnerability, and (d) a means to translate the timing of these developmental  "sensitive periods" across species.

Field NP(1), Sturgeon SE, Puryear R, Hibbard S, Horowitz MJ.	Author information: (1)Pacific Graduate School of Psychology, Palo Alto, CA 94303, USA.  n.field@pgsp.edu	The impact of object relations on adjustment in conjugal bereavement was  examined. At approximately 6 months postbereavement, 46 midlife bereaved  participants engaged in a narrative interview in which they were asked to  discuss their past relationship with their deceased spouse. The Westen et al.  object relations scoring system was applied to these narratives. Participants  also completed depression and grief-specific symptom measures at 6 months and  again at 14 and 25 months postbereavement. Object relations correlated  differently with grief-specific symptoms and depression: it was more strongly  negatively associated with 6 month postloss grief-specific symptoms while more  strongly negatively correlated with depression at 25 month postloss. In a growth  curve analysis, more mature object relations was also predictive of a faster  rate of decrease in depression over time. The results were discussed in terms of  current theoretical perspectives on what is required in successful adaptation to  conjugal bereavement.

Results from a 20-year longitudinal study.	Jaffee S(1), Caspi A, Moffitt TE, Belsky J, Silva P.	Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin at Madison, USA. s.jaffee@iop.kcl.ac.uk	This 20-year longitudinal study showed that the young adult offspring of teen  mothers are at risk for a range of adverse outcomes including early school  leaving, unemployment, early parenthood, and violent offending. We tested how  much the effect of teen childbearing on offspring outcomes could be accounted  for by social selection (in which a woman's characteristics that make her an  inadequate parent also make her likely to bear children in her teens) versus  social influence (in which the consequences of becoming a teen mother also bring  harm to her children, apart from any characteristics of her own). The results  provided support for both mechanisms. Across outcomes, maternal characteristics  and family circumstances together accounted for approximately 39% of the effect  of teen childbearing on offspring outcomes. Consistent with a social-selection  hypothesis, maternal characteristics accounted for approximately 18% of the  effect of teen childbearing on offspring outcomes; consistent with a  social-influence hypothesis, family circumstances accounted for 21% of the teen  childbearing effect after controlling for maternal characteristics. These  results suggest that public policy initiatives should be targeted not only at  delaying childbearing in the population but at supporting individual at-risk  mothers and their children.

Pagani L(1), Tremblay RE, Vitaro F, Boulerice B, McDuff P.	Author information: (1)Research Unit on Children's Psychosocial Maladjustment, University of  Montreal, PQ, Canada. paganikl@grip.umontreal.ca	This study examined the controversial practice of grade retention and children's  academic and behavioral adjustment using data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study  of Kindergarten Children. We employed an autoregressive modeling technique to  detect the impact of being held back during primary school on subsequent  academic performance and behavioral development until age 12 years. The results  indicate both a short- and long-term negative influence on academic performance  for boys and girls. Children's anxious, inattentive, and disruptive behaviors  persisted and, in some cases, worsened after grade retention. These prospective  associations were long lasting and more pronounced when grade retention occurred  early in primary school. Boys were more vulnerable to the negative influence of  grade retention on academic performance and classroom disruptiveness. Disruptive  behavior in girls was comparatively less associated with long-term consequences  than boys. Nevertheless, girls experienced both short- and long-term academic  performance problems in the aftermath of grade retention. Children's prosocial  behavior appeared unaffected by grade retention. These results are independent  of what would have been expected by the natural course of academic and  behavioral development.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579401002061 PMID: 11393648 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, USA. macfie@email.unc.edu	Dissociation reflects disruptions in the integration of memories, perception,  and identity into a coherent sense of self, and may develop following childhood  maltreatment. The preschool years were identified as an important period for the  development of dissociation. However, prior research has not examined the  development of dissociation during this time. In order to address this gap,  evidence of dissociation in 45 maltreated children, assessed for sexual abuse,  physical abuse, and neglect, was compared with dissociation in 33 nonmaltreated  children. Rather than depend on adult observer reports of behavior, the study  sought to gain an understanding of dissociation from the child's own point of  view. Because self-reports have limitations with such young children, a measure  of dissociation evidenced in children's narrative story-stem completions was  utilized. Maltreated children, especially physically abused children and  sexually abused children, demonstrated more dissociation than did nonmaltreated  children. Moreover, during the preschool period maltreated and nonmaltreated  children followed different trajectories such that dissociation increased for  maltreated children but did not do so for nonmaltreated children. Findings  suggest that although the self is normatively integrated during the preschool  period, it becomes increasingly fragmented for some maltreated children. Results  are discussed in terms of cascading effects of maltreatment throughout  development, and the importance of developmentally sensitive interventions.

MacKinnon-Lewis C(1), Lamb ME, Hattie J, Baradaran LP.	Author information: (1)Center for the Study of Social Issues, University of North Carolina at  Greensboro, 27412-5001, USA.	This study tested an integrative, multipathway model designed to explain  bidirectional effects of the attributions and coercive behaviors of mothers and  sons in the context of a longitudinal study. Subjects were 246 mothers and sons  who were 7-9 years of age. Mothers' and sons' attributions about one another's  intent were significantly related to the aggressiveness of the behavior that  each of them directed toward the other. Boys' earlier aggression did not  significantly predict the mothers' subsequent attributions, whereas mothers'  negative behavior indeed predicted subsequent negative attributions on the part  of the boys. Even after considering children's earlier negative behavior,  children's negative attributions about their mothers helped explain the  aggressiveness of their subsequent behavior. The same was not true for mothers  whose earlier attributions indirectly influenced their subsequent aggressive  behavior.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579401001055 PMID: 11346053 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Young children who commit crime: epidemiology, developmental origins, risk  factors, early interventions, and policy implications.	Loeber R(1), Farrington DP.	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh, USA. loeberr@msx.upmc.edu	An early onset of delinquency prior to age 13 years increases the risk of later  serious, violent, and chronic offending by a factor of 2-3. Also child  delinquents, compared to juveniles who start offending at a later age, tend to  have longer delinquent careers. This article summarizes the report of the Office  of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention's Study Group on Very Young  Offenders, chaired by Rolf Loeber and David P. Farrington. The Study Group,  consisting of 16 scholars and 23 coauthors, worked for 2 years on preparing a  report, undertaking extensive secondary data analyses, and writing chapters in  different speciality areas. The report consists of a state of the art review of  the developmental background of child delinquents. The report also summarizes  risk and protective factors in the individual, family, peer group, school, and  neighborhood that affect that development. Lastly, the report renews relevant  preventive and remedial interventions in the juvenile justice system, families,  peer groups, schools. and neighborhoods, and makes a case for improvement in the  integration of services for child delinquents. Policy recommendations are  presented to improve methods of dealing with child delinquents by juvenile  justice, child welfare, and mental health agencies.

Masten AS(1), Curtis WJ.	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.	This paper examines the conceptual and empirical connections between competence  and psychopathology, two historically rich traditions for the study of  adaptation in development, and what might be gained from their integration.  Historical roots of these two traditions are reviewed, then overlaps in their  definition are considered, with a focus on the ways in which judgments about  competence enter into the nosology of mental disorders. DSM-IV is analyzed from  the perspective of competence, and the debate about "harmful dysfunction" in  defining mental disorder is discussed in relation to competence. Different  models explaining the empirical associations of competence and psychopathology  are delineated, and illustrative empirical evidence is provided. Potential  explanations include confounded concepts and methods, symptoms undermining the  effectiveness of adaptation in the environment, failures in age-salient  developmental tasks leading to emotional and behavioral problems, transactional  influences, shared vulnerability or risk factors producing both kinds of  difficulties, and more complex models. The potential benefits of integrating  competence and psychopathology as two major approaches to adaptation are  discussed in regard to theory, classification of mental disorder, research, and  intervention.

Knowledge on  specific psychosocial risk and protective mechanisms is more limited because of  inadequate attention to measurement issues, person effects on the environment,  and the possibility of genetic mediation. Nevertheless, a range of research  strategies may be used to provide rigorous tests of causal hypotheses; these  have shown the importance of environmentally mediated risks. Challenges for the  future include greater use of such research strategies, improved measures of  psychosocial risks that can be applied to large samples, investigation of  origins of risks, identification of causes of time trends in levels of  psychopathology, delineation of psychosocial effects on lifetime liability,  understanding of environmental effects on the organism, appreciation of  processes involved in developmental programming, and understanding of individual  differences in susceptibility.

Cultural influences on developmental processes and outcomes: implications for  the study of development and psychopathology.	Coll CG(1), Akerman A, Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Education Department and Center for the Study of Human Development, Brown  University, Providence, RI 02912, USA.	The purpose of this paper is to trace the role of culture as an explanatory  construct in developmental processes and outcomes, and its implications in the  understanding of developmental psychopathology. Literature reviews were  conducted by historical period: 1930-1939, 1960-1969, and 1990-1999. The  percentage of the total articles and chapters pertaining to cultural issues  increased as a function of time. Both conceptual and methodological continuities  and discontinuities were observed among the three periods. The preponderance of  comparative studies using deficit models still remains, but more enlightened  alternative conceptual models, within culture studies, and measures of cultural  processes, are emerging. In contrast, although contextual influences are  considered important in developmental psychopathology, the field lags in its  empirical consideration of cultural influences. The need to seriously address  these issues will increase as globalization and rapid cultural change become  even more the norm than the exception.

Luthar SS(1), Suchman NE.	Author information: (1)Teacher's College, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027-6696, USA.	The Relational Psychotherapy Mothers' Group (RPMG), a developmentally informed,  supportive psychotherapy designed to serve heroin-addicted mothers with children  up to 16 years of age, aims at addressing psychosocial vulnerabilities, and  facilitating optimal parenting, among at-risk mothers. We present preliminary  evidence on the efficacy of RPMG as an "add on" treatment in comparison with  standard methadone counseling alone. At the end of the 24-week treatment period,  mothers receiving RPMG plus standard methadone counseling demonstrated lower  levels of risk for child maltreatment, greater involvement with their children,  and more positive psychosocial adjustment than women who received methadone  counseling alone. Children of RPMG participants also reflected fewer problems in  multiple areas. At 6 months posttreatment, RPMG recipients continued to be at a  relative advantage, although the magnitude of group differences was often  attenuated. Notably, urinalyses indicated that RPMG mothers showed greater  improvements in levels of opioid use over time than comparison mothers.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, University of London, UK.	Eighty-two mother-infant dyads, comprising women with psychiatric disorder and  individually matched controls, were followed up over the children's 1st year of  life. The mothers with mental illness consisted of two subgroups: first, 25  severely mentally ill mothers who had been admitted to a psychiatric unit with  their infants; and second, 16 mothers from a community sample meeting research  diagnostic criteria for unipolar, nonpsychotic depression. With the exception of  six dyads in the in-patient group, observations were made of the mother-infant  interaction and the quality of the infant-mother attachment relationship at 12  months. The nature and course of the mothers' illness was also documented.  Although few residual symptoms of maternal mental illness were detected at 1  year postpartum, interactional disturbances were evident among the case group  dyads. A strong association was revealed between infant-mother attachment  quality and maternal diagnosis; a manic episode of illness in the postpartum  period was related to security in the attachment relationship, and psychotic or  nonpsychotic depression was related to insecurity. Concurrent patterns of  mother-infant interaction provided support for this finding.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579400002030 PMID: 10847622 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Ganiban J(1), Barnett D, Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Psychology Department, George Washington University, Washington, DC 20052,  USA.	This longitudinal study investigated the relation between negative reactivity  and attachment in children with Down syndrome (DS). Specifically, we examined  whether extremely low negative reactivity is associated with the enactment and  organization of attachment behaviors. To address this issue 30 infants with DS  (13 female, 17 male) were observed in Ainsworth's Strange Situation at 19 and 27  months. The intensity and duration of distress reactions were coded in 15-s  intervals throughout each Strange Situation episode. Children's distress  intensity during separations from caregivers was used to place children into Low  versus Moderate/High Negative Reactivity groups. In addition, ratings of  infants' social interactive behaviors (contact maintenance, proximity seeking,  distance interaction, resistance, and avoidance) were made for each episode and  used to assess the quality of infants' attachment relationships. The data  indicated that there are high rates of Type A and D insecure attachments within  the DS population at each age studied. However, low negative reactivity was not  consistently related to the activation of the attachment behavioral system, or  associated with insecure attachment relationships. Alternative explanations for  the high rate of insecure attachments are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579400001012 PMID: 10774593 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, The University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.	This paper explores the parenting of drug-dependent women and the contributions  of comorbid psychopathology to their parenting. A sample of 32 children whose  mothers were dependent on opioid drugs during pregnancy and 37 children whose  mothers were not drug users were followed from birth to middle childhood.  Multivariate regression analyses were conducted contrasting whether maternal  substance abuse or psychopathology was more closely linked to parenting  behaviors and continuity in parenting over time. Maternal drug dependence was  related to whether mothers were able to remain primary caregivers for their  children over time, even after controlling for psychopathology. Maternal drug  use was related to unresponsive and negative parenting behavior during  mother-infant interaction, but this relation was largely accounted for by the  effects of comorbid maternal psychopathology on parenting, particularly symptoms  of antisocial and related personality disorders. For those children whose  mothers continued to care for them into middle childhood, perceptions of their  mothers as rejecting were related to maternal antisocial personality and  maternal depression. Substance-abuse treatment for women should be integrated  with interventions addressing their mental health and parenting needs.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579499002400 PMID: 10624734 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Barrera M Jr(1), Castro FG, Bigla A.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe 95287-1104, USA.  manuel.barrera@asu.edu	Epidemiological research shows some ethnic-group differences in the prevalence  of substance use. This approach does not address the question of whether there  are ethnic-group differences in the models that are needed to understand the  development of substance use. For this question we need to understand the  relations between psychological constructs and their trajectories over time. In  this paper we describe some approaches to studying ethnic-group differences in  the predictors of substance use that illustrate probing for mediators,  multisample analyses of structural models, and an experimental trial of a  preventive intervention. Our studies found some ethnic-group differences in the  structure of constructs and the relations between variables, but many  similarities. The challenge for researchers is using appropriate research  methods for studying ethnicity, uncovering the basis for ethnic-group  differences when they occur, knowing when statistical differences are  meaningful, and acknowledging when developmental models are comparable.

Author information: (1)Yale Child Study Center, New Haven, CT 06520, USA. linda.mayes@yale.edu	Within the last decade, many investigators have focused on the physical,  neurodevelopmental, and neuropsychological effects of prenatal cocaine exposure  on infants and young children. Although inconclusive on many crucial issues,  published studies reveal the beginnings of a profile of possible cocaine-related  effects on neuropsychological functions subserving arousal and attention  regulation. That profile is informed by preclinical studies in which important  factors such as duration and type of exposure as well as environmental  conditions may be more adequately controlled. In the developing brain, there are  a number of candidate mechanisms that account for how prenatal cocaine exposure  may interfere with neural ontogeny. This review focuses on the monoamine system,  one of the primary sites of action of cocaine in the adult. In the developing  organism, monoamines play critical trophic roles through all phases of central  nervous system (CNS) ontogeny--cell proliferation, neural migration, growth,  maturation, and synaptogenesis. Because of their trophic role in CNS ontogeny,  cocaine effects on developing nervous system may be mediated in part through  effects on monoamine system ontogeny. In turn, these effects may be expressed  behaviorally in disrupted patterns of arousal and attention regulation given  that these domains are connected intimately to monoaminergic systems.

Frontal brain electrical activity in infants of depressed and nondepressed  mothers: relation to variations in infant behavior.	Dawson G(1), Frey K, Self J, Panagiotides H, Hessl D, Yamada E, Rinaldi J.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Center on Human Development and Disability,  University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.	In previous studies, infants of depressed mothers have been found to exhibit  reduced left frontal brain electrical activity (EEG). The left frontal region  has been hypothesized to mediate social approach behaviors and positive  affective expression. These findings raise important questions about the cause  and nature of atypical EEG patterns in infants of depressed mothers. The present  study begins to address some of these questions by examining whether or not  variations in patterns of frontal brain activity in infants of depressed and  nondepressed mothers are related to variations in infant behavior as observed in  naturalistic situations. If such relations exist, are they specific to certain  behaviors hypothesized to be mediated by the frontal region (i.e., positive  approach behaviors)? Frontal and parietal brain electrical activity was recorded  from 14- to 15-month old infants of depressed versus nondepressed mothers during  a baseline condition and during conditions designed to elicit interest and  positive affect. Infant behavior was observed in naturalistic play conditions,  with and without mother, on a separate day from EEG testing. Mothers provided  information on infant temperament. Infants of depressed mothers showed less  affection and touching of their mothers. For infants of depressed mothers only,  reduced left frontal brain activity was found to be related to lower levels of  affection toward mother, but not to infant temperament. Furthermore, increased  generalized frontal activation was found to be related to higher levels of  negative affect, hostility, and tantrums and aggression. Relations between  infant brain activity and behavior were not found for parietal EEG activity.  These results suggest that infant frontal electrical brain activity is related  to variations in infant behavior, especially those involved in positive  affiliative behavior and the expression and regulation of negative affect. The  nature and cause of atypical patterns of brain activity and question of whether  such atypical patterns of frontal brain activity predispose infants to affective  disorders in later life are discussed.

Author information: (1)Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Annedals Clinics, Göteborg  University, Sweden.	Autism is a developmental disorder with variable severity, occurring at all  levels of cognitive ability and having a number of slightly different clinical  presentations. It is associated with neuropsychological deficits that occur in  other conditions also, but its pattern may be specific to autism. Genetic and  environmental early insults to brain development are etiological determinants of  the disorder. Brain circuitries important for social, communicative, and  integrational purposes have been suggested to be dysfunctional in autism. There  could be at least two different pathways to autism, one connected with primary  temporofrontal dysfunction (and late prenatal-early postnatal origins) and  another linked to primary brain-stem dysfunction (and early prenatal origins).  Further study of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychological processes in autism  will help elucidate not only the pathological mechanisms involved in the  specific syndromes but also the underpinnings of normal brain development.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322-2470, USA.	Motor dysfunction is associated with schizophrenia, and recent longitudinal  studies indicate that it precedes the onset of clinical symptoms. Of particular  interest is the heightened occurrence of involuntary movements, which are  apparent as early as infancy and suggest the presence of subcortical brain  abnormalities. In this article, we present the results of a study of spontaneous  movements in adolescents with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). SPD is a  syndrome that has been shown to be genetically linked with schizophrenia and is  often observed prior to the early adult onset of schizophrenia. Systematic  coding of videotapes of diagnostic interviews revealed that the SPD group showed  significantly more involuntary movements of the head, trunk, and upper limbs  than did normals and adolescents with other personality disorders. There were no  diagnostic group differences in the rate of voluntary movements. Salivary  cortisol, measured before the interview, was positively correlated with  involuntary movements. Taken together, the findings provide further support for  the hypothesized etiologic relation between SPD and schizophrenia. Based on a  neural diathesis-stress model, potential underlying mechanisms are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579499002187 PMID: 10532622 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Gest SD(1), Reed MG, Masten AS.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe 85287-1104, USA.  scott.gest@asu.edu	The reliability and validity of a comprehensive, integrative strategy for  assessing adversity exposure in childhood and adolescence was examined in a  community-based longitudinal study of 205 children. Extensive data from multiple  measures completed by adolescents and their parents regarding chronic and acute  life experiences were aggregated into a Life Chart record of lifetime adversity  exposure. Severity of adversity in three nonoverlapping time spans was rated by  trained judges with excellent interrater reliability. As hypothesized, Family  adversity predominated over all other types of adversity in childhood, remained  salient into midadolescence, and showed considerable stability over time.  Adversity related to an individual's own behavior and psychological functioning  rose to equal prominence by late adolescence. Adversity arising from physical  ailments that were independent of the individual's psychological functioning  declined over time, while adversity arising from the community rose; physical  and community events were uncommon for most individuals but substantial for  some. Results suggest that coherent developmental trends in adversity exposure  may be identified effectively through judges' ratings of severity of adversity  over multiple-year time spans.

Prediction to young-adult adjustment.	Capaldi DM(1), Stoolmiller M.	Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center, Eugene 97401, USA. deborahc@oslc.org	The prediction of young-adult adjustment from early adolescent conduct problems  and depressive symptoms was examined for an at-risk sample of approximately 200  males. Conduct problems and depressive symptoms were expected to show stability  to young adulthood. It was predicted that early adolescent conduct problems  would be associated with a broad range of adjustment problems in young adulthood  due to cumulative adjustment failures. Early adolescent depressive symptoms were  expected particularly to predict poor relationships with parents and peers.  Additive and interactive effects of the two predictors were examined. Conduct  problems and depressive symptoms showed significant stability to young  adulthood. Conduct problems were associated with a broad range of adjustment  problems including continuing problems in peer associations, substance use,  self-esteem, relationships with parents, and new problems in noncompletion of  education, unemployment, driver's license suspensions, and causing pregnancies.  Depressive symptoms predicted particularly to problems in social relationships.  Higher levels of both conduct problems and depressive symptoms in early  adolescence did not predict to increased difficulties for any one outcome over  either problem alone, either due to main or interaction effects. Such  co-occurrence, however, did result in problem outcomes in multiple areas, thus,  the poorest adjustment overall.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579499001959 PMID: 10208356 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455,  USA.	Bowlby's attachment theory is a theory of psychopathology as well as a theory of  normal development. It contains clear and specific propositions regarding the  role of early experience in developmental psychopathology, the importance of  ongoing context, and the nature of the developmental process underlying  pathology. In particular, Bowlby argued that adaptation is always the joint  product of developmental history and current circumstances (never either alone).  Early experience does not cause later pathology in a linear way; yet, it has  special significance due to the complex, systemic, transactional nature of  development. Prior history is part of current context, playing a role in  selection, engagement, and interpretation of subsequent experience and in the  use of available environmental supports. Finally, except in very extreme cases,  early anxious attachment is not viewed as psychopathology itself or as a direct  cause of psychopathology but as an initiator of pathways probabilistically  associated with later pathology.

Author information: (1)Biological Psychiatry Branch, NIMH, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-1272, USA.	Posttraumatic stress disorder is the pathological replay of emotional memory  formed in response to painful, life-threatening, or horrifying events. In  contrast, depression is often precipitated by more social context-related  stressors. New data suggest that different types of life experiences can  differentially impact biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, and behavior at the  level of changes in gene expression. Repeated separation of neonatal rat pups  from their mother results in many long-lasting alterations in biology and  behavior paralleling that in depression, including hypercortisolism. The role of  the amygdala in modulating emotional memory is highlighted, as well as some of  its unique properties such as metaplasticity (i.e., the differential direction  of long-term adaptation, either potentiation or depression) in response to the  same input as a function of the prior history of stimulation. The implications  of these emerging data on the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying  emotional memory emphasize the particular importance of prevention and early  intervention.

Nelson CA(1), Carver LJ.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55105,  USA. canelson@tc.umn.edu	Many aspects of brain development depend on experience. Because the major  macro-morphological events of brain development occur over the first 2-3 years  of postnatal life, this time period can be considered both a period of  opportunity as well as a period of vulnerability. In this paper we describe how  experience with stress early in life can have a negative impact on certain  aspects of brain development, and specifically, those neural circuits that  underlie memory. We also describe the effects of traumatic events on the  development of the neural basis of memory. In support of our argument, we review  the literature on brain, stress, and memory in the context of development. Based  on this review, we suggest that the developing brain is particularly vulnerable  to the harmful physiological effects of stress, which in turn has the potential  to lead to impairments in memory. Unfortunately, there are few empirical data  that directly address this hypothesis. In this context we offer a number of  suggestions for future research.

Author information: (1)University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.	How do clinical observations of repression square with experimental evidence  suggesting that emotionally arousing memories are especially enduring? This  discrepancy can be understood by examining three kinds of memory distortions  that give the impression in a clinical context, of repression. Potentially  traumatic events such as childhood sexual abuse (CSA) may be subject to ordinary  forgetting. Recent research suggests people who fail to understand the sexual  nature of CSA report that they remember it less well. In other words, the event  occurred and it was forgotten, but not "repressed." In addition, people may be  wrong about experiencing a period of forgetting, i.e. the event occurred but was  never forgotten. Finally, people may believe that a particular traumatic event  occurred and was repressed when, in fact, it did not happen in the first place.  Under certain circumstances, some combination of these distortions could lead to  situations that are mistakenly interpreted as repression.

Patterson GR(1), Forgatch MS, Yoerger KL, Stoolmiller M.	Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center, Eugene 97401, USA. carleenr@oslc.org	A trajectory defined by three time-ordered events was offered as a useful  adjunct to building a development theory about antisocial behaviors. A sequence  was defined with significant linkages between antisocial childhood behavior and  early arrest and between early arrest and chronic offending. The majority of  chronic offenders traveled through all three events in the sequence. Each event  in the sequence shared a common process of disrupted family process plus  frequent family transitions and marked social disadvantage. The findings support  the hypothesis that the process that leads to antisocial behaviors at grade four  may also maintain the entire sequence. The level of disrupted process at  initiation and a time-based measure of involvement with deviant peers predicted  which individuals moved forward in the sequence and which did not. The findings  are consistent with the idea that the majority of chronic offending juveniles  follow a trajectory that can be explained by a single theory.

Author information: (1)University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa 35487-0348, USA.	This study examined distorted self- and peer perceptions in aggressive and  nonaggressive boys at preadolescent and early adolescent age levels. Subjects  completed semantic differential ratings of themselves and of their peer partners  following two brief dyadic discussion tasks with competitive inductions and a  game-playing task with a cooperative induction. Subjects also rated their  expectations for self- and peer behavior prior to the two competitive  interaction tasks. Research assistants later rated videotapes of the  interactions. Aggressive boys had more distorted perceptions of dyadic behavior  as they overperceived aggression in their partners and underperceived their own  aggressiveness. These distorted perceptions of aggression carried over for  aggressive boys into the third interaction task with a cooperative induction,  indicating these boys' difficulty in modulating these perceptions when the overt  demand for conflict is no longer present in the situation. Results also  indicated that aggressive boys' perceptions of their own behavior after the  first interaction task is substantially affected by their prior expectations, in  comparison to nonaggressive boys who rely more on their actual behavior to form  their perceptions.

Deater-Deckard K(1), Dodge KA, Bates JE, Pettit GS.	Author information: (1)Institute of Psychiatry, London. k.deater-deckard@iop.bpmf.ac.uk	The aim of this study was to test whether individual risk factors as well as the  number of risk factors (cumulative risk) predicted children's externalizing  behaviors over middle childhood. A sample of 466 European American and 100  African American boys and girls from a broad range of socioeconomic levels was  followed from age 5 to 10 years. Twenty risk variables from four domains (child,  sociocultural, parenting, and peer-related) were measured using in-home  interviews at the beginning of the study, and annual assessments of  externalizing behaviors were conducted. Consistent with past research,  individual differences in externalizing behavior problems were stable over time  and were related to individual risk factors as well as the number of risk  factors present. Particular risks accounted for 36% to 45% of the variance, and  the number of risks present (cumulative risk status) accounted for 19% to 32% of  the variance, in externalizing outcomes. Cumulative risk was related to  subsequent externalizing even after initial levels of externalizing had been  statistically controlled. All four domains of risk variables made significant  unique contributions to this statistical prediction, and there were multiple  clusters of risks that led to similar outcomes. There was also evidence that  this prediction was moderated by ethnic group status, most of the prediction of  externalizing being found for European American children. However, this  moderation effect varied depending on the predictor and outcome variables  included in the model.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579498001709 PMCID: PMC2776047 PMID: 9741678 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The design and analysis of longitudinal studies of development and  psychopathology in context: statistical models and methodological  recommendations.	Willett JB(1), Singer JD, Martin NC.	Author information: (1)Harvard University, Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.	The utility and flexibility of recent advances in statistical methods for the  quantitative analysis of developmental data--in particular, the methods of  individual growth modeling and survival analysis--are unquestioned by  methodologists, but have yet to have a major impact on empirical research within  the field of developmental psychopathology and elsewhere. In this paper, we show  how these new methods provide developmental psychopathologists with powerful  ways of answering their research questions about systematic changes over time in  individual behavior and about the occurrence and timing of life events. In the  first section, we present a descriptive overview of each method by illustrating  the types of research questions that each method can address, introducing the  statistical models, and commenting on methods of model fitting, estimation, and  interpretation. In the following three sections, we offer six concrete  recommendations for developmental psychopathologists hoping to use these  methods. First, we recommend that when designing studies, investigators should  increase the number of waves of data they collect and consider the use of  accelerated longitudinal designs. Second, we recommend that when selecting  measurement strategies, investigators should strive to collect equatable data  prospectively on all time-varying measures and should never standardize their  measures before analysis. Third, we recommend that when specifying statistical  models, researchers should consider a variety of alternative specifications for  the time predictor and should test for interactions among predictors,  particularly interactions between substantive predictors and time. Our goal  throughout is to show that these methods are essential tools for answering  questions about life-span developmental processes in both normal and atypical  populations and that their proper use will help developmental psychopathologists  and others illuminate how important contextual variables contribute to various  pathways of development.

Sullivan ML(1).	Author information: (1)School of Criminal Justice, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ 07102, USA.	Qualitative methods are well suited to advance the understanding of the role of  social context in the development of maladaptation and psychopathology. However,  they have not been widely used by developmental psychopathologists, despite  being utilized in related fields, particularly in the sociological study of  crime and delinquency. This article assesses the potential for the increased use  of qualitative methods in developmental psychopathology and addresses the  challenges involved in integrating them with quantitative research strategies.  The interplay of qualitative and quantitative methods in the study of juvenile  delinquency is reviewed for relevant lessons about both the utility and the  difficulties of integrating the two types of methods. The problem of assessing  continuities and discontinuities over the life course in patterns of antisocial  behavior is discussed as an example of the challenge of integrating  methodological paradigms. Schools of thought about qualitative methods and their  relationship to quantitative research paradigms are identified and compared.  Examples are discussed of narrative life history interviewing and qualitative  observational techniques and of recent research endeavors integrating these  qualitative techniques with quantitative data analyses.

Belsky J(1), Hsieh KH, Crnic K.	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802, USA. jxb@psu.edu	To examine the effects of infant negative emotionality and of mothering and  fathering during the toddler years on 3-year-old boys' externalizing problems  and inhibition, as well as explore the proposition that children vary in their  susceptibility to rearing influence, 125 first-born, Caucasian boys from  maritally intact families were studied. Results revealed that when infant  negativity is measured with objective, replicable, and discriminantly valid  procedures, no relation obtains between it and externalizing problems (nor  inhibition). Moreover, as hypothesized on the basis of prior work, parenting was  a stronger predictor of externalizing problems and inhibition in the case of  children who were highly negative as infants. Mothering proved a stronger  predictor of externalizing problems and fathering of inhibition, with more  negative mothering in the 2nd and 3rd year forecasting higher CBCL-externalizing  scores and less negative fathering in the 2nd and 3rd year and more positive  fathering in the 2nd year forecasting more inhibition at age 3 Implications of  these findings for studies of parental influence are considered.

Gorman-Smith D(1), Tolan P.	Author information: (1)University of Illinois at Chicago, USA.	While research has well documented that urban youth are exposed to increasing  rates of community violence, little is known about what increases risk for  violence exposure, what protects children from exposure to violence, and what  factors reduce the most negative outcomes associated with witnessing violence.  This study expands on current research by evaluating the relations between  exposure to violence, family relationship characteristics and parenting  practices, and aggression and depression symptoms. Data were drawn from a sample  of 245 African-American and Latino boys and their caregivers from economically  disadvantaged inner-city neighborhoods in Chicago. Rates of exposure could not  be predicted from family relationship and parenting characteristics, although  there was a trend for discipline to be related. Exposure to community violence  was related to increases in aggressive behavior and depression over a 1-year  period even after controlling for previous status. Future studies should  continue to evaluate the role of exposure to violence on the development of  youth among different neighborhoods and communities. Implications for  intervention and policy are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579498001539 PMID: 9524810 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Thirty-seven couples observed at play with their  8-11-month-old infants (15 boys, 22 girls) rated their child's internalizing and  externalizing symptoms, and their own coparenting behavior 3 years later.  Teachers also rated child behavior at the 3-year follow-up. Several significant  relationships emerged between observed family process (high  hostility-competitiveness, low family harmony, and high parenting discrepancies  in the triad) at Time 1, and subsequent reports of child and coparenting  behavior at Time 2. Larger parenting discrepancies at Time 1 predicted greater  child anxiety as rated by teachers; greater hostility-competitiveness and lower  harmony forecast higher child aggression. Time 1 family process continued to  predict Time 2 aggression even after controlling for individual and marital  functioning. Several links were also found between distressed family process and  later parental reports of negative coparenting behavior. These parental reports  of coparenting also explained unique variance in concurrent child behavior  ratings. The significance of coparenting as a distinct family construct is  discussed.

Cloninger CR(1), Svrakic NM, Svrakic DM.	Author information: (1)Center for Psychobiology of Personality, Washington University School of  Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.	Normal and abnormal personality development can be quantified in terms of 15  specific steps in the self-organization of character as a complex adaptive  system. Character is measured as three dimensions of Self-directedness,  Cooperativeness, and Self-transcendence, each with five components corresponding  to steps in personality development. Each of these steps is differentially  influenced by heritable temperament dimensions, antecedent steps in character  development, and life experiences. Predictions about the nonlinear dynamics of  personality development, such as equifinality and multifinality, are confirmed  in longitudinal data about individuals representative of the general population.  The stepwise development of character determines large differences between  individuals in their risk of psychopathology, as well as varying degrees of  maturity and health.

Fischer KW(1), Ayoub C, Singh I, Noam G, Maraganore A, Raya P.	Author information: (1)Harvard University Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.	Contrary to the standard assumption that psychopathology stems from  developmental immaturity (retardation, fixation, regression), people diagnosed  with psychopathology typically develop along distinctive pathways in which they  build complex, advanced skills. These pathways are based on adaptation to  trauma, such as maltreatment, or to problems in affective-cognitive regulation,  such as those in autism. They do not fit normative developmental frameworks.  Research has characterized several types of distinctive pathways, especially  those arising from maltreatment; they are marked by normal developmental  complexity but distinctive affective-cognitive organization. In one study  sexually abused depressed adolescent girls admitted for treatment in a mental  hospital described themselves-in-relationships with age-appropriate, complex  developmental levels equal to those of both nonabused depressed girls and other  adolescents. At the same time, they showed a powerful negativity bias  contrasting with the positivity biases of other girls. Many of them produced  dramatic switches in affective-cognitive organization across assessments  contrasting with the similar organization showed by other girls. In another  study toddlers from maltreating families showed a consistent negativity bias in  play and representations of interactions. We show how to portray these  distinctive developmental pathways through the example of Hidden Family  Violence, in which people dissociate their private violent world from their  public, good-citizen world.

Nature and autonomy: an organizational view of social and neurobiological  aspects of self-regulation in behavior and development.	Ryan RM(1), Kuhl J, Deci EL.	Author information: (1)University of Rochester, NY 14627, USA.	The concepts of self-regulation and autonomy are examined within an  organizational framework. We begin by retracing the historical origins of the  organizational viewpoint in early debates within the field of biology between  vitalists and reductionists, from which the construct of self-regulation  emerged. We then consider human autonomy as an evolved behavioral,  developmental, and experiential phenomenon that operates at both neurobiological  and psychological levels and requires very specific supports within higher order  social organizations. We contrast autonomy or true self-regulation with  controlling regulation (a nonautonomous form of intentional behavior) in  phenomenological and functional terms, and we relate the forms of regulation to  the developmental processes of intrinsic motivation and internalization.  Subsequently, we describe how self-regulation versus control may be  characterized by distinct neurobiological underpinnings, and we speculate about  some of the adaptive advantages that may underlie the evolution of autonomy.  Throughout, we argue that disturbances of autonomy, which have both biological  and psychological etiologies, are central to many forms of psychopathology and  social alienation.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Oregon State University, Corvallis 97331-5303, USA.	Self-organization can be approached in terms of developmental processes  occurring within and between component systems of temperament. Within-system  organization involves progressive shaping of cortical representations by  subcortical motivational systems. As cortical representations develop, they feed  back to provide motivational systems with enhanced detection and guidance  capabilities. These reciprocal influences may amplify the underlying  motivational functions and promote excessive impulsivity or anxiety. However,  these processes also depend upon interactions arising between motivational and  attentional systems. We discuss these between-system effects by considering the  regulation of approach motivation by reactive attentional processes related to  fear and by more voluntary processes related to effortful control. It is  suggested than anxious and impulsive psychopathology may reflect limitations in  these dual means of control, which can take the form of overregulation as well  as underregulation.

Cowen EL(1), Wyman PA, Work WC, Kim JY, Fagen DB, Magnus KB.	Author information: (1)Center for Community Studies, Univ. of Rochester, NY 14620, USA.	Reports follow-up study of 181 young highly stressed urban children, classified  as stress-resilient (SR) and stress-affected (SA) 1 1/2-2 years earlier. At  follow-up (T2), children were retested on five initial (T1) test measures:  self-rated adjustment, perceived competence, social problem solving, realistic  control attributions, and empathy; parents and teachers did new child adjustment  ratings, and parents participated in a phone interview focusing on the T1-T2  interval. Child test and adjustment measures and parent interview responses at  T2 sensitively differentiated children classified as SR and SA at T1. Test and  interview variables used at T1 and T2 correlated moderately across time periods.  At T2, four child test indicators (i.e., rule conformity, global self-worth,  social problem solving, and realistic control attributions) and four parent  interview variables (positive future expectations for the child, absence of  predelinquency indicators, good parent mental health in the past year, and  adaptive parent coping strategies) sensitively differentiated children  classified as SR and SA at T1. No relationship was found between family stress  experienced in the T1-T2 interval and changes in children's adjustment during  that period.

Author information: (1)College of Social and Behavioral Science, University of Utah, Salt Lake City  84112, USA.	Interactive coordination was observed in laboratory play interactions of pairs  of 29 clinically depressed and 14 nondepressed mothers and their 13-29-month-old  children (M = 18.9 months). Nondepressed mothers and their children displayed  more interactive coordination than depressed-mother dyads (p < .001). Depressed  mothers were less likely to repair interrupted interactions, and their toddlers  were less likely to maintain interactions than nondepressed controls. Toddlers  matched their nondepressed but not their depressed mothers negative behavior  rates. Results suggested that early interventions focus on training mothers to  attend to maintain, and repair mother-child interactions to more closely  approximate normal levels of interactive coordination.

Teti DM(1), Gelfand DM.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore,  MD 21250, USA.	Construct validity of the newly developed Preschool Assessment of Attachment  (PAA) was examined in a sample of depressed and nondepressed mothers and their  preschoolers, focusing on attachment related differences in children's general  caregiving environments, maternal psychosocial functioning, and child behavior  during interactions with mother. Mothers of secure children were more  emotionally and verbally responsive to their children than were mothers of  insecure children, and secure children were emotionally more positive to their  mothers than were insecure children. Mothers of secure children also reported  higher levels of social supports than did mothers of insecure children. Finally,  dyads with children who lacked unitary, coherent attachment strategies (i.e.,  anxious depressed, defended/coercive, and insecure other) showed the worst  functioning in all domains relative to all other attachment groups. Similar but  slightly less robust findings were obtained with socioeconomic variables  statistically controlled. These results lend support to the PAA as a valid  system for the conceptualization and measurement of quality of attachment among  preschoolers. Future research applications with the PAA are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579497001284 PMID: 9327237 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Relationship of prenatal cocaine exposure and maternal postpartum psychological  distress to child developmental outcome.	Singer L(1), Arendt R, Farkas K, Minnes S, Huang J, Yamashita T.	Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine,  Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.	Maternal cocaine use during pregnancy can affect the infant directly through  toxic effects or indirectly through cocaine's influence on maternal  psychological status. We followed 160 cocaine exposed and 56 nonexposed infants  and their mothers identified at birth through interview and/or urine screen.  Although cocaine exposure defined the groups, infant exposure to alcohol,  marijuana, and tobacco was allowed to vary. Infants were 99% African American  and poor. All mothers completed the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and infants  were given the Bayley Scales of Mental (MDI) and Motor (PDI) Development at a  mean corrected age of 17 +/- 8 months. Both MDIs (94 +/- 17 vs. 103 +/- 16) and  PDIs (101 +/- 16 vs. 108 +/- 12) were lower for cocaine exposed infants.  Psychological distress was greater in cocaine using mothers. Hierarchical  multiple regression was used to assess the relative effects of gestational age,  maternal psychological distress, and cocaine and polydrug exposure on infant  outcomes. Both psychological distress and cocaine and alcohol exposure predicted  lower MDIs after controlling for prematurity. Neither psychological distress nor  alcohol exposure predicted motor outcome, while cocaine had a significant  effect. Tobacco and marijuana exposure were unrelated to outcome. These findings  provide further support for direct effects of cocaine and alcohol on infant  development as well as highlight the need for studies to document maternal  psychological factors, which may increase child risk for poorer outcomes.

Yeung-Courchesne R(1), Courchesne E.	Author information: (1)Children's Hospital Research Center, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.	The incomplete interface between remediation-oriented research and basic science  research has hampered progress toward gaining insight into the etiologies of  autism, despite the availability of abundant research data. Investigators of  these two research domains differ in their background training and primary  goals, which necessarily affect their missions, perspectives, research questions  posed, methodologies selected, and interpretation of data from the research.  Miscommunication between the two types of researchers has brought about  disagreement on nearly every aspect of the research process. We discuss both  sides of the impasse: a traditional clinical practice perspective based on the  requirement for finding immediate answers to the remediation question and the  basic science perspective with the goal of delineating the sequence of  biological changes from the initial cause(s) of abnormal development to  behavioral outcome. Although remediation-oriented research aims at alleviation  of symptoms for today's patients, we propose that a basic science perspective  seeks insight into the triggering causes and pathogenesis of the disorder from  which better diagnosis and remediation may be devised for patients in the  future. We suggest that research in autism can progress beyond the impasse of  disagreement and competition toward information integration and insight by means  of dialogue, data exchange, discussion, collaboration, and cooperation.

Beardslee WR(1), Versage EM, Wright EJ, Salt P, Rothberg PC, Drezner K,  Gladstone TR.	Author information: (1)Judge Baker Children's Center, Boston, MA 02115, USA.	Thirty-seven families who had a child between the ages of 8 and 15 (mean age =  12.0 years) and had at least one parent, who had experienced a recent episode of  affective disorder were assigned randomly to one of two psychoeducational  interventions. The interventions (clinician-facilitated or lecture-group  discussion) were designed to prevent childhood depression and related problems  through decreasing the impact of related risk factors and encouraging  resiliency-promoting behaviors and attitudes. They were similar in content but  differed in the level of the children's involvement and the degree to which the  families' individual life experiences were linked to the educational material.  Assessments included standard diagnostic and social functioning instruments and  interviews designed specifically for this project to assess behavior and  attitude change. Each parent and child was individually assessed by separate  assessors who were blind to information about the other family members. Parent  participants in both groups reported being satisfied with the intervention.  Clinician group participants reported a significantly larger number of overall  changes, as well as higher levels of change regarding communications about the  illness with their children and increased understanding by the children of their  illness. Significantly more children in the clinician group also reported they  gained a better understanding of parental affective illness as a result of their  participation in the project.

Vallance DD(1), Wintre MG.	Author information: (1)C. M. Hincks Treatment Centre/Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.	Children with both a language impairment and a learning disability are at risk  for poor social competence. Yet the processes that place these children at risk  remain unclear. A developmental-organizational perspective was used to explore  processes underlying risk for poor social competence among language learning  disable children. To this end, the relative influences of language learning  disability and social discourse skills on social competence were examined in 50  language learning disabled (LLD) and 50 control (non-LLD) children aged 8-12  years. Findings indicated that social discourse skills mediated the relation  between LLD status and children's social competence. Specifically, a domain of  social discourse, figurative language, was the strongest mediator of the effect  of LLD status on social competence. Additionally, differences were confirmed  between the LLD and non-LLD group in two domains of social discourse, recreating  sentences and figurative language, as well as social competence. Two other  domains of social discourse, understanding ambiguous sentences and making  inferences, did not discriminate the groups. The findings emphasize the  importance of analyzing interrelations among domains to identify critical  factors related to developmental outcomes.

Author information: (1)Sub-Department of Clinical Health Psychology, University College London, UK.  t.charman@ucl.ac.uk	There is considerable, evidence that the development of joint attention and  pretend play skills are impaired in children with autism. Some accounts of  autistic psychopathology give a crucial role to early impairments in joint  attention and suggest that these lead to impoverished development of the  representational abilities that underlie the later emerging impairments in  pretend play and theory of mind. Other accounts of impairments in joint  attention and pretend play see them merely as symptoms of a more basic  underlying cognitive deficit, in attention or executive function. This review  examines the evidence for the possible relationships that may exist between  joint attention and pretend play and the later development of a theory of mind.  It also suggests directions for future work to clarify the relationship between  the two skills and to identify the nature of the underlying primary deficit in  autism.

How matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 (rs3918242) polymorphism affects MMP-9  serum concentration and associates with autism spectrum disorders: A  case-control study in Iranian population.	Lord JR(1), Mashayekhi F(1), Salehi Z(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Guilan, Rasht,  Guilan, Iran.	The aim of this project was to evaluate the relationship of matrix  metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) genetic variation and its serum concentration with  autism spectrum disorder (ASD). One hundred ASD and 120 controls were enrolled  in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and MMP-9 polymorphism was  determined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism  and serum levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The  frequencies of CC, CT, and TT genotypes were 72%, 26%, and 2% in controls and  31%, 57%, and 12% in ASD, respectively. The frequencies of C and T alleles in  ASD were 59.5% and 40.5%, and controls were 86% and 14%, respectively. There is  a significant increase in serum MMP-9 levels in ASD as compared to controls. We  have also shown that TT genotype is significantly associated with increase serum  MMP-9 levels in patients (TT, CT, and CC serum levels were 91.77 ± 10.53, 70.66  ± 7.21, and 38.66 ± 5.52 and in controls were 55.55 ± 11.39, 42.66 ± 7.85, and  30.55 ± 6.34 ng/ml, respectively). It is concluded that there is a significant  association between rs3918242 MMP-9 polymorphism and its serum concentration  with autism. We also suggest that TT genotype is associated with increased MMP9  expression and may be a risk factor for ASD.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420002102 PMID: 33517948

Children who spend their early lives in institutions experience profound  psychosocial deprivation that is associated with altered stress response system  development. Here, we used data from a longitudinal randomized controlled trial  of foster care for institutionally reared children to examine whether caregiving  quality and stressful life events (SLEs) in early adolescence (age 12) influence  patterns of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous  system (SNS) reactivity. Controlling for the effect of institutional care,  higher caregiving quality at age 12 was associated with heightened cortisol and  SNS reactivity. However, moderation analysis revealed that the latter effect was  only observed among never-institutionalized children, whereas  ever-institutionalized children demonstrated a persistently blunted SNS response  regardless of recent caregiving quality. Among institutionally reared children,  SLEs interacted with prior random assignment to foster care, such that those  placed in foster care early in development had a SNS response that approximated  never-institutionalized children when SLEs at age 12 were low. In contrast, SNS  reactivity was persistently blunted among those with prolonged deprivation,  regardless of recent SLEs. Early-life deprivation is associated with persistent  blunting of stress response systems, but normalization may be achievable if SLEs  are limited following placement into enriched family-based care.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD) are believed to share partially overlapping causal mechanisms suggesting  that early risk markers may also overlap. Using latent profile analysis (LPA) in  a sample of infants enriched for ASD and ADHD, we first examined the number of  distinct groups of 3-year-old children, based on ADHD and ASD symptomatology. To  investigate early predictors of ASD and ADHD symptom profiles, we next examined  differences in trajectories of infant behaviors among the LPA classes spanning  general development, negative affect, attention, activity level, impulsivity,  and social behavior. Participants included 166 infants at familial risk for ASD  (n = 89), ADHD (n = 38), or low-risk for both (n = 39) evaluated at 12, 18, 24,  and 36 months of age. A three-class solution was selected reflecting a Typically  Developing (TD) class (low symptoms; n = 108), an ADHD class (high ADHD/low ASD  symptoms; n = 39), and an ASD class (high ASD/ADHD symptoms; n = 19).  Trajectories of infant behaviors were generally suggestive of a gradient pattern  of differences, with the greatest impairment within the ASD class followed by  the ADHD class. These findings indicate a mixture of overlapping and distinct  early markers of preschool ASD- and ADHD-like profiles that can be difficult to  disentangle early in life.

Negriff S(1).	Author information: (1)Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Department of Research & Evaluation,  Pasadena, CA, USA.	The current study extends knowledge regarding the individual contribution of  different adverse experiences to mental health symptoms in late adolescence by  including the perception of how upsetting each experience was to the adolescent  and the age at the first occurrence. We also sought to move beyond sum scores of  adverse experiences by using a person-centered approach to classifying  individuals with similar co-occurrence of adversities. The data came from a  longitudinal study of maltreatment on adolescent development (N = 454).  Self-reported childhood adversities were assessed at Wave 4 (average of 7 years  postbaseline) and examined with respect to current mental health symptoms  (depression, PTSD, anxiety, and externalizing). Although the adversity sum score  was a potent predictor of all mental health outcomes, the results indicated that  the use of a sum score obscures information about the importance of individual  adversities. Additionally, the influence of age of occurrence varied based on  the adversity and outcome, while the perception of the event did not add much  unique variance. Finally, the latent class analyses provided unique information  about the patterns of co-occurring adversity in this sample, and that membership  in either of the multiple-adversity classes was associated with more mental  health symptoms.

Theoretical models of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder implicate  neurocognitive dysfunction, yet neurocognitive functioning covers a range of  abilities that may not all be linked with inattention. This study (a)  investigated the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability (h2SNP) of  inattention and aspects of neurocognitive efficiency (memory, social cognition,  executive function, and complex cognition) based on additive genome-wide  effects; (b) examined if there were shared genetic effects among inattention and  each aspect of neurocognitive efficiency; and (c) conducted an exploratory  genome-wide association study to identify genetic regions associated with  inattention. The sample included 3,563 participants of the Philadelphia  Neurodevelopmental Cohort, a general population sample aged 8-21 years who  completed the Penn Neurocognitive Battery. Data on inattention was obtained with  the Kiddie Schedule of Affective Disorders (adapted). Genomic relatedness matrix  restricted maximum likelihood was implemented in genome-wide complex trait  analysis. Analyses revealed significant h2SNP for inattention (20%, SE = 0.08),  social cognition (13%, SE = 0.08), memory (17%, SE = 0.08), executive function  (25%, SE = 0.08), and complex cognition (24%, SE = 0.08). There was a positive  genetic correlation (0.67, SE = 0.37) and a negative residual covariance (-0.23,  SE = 0.06) between inattention and social cognition. No SNPs reached genome-wide  significance for inattention. Results suggest specificity in genetic overlap  among inattention and different aspects of neurocognitive efficiency.

HPA-axis multilocus genetic profile score moderates the association between  maternal prenatal perceived stress and offspring depression in early adulthood.	McKenna BG(1), Hammen C(2), Brennan PA(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA. (2)Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles,  CA, USA.	Maternal stress during pregnancy can cause alterations to the fetal  hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a phenomenon known as fetal  programming that may have lasting effects on offspring outcomes, including  depression. Evidence suggests that these effects may vary with respect to the  offspring's genetic risk. Nonetheless, few studies have examined these effects  into adulthood, when risk for depression onset is highest. The present study  builds upon the extant literature by examining the interaction of maternal  prenatal perceived stress (MPPS) and offspring HPA-axis polygenic risk to  predict offspring depression in early adulthood. A total of 381 mother-child  dyads participated in a prospective, longitudinal study that spanned from  pregnancy until offspring were 20 years of age. Polygenic risk was defined by a  multilocus genetic profile score (MGPS) that reflected the additive risk of  three HPA-axis candidate genes. The results indicated that the interaction of  MPPS and HPA-axis MGPS confers risk for offspring depression at age 20, in line  with the differential susceptibility model. This interaction may be specific to  prenatal stress, as maternal stress during early childhood did not interact with  genetic risk to predict depression. These findings provide the first evidence  that genetic variants that are associated with the HPA axis may act in a  polygenic, additive fashion to moderate the association between fetal  programming and adult depression.

Studies suggest that the relationship between psychosocial well-being and type 1  diabetes (T1D) is bidirectional, with T1D typically having a negative influence  on psychological functioning, which in turn negatively affects the course of  T1D. Here, we investigate the potential role of the capacity for mentalizing, or  reflective functioning, in children and their mothers in diabetes control. We  tested differences in mentalizing as assessed by the Reflective Functioning  Scale in two groups of mother-son dyads with good (GDC) versus poor (PDC)  diabetes control. Fifty-five boys (8-12 years old) and their mothers were  recruited from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation in Santiago, Chile. The mothers  were interviewed with the Parental Development Interview and the children with  the Child Attachment Interview, and both were scored for reflective functioning  by using the Reflective Functioning Scale. Self-report measures of stress and  diabetes outcomes were completed by the mothers and children, and levels of  glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were assessed as an index of diabetes control. The  results showed that both maternal and child reflective functioning were higher  in the GDC than the PDC group and were negatively correlated with HbA1c in the  total sample. Our findings suggest an important role for mentalizing in diabetes  outcomes, but further prospective research is needed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001706 PMID: 31931891

Childhood adversity is associated with poor mental and physical health outcomes  across the life span. Alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are  considered a key mechanism underlying these associations, although findings have  been mixed. These inconsistencies suggest that other aspects of stress  processing may underlie variations in this these associations, and that  differences in adversity type, sex, and age may be relevant. The current study  investigated the relationship between childhood adversity, stress perception,  and morning cortisol, and examined whether differences in adversity type  (generalized vs. threat and deprivation), sex, and age had distinct effects on  these associations. Salivary cortisol samples, daily hassle stress ratings, and  retrospective measures of childhood adversity were collected from a large sample  of youth at risk for serious mental illness including psychoses (n = 605, mean  age = 19.3). Results indicated that childhood adversity was associated with  increased stress perception, which subsequently predicted higher morning  cortisol levels; however, these associations were specific to threat exposures  in females. These findings highlight the role of stress perception in stress  vulnerability following childhood adversity and highlight potential sex  differences in the impact of threat exposures.

In their commentary, Beauchaine and Slep (2018) raise important issues regarding  research on behavioral parenting training (BPT). In this reply we highlight key  points of agreement and respond to issues that we feel require clarification.  BPT has been repeatedly proven effective in decreasing disruptive child behavior  (also in the work of our research team). Yet, there is much to learn about for  whom and how BPT is effective. Specifically, assessing the how (i.e., mediation)  comes with many challenges. One of these challenges is taking into account the  timeline of change, and being able to infer causal mechanisms of change. We  argue that cross-lagged panel models (which we, and many other scholars, used)  are a valid and valuable method for testing mediation. At the same time, our  results raise important questions, specifically about the timing and form of  expected changes in parenting and child behavior after BPT. For example, are  these changes linear and gradual or do they happen more suddenly? To select the  appropriate design, assessment tools, and statistical models to test mediation,  we need to state detailed hypotheses on what changes when. An important next  step might be to assess multiple putative mediators on different timescales, not  only before and after, but specifically also during BPT.

Interparental conflict, children's security with parents, and long-term risk of  internalizing problems: A longitudinal study from ages 2 to 10.	Brock RL(1), Kochanska G(1).	Author information: (1)University of Iowa.	Although the negative impact of marital conflict on children has been amply  documented, few studies have examined the process of risk in a long-term,  longitudinal design. We examined parent-child attachment security as a mechanism  that may account for the impact of interparental conflict on children's  long-term risk of internalizing problems. Sixty-two community mothers, fathers,  and children were followed from ages 2 to 10. Parents reported on their  conflicts when their children were 2. Trained observers produced parent-child  attachment security scores (Attachment Q-Set, Waters, 1987), based on lengthy  naturalistic observations of the child with each parent. Parents rated  children's internalizing problems at age 10. A conditional process model and  bootstrap approach were implemented to examine conditional indirect effects of  conflict on child internalizing problems through attachment security for girls  versus boys. Maladaptive marital conflict (destructive strategies, severity of  arguments) increased internalizing problems 8 years later due to the undermined  security for girls, whereas negative emotional aftermath of conflict  (unresolved, lingering tension) increased internalizing problems for both boys  and girls. The emotional aftermath of conflict is often overlooked, yet it  appears to be a key dimension influencing emotional security in the family  system, with significant consequences for children's development.

O'Dougherty Wright M(1), Fopma-Loy J, Oberle K.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, 90 North Patterson Avenue, Miami University,  Oxford, OH 45056, USA. wrightmo@muohio.edu	This article reviews past research on the parenting characteristics of childhood  sexual abuse survivors and presents the results of a qualitative study exploring  the women's perspectives on mothering as a survivor. Grounded theory was used in  the collection and analysis of the data. Data sources included the narrative  responses of 79 women (mean age = 38.2 years) and in-depth interviews of a  purposive sample of 15 women (mean age = 39 years). They had an average of 2.2  children, ranging in age from 5 months to young adulthood. The theoretical model  identified through analysis of data using the constant comparison method was  entitled "The Hard Work of Mothering as a Survivor." Processes emerged that  described the ways participants managed the work of mothering in light of  memories of the abuse and attempts to heal from this earlier trauma. The  conditions for committing to the work included becoming aware of and accepting  the reality of the abuse and how it affected one's life, and taking on the hard  work of developing a mothering self. This included expanding awareness,  developing and evaluating a personal model of mothering, navigating typical and  abuse salient parenting challenges, mothering through the pain of recovery, and  battling for balance. The findings highlighted the dynamic, multifaceted nature  of recovery and resilience for these mothers and the need for an increased focus  on parenting in counseling with childhood sexual abuse survivors. Provision of  anticipatory guidance regarding commonly experienced stressors at varying stages  of the child's development and the mother's stage of recovery and methods for  coping with these challenges, would benefit these mothers and promote parenting  competence. Specific implications for psychotherapy and directions for future  research are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412000144 PMID: 22559129 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Dawson G(1), Webb S, Schellenberg GD, Dager S, Friedman S, Aylward E, Richards  T.	Author information: (1)Center of Human Development and Disability, University of Washington, Seattle  98195, USA.	Achieving progress in understanding the cause, nature, and treatment of autism  requires an integration of concepts, approaches, and empirical findings from  genetic, cognitive neuroscience, animal, and clinical studies. The need for such  integration has been a fundamental tenet of the discipline of developmental  psychopathology from its inception. It is likely that the discovery of autism  susceptibility genes will depend on the development of dimensional measures of  broader phenotype autism traits. It is argued that knowledge of the cognitive  neuroscience of social and language behavior will provide a useful framework for  defining such measures. In this article, the current state of knowledge of the  cognitive neuroscience of social and language impairments in autism is reviewed.  Following from this, six candidate broader phenotype autism traits are proposed:  (a) face processing, including structural encoding of facial features and face  movements, such as eye gaze; (b) social affiliation or sensitivity to social  reward, pertaining to the social motivational impairments found in autism; (c)  motor imitation ability, particularly imitation of body actions; (d) memory,  specifically those aspects of memory mediated by the medial temporal  lobe-prefrontal circuits; (e) executive function, especially planning and  flexibility; and (f) Language ability, particularly those aspects of language  that overlap with specific language impairment, namely, phonological processing.

Child language and parenting antecedents and externalizing outcomes of emotion  regulation pathways across early childhood: A person-centered approach.

(3)University of North Carolina-Charlotte.	Decreases in children's anger reactivity because of the onset of their  autonomous use of strategies characterizes the prevailing model of the  development of emotion regulation in early childhood (Kopp, 1989). There is,  however, limited evidence of the varied pathways that mark this development and  their proposed antecedents and consequences. This study used a person-centered  approach to identify such pathways, antecedents, and outcomes. A sample of 120  children from economically strained rural and semirural households were observed  while waiting to open a gift at ages 24, 36, and 48 months. Multitrajectory  modeling of children's anger expressions and strategy use yielded three  subgroups. As they aged, typically developing children's strategy use (calm bids  and focused distraction) increased while anger expressions decreased. Later  developing children, though initially elevated in anger expression and low in  strategy use, demonstrated marked growth across indicators and did not differ  from typically developing children at 48 months. At-risk children, despite  developing calm bidding skills, did not display longitudinal self-distraction  increases or anger expression declines. Some predicted antecedents (12-24 month  child language skills and language-capitalizing parenting practices) and  outcomes (age 5 years externalizing behavior) differentiated pathways. Findings  illustrate how indicator-specific departures from typical pathways signal risk  for behavior problems and point to pathway-specific intervention opportunities.

Parenting practices in middle childhood mediate the relation between growing up  with a parent having bipolar disorder and offspring psychopathology from  childhood into early adulthood.	Iacono V(1), Beaulieu L(1), Hodgins S(2), Ellenbogen MA(1).	Author information: (1)Concordia University,Montréal. (2)Université de Montréal.	The offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (OBD) are at high risk for  developing mental disorders. In addition to genetic factors, environmental risk  is purported to be associated with these negative outcomes. However, few studies  have examined this relation. Using concurrent and longitudinal data, we examined  if support, structure, and control provided by parents in middle childhood  mediated the relation between having a parent with or without bipolar disorder,  and offspring mental health. The sample included 145 offspring (77 OBD, 68  controls) aged 4 to 14 years and their parents. Parent and teacher ratings of  child behavior were collected, and diagnostic assessments were conducted in  offspring 12 years later (n = 101). Bootstrapping analyses showed that low  levels of structure mediated the relation between having a parent with bipolar  disorder and elevated internalizing and externalizing difficulties during middle  childhood. For the longitudinal outcomes, parental control emerged as the  strongest mediator of the relation between parents' bipolar disorder and  offspring psychopathology. Suboptimal childrearing may have different immediate  and enduring consequences on mental health outcomes in the OBD. Parental  structure has robust effects on emotional and behavioral problems in middle  childhood, while levels of control promote psychological adjustment in the OBD  as they mature.

Negriff S(1).	Author information: (1)University of Southern California.	Although delinquency, substance use, and sexual activity are established to be  highly intercorrelated, the extant research provides minimal evidence in support  of one particular sequence of risk behavior or on the cascade effects from  maltreatment. The present study tested a longitudinal model incorporating  maltreatment, deviant peers, sexual behavior, delinquency, and substance use to  elucidate the sequential pathway(s) from maltreatment to each specific risk  behavior throughout adolescence. Data came from a longitudinal study on the  effects of maltreatment on adolescent development (N = 454) with four study  assessments from early (Time 1 M age = 10.98) to late adolescence (Time 4 M age  = 18.22). Results from the cross-lagged model showed a sequence from  maltreatment to sexual behavior (Time 1), to delinquency (Time 2), to sexual  behavior (Time 3), to substance use and delinquency (Time 4). These findings  support sexual behavior as the initial risk behavior that is the catalyst for  engagement in more advanced risk behaviors across adolescence.

Visual systemizing preference in children with autism: A randomized controlled  trial of intranasal oxytocin.

Several studies have suggested that the neuropeptide oxytocin may enhance  aspects of social communication in autism. Little is known, however, about its  effects on nonsocial manifestations, such as restricted interests and repetitive  behaviors. In the empathizing-systemizing theory of autism, social deficits are  described along the continuum of empathizing ability, whereas nonsocial aspects  are characterized in terms of an increased preference for patterned or  rule-based systems, called systemizing. We therefore developed an automated  eye-tracking task to test whether children and adolescents with autism spectrum  disorder (ASD) compared to matched controls display a visual preference for more  highly organized and structured (systemized) real-life images. Then, as part of  a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, we examined the  effect of intranasal oxytocin on systemizing preferences in 16 male children  with ASD, compared with 16 matched controls. Participants viewed 14 slides, each  containing four related pictures (e.g., of people, animals, scenes, or objects)  that differed primarily on the degree of systemizing. Visual systemizing  preference was defined in terms of the fixation time and count for each image.  Unlike control subjects who showed no gaze preference, individuals with ASD  preferred to fixate on more highly systemized pictures. Intranasal oxytocin  eliminated this preference in ASD participants, who now showed a similar  response to control subjects on placebo. In contrast, control participants  increased their visual preference for more systemized images after receiving  oxytocin versus placebo. These results suggest that, in addition to its effects  on social communication, oxytocin may play a role in some of the nonsocial  manifestations of autism.

Author information: (1)University of Minnesota. (2)University of North Carolina at Greensboro. (3)University of Zürich.	We examined associations between specific self-regulatory mechanisms and  externalizing behavior patterns from ages 2 to 15 (N = 443). The relation  between multiple self-regulatory indicators across multiple domains (i.e.,  physiological, attentional, emotional, and behavioral) at age 2 and at age 5 and  group membership in four distinct externalizing trajectories was examined. By  examining each of these self-regulatory processes in combination with one  another, and therefore accounting for their shared variance, we aimed to better  understand which specific self-regulatory skills were associated most strongly  with externalizing behavioral patterns. Findings suggest that behavioral  inhibitory control and emotion regulation are particularly important in  distinguishing between children who show normative declines in externalizing  behaviors across early childhood and those who demonstrate high levels through  adolescence.

(3)Virginia Commonwealth University. (4)Duke University. (5)Auburn University.	The current study used data from two longitudinal samples to test whether  self-regulation, depressive symptoms, and aggression/antisociality were  mediators in the relation between a polygenic score indexing serotonin (5-HT)  functioning and alcohol use in adolescence. The results from an independent  genome-wide association study of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the cerebrospinal  fluid were used to create 5-HT polygenic risk scores. Adolescents and/or parents  reported on adolescents' self-regulation (Time 1), depressive symptoms (Time 2),  aggression/antisociality (Time 2), and alcohol use (Time 3). The results showed  that 5-HT polygenic risk did not predict self-regulation. However, adolescents  with higher levels of 5-HT polygenic risk showed greater depression and  aggression/antisociality. Adolescents' aggression/antisociality mediated the  relation between 5-HT polygenic risk and later alcohol use. Deficits in  self-regulation also predicted depression and aggression/antisociality, and  indirectly predicted alcohol use through aggression/antisociality. Pathways to  alcohol use were especially salient for males from families with low parental  education in one of the two samples. The results provide insights into the  longitudinal mechanisms underlying the relation between 5-HT functioning and  alcohol use (i.e., earlier aggression/antisociality). There was no evidence that  genetically based variation in 5-HT functioning predisposed individuals to  deficits in self-regulation. Genetically based variation in 5-HT functioning and  self-regulation might be separate, transdiagnostic risk factors for several  types of psychopathology.

Genetic moderation of multiple pathways linking early cumulative socioeconomic  adversity and young adults' cardiometabolic disease risk.	Wickrama KAS(1), Lee TK(2), O'Neal CW(1).	Author information: (1)University of Georgia. (2)University of Miami.	Recent research suggests that psychosocial resources and life stressors are  mediating pathways explaining socioeconomic variation in young adults' health  risks. However, less research has examined both these pathways simultaneously  and their genetic moderation. A nationally representative sample of 11,030  respondents with prospective data collected over 13 years from the National  Study of Adolescent to Adult Health was examined. First, the association between  early cumulative socioeconomic adversity and young adults' (ages 25-34)  cardiometabolic disease risk, as measured by 10 biomarkers, through psychosocial  resources (educational attainment) and life stressors (accelerated transition to  adulthood) was examined. Second, moderation of these pathways by the serotonin  transporter linked polymorphic region gene (5-HTTLPR) was examined. There was  evidence for the association between early socioeconomic adversity and young  adults' cardiometabolic disease risk directly and indirectly through educational  attainment and accelerated transitions. These direct and mediating pathways were  amplified by the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism. These findings elucidate how early  adversity can have an enduring influence on young adults' cardiometabolic  disease risk directly and indirectly through psychosocial resources and life  stressors and their genetic moderation. This information suggests that effective  intervention and prevention programs should focus on early adversity, youth  educational attainment, and their transition to young adulthood.

Zimmer-Gembeck MJ(1), Webb HJ(1), Farrell LJ(1), Waters AM(1).	Author information: (1)Griffith University and Menzies Health Institute of Queensland.	Adolescents' appearance-related concerns can provoke increasing emotional,  social, and eating-related problems. The aims of this five-wave (2.5-year),  multiple-informant longitudinal study were to (a) examine growth trajectories of  appearance anxiety symptoms and appearance esteem, (b) identify whether  trajectories differed by gender, and (c) examine several launching factors  including parent-reported physical maturation, peer-rated physical appearance,  body mass index, and appearance teasing by parents and peers. Participants were  387 adolescents (44% boys) aged 10 to 13 years at the first assessment. Steep  growth in appearance anxiety symptoms was found for both girls and boys, but  there was no average change in appearance esteem. Girls had more elevated  appearance anxiety symptoms and lower appearance esteem than boys, girls' body  mass index was associated with symptoms, and earlier physical maturation and  teasing about appearance, alone and in combination, were associated with growth  in appearance anxiety symptoms for girls and boys. Earlier maturing boys who  were highly teased by parents, but even more so when teased by peers, were at  utmost risk for elevated appearance anxiety symptoms and increasing symptoms  over time. In contrast, all girls exhibited elevated or increasing appearance  anxiety symptoms across time, with the exception of girls with the latest  maturation who also reported little teasing about their appearance.

Using longitudinal data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth  Development, we investigated quality of the early caregiving environment as a  potential prospective buffer against the long-term association between childhood  poverty and adolescent risk taking. Multicategorical moderation model results  indicated that if raised in poverty across age 1-54 months (average family  income to needs ratio ≤ 1.02), relative to affluence (income to needs ratio ≥  6.16), adolescents with histories of secure attachment to caregivers exhibited  two times the number of risk behaviors at age 15, whereas adolescents with  insecure-disorganized histories exhibited nearly five times the number of risk  behaviors. Both early family economic hardship and history of  insecure-disorganized attachment remained significant predictors of increased  adolescent risk taking, alongside the interactive effect. Probing the  interaction's region of significance revealed that history of secure (vs.  insecure-disorganized) attachment is associated with protective reductions in  risk taking below a family income to needs ratio of 2.24, or about 220% poverty  level. Findings support a diathesis-stress model in which children with secure  attachment histories are less deleteriously impacted by early socioeconomic  adversity than their insecure-disorganized peers.

This study explored age-related periods of change in  social and role functioning. The longitudinal study included youth (aged 12-23,  mean follow-up years = 1.19) at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis  (converters [CHR-C], n = 83; nonconverters [CHR-NC], n = 275) and a healthy  control group (n = 164). Mixed-model analyses were performed to determine  age-related differences in social and role functioning. We limited our analyses  to functioning before psychosis conversion; thus, data of CHR-C participants  gathered after psychosis onset were excluded. In controls, social and role  functioning improved over time. From at least age 12, functioning in CHR was  poorer than in controls, and this lag persisted over time. Between ages 15 and  18, social functioning in CHR-C stagnated and diverged from that of CHR-NC, who  continued to improve (p = .001). Subsequently, CHR-C lagged behind in  improvement between ages 21 and 23, further distinguishing them from CHR-NC (p <  .001). A similar period of stagnation was apparent for role functioning, but to  a lesser extent (p = .007). The results remained consistent when we accounted  for the time to conversion. Our findings suggest that CHR-C start lagging behind  CHR-NC in social and role functioning in adolescence, followed by a period of  further stagnation in adulthood.

Maternal mind-mindedness and toddler behavior problems: The moderating role of  maternal trauma and posttraumatic stress.	Easterbrooks MA(1), Crossman MK(1), Caruso A(1), Raskin M(1), Miranda-Julian  C(1).	Author information: (1)Tufts University.	Maternal mind-mindedness (MM) reflects a caregiver's tendency to view a child as  an individual with an independent mind. Research has linked higher MM with more  favorable parenting and child adaptation. The aim of this study was to examine  whether MM was associated with toddlers' behavior problems and competence, and  the moderating role of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a  sample (N = 212) of adolescent mothers and their toddlers. MM was coded from  maternal utterances during free play; mothers completed the University of  California at Los Angeles Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction  Index and reported on children's behavior problems and competence using the  Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment. The majority of mothers  (84%) experienced trauma; 45% of these mothers met criteria for partial or full  PTSD. Trauma was related to greater behavior problems, and PTSD moderated  MM-child functioning relations. When mothers experienced full PTSD, there was no  relation between MM and behavior problems. With child competence, when compared  to children of mothers with no trauma exposure, children of mothers experiencing  partial PTSD symptoms were more likely to have delays in competence when mothers  made more MM comments. Results are discussed in light of how MM, in the context  of trauma and PTSD, may affect parenting.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417000360 PMID: 28414000 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Attachment security mediates the longitudinal association between child-parent  psychotherapy and peer relations for toddlers of depressed mothers.	Guild DJ(1), Toth SL(1), Handley ED(1), Rogosch FA(1), Cicchetti D(1).	Author information: (1)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	Numerous investigations have demonstrated that child-parent psychotherapy (CPP)  promotes secure attachment between mothers and offspring. However, the role of  postintervention attachment security as it relates to long-term child outcomes  has never been evaluated. The present study therefore examined postintervention  attachment status as a mediator of the association between CPP for depressed  mothers and their offspring and subsequent peer relations among offspring.  Depressed mothers and their toddlers were randomized to receive CPP (n = 45) or  to a control group (n = 55). A prior investigation with this sample indicated  that offspring who received CPP attained significantly higher rates of secure  attachment postintervention, whereas insecure attachment continued to  predominate for offspring in the control group. The present study examined  follow-up data of teachers' reports on participants' competence with classroom  peers when they were approximately 9 years old. Findings indicated that children  who received CPP were more likely to evidence secure attachments at  postintervention, which in turn was associated with more positive peer  relationships at age 9.

Signs of reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement  disorder at age 12 years: Effects of institutional care history and high-quality  foster care.	Humphreys KL(1), Nelson CA(2), Fox NA(3), Zeanah CH(1).	Author information: (1)Tulane University. (2)Harvard Medical School. (3)University of Maryland,College Park.	Two disorders of attachment have been consistently identified in some young  children following severe deprivation in early life: reactive attachment  disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder. However, less is known  about whether signs of these disorders persist into adolescence. We examined  signs of reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement  disorder at age 12 years in 111 children who were abandoned at or shortly after  birth and subsequently randomized to care as usual or to high-quality foster  care, as well as in 50 comparison children who were never institutionalized.  Consistent with expectations, those who experienced institutional care in early  life had more signs of reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social  engagement disorder at age 12 years than children never institutionalized. In  addition, using a conservative intent-to-treat approach, those children  randomized to foster care had significantly fewer signs of reactive attachment  disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder than those randomized to  care as usual. Analyses within the ever institutionalized group revealed no  effects of the age of placement into foster care, but number of caregiving  disruptions experienced and the percentage of the child's life spent in  institutional care were significant predictors of signs of attachment disorders  assessed in early adolescence. These findings indicate that adverse caregiving  environments in early life have enduring effects on signs of attachment  disorders, and provide further evidence that high-quality caregiving  interventions are associated with reductions in both reactive attachment  disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder.

Using a sample of 41 infants and toddlers (21 interventions, 20 controls) who  were neglected or at serious risk for neglect, this randomized clinical trial  examined the efficacy of a parent-child attachment-based video-feedback  intervention on parental sensitivity, parental stress, and child  mental/psychomotor development. Results showed that following the 8-week  intervention, scores for maternal sensitivity and child mental and psychomotor  development were higher in the intervention group than in the control group. The  intervention appears to have no effect on self-reports of stress. All parents  report lower levels of stress postintervention; however, when defensive  responding is not considered (i.e., extremely low score of parental stress),  parents in the control group report somewhat lower scores, raising questions as  to the significance of this finding. Considering the small nature of our sample,  replication of the present results is needed. Nevertheless, the present findings  contribute to the burgeoning literature suggesting that the early attachment  relationship provides an important context that influences developmental outcome  in different spheres and raises questions as to how such intervention strategies  may or may not affect the subjective experience of parenting.

(2)Erasmus University Medical Center,Rotterdam.	This study examined whether the association between age and amygdala-medial  prefrontal cortex (mPFC) connectivity in typically developing 6- to 10-year-old  children is correlated with parental care. Resting-state functional magnetic  resonance imaging scans were acquired from 124 children of the Generation R  Study who at 4 years old had been observed interacting with their parents to  assess maternal and paternal sensitivity. Amygdala functional connectivity was  assessed using a general linear model with the amygdalae time series as  explanatory variables. Higher level analyses assessing Sensitivity × Age as well  as exploratory Sensitivity × Age × Gender interaction effects were performed  restricted to voxels in the mPFC. We found significant Sensitivity × Age  interaction effects on amygdala-mPFC connectivity. Age was related to stronger  amygdala-mPFC connectivity in children with a lower combined parental  sensitivity score (b = 0.11, p = .004, b = 0.06, p = .06, right and left  amygdala, respectively), but not in children with a higher parental sensitivity  score, (b = -0.07, p = .12, b = -0.06, p = .12, right and left amygdala,  respectively). A similar effect was found for maternal sensitivity, with  stronger amygdala-mPFC connectivity in children with less sensitive mothers.  Exploratory (parental, maternal, paternal) Sensitivity × Age × Gender  interaction analyses suggested that this effect was especially pronounced in  girls. Amygdala-mPFC resting-state functional connectivity has been shown to  increase from age 10.5 years onward, implying that the positive association  between age and amygdala-mPFC connectivity in 6- to 10-year-old children of less  sensitive parents represents accelerated development of the amygdala-mPFC  circuit.

Poehlmann-Tynan J(1), Burnson C(1), Runion H(1), Weymouth LA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin-Madison.	The present study examined young children's attachment behaviors during paternal  incarceration and reported on initial validity of a new measure used to rate  children's attachment-related behaviors and emotions during visits in a  corrections setting. Seventy-seven children, age 2 to 6 years, and their jailed  fathers and current caregivers participated in the home visit portion of the  study, whereas 28 of these children participated in the jail visit. The results  indicated that 27% of children witnessed the father's crime and 22% of children  witnessed the father's arrest, with most children who witnessed these events  exhibiting extreme distress; children who witnessed these events were more  likely to have insecure attachments to their caregivers. Consistent with  attachment theory and research, caregivers who exhibited more sensitivity and  responsivity during interactions with children and those who provided more  stimulating, responsive, learning-oriented home environments had children who  were more likely to have secure attachments (measured with the Attachment  Q-Sort). We also found preliminary evidence for the validity of our new measure,  the Jail Prison Observation Checklist, in that children's attachment-related  behaviors and emotions during the jail visit correlated with their attachment  security observed in the home. Our observations indicate that, in certain  contexts, noncontact visits with incarcerated parents can be stressful for  children and that children's caregivers may play a significant role during these  visits.

Hope Family Center. (3)University of Missouri. (4)University of Ottawa. (5)Mount Holyoke College. (6)Edgewood College.	This paper reports the first large-sample investigation of the  maltreatment-related correlates of low-income adolescents' narratives about  their childhood experiences with primary caregivers, as assessed with a modified  version of the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and based on official reports of  abuse and neglect (maltreated n = 214, nonmaltreated n = 140; M age = 16.7  years). Drawing on factor-analytic and taxometric evidence indicating that AAI  narratives vary along two state of mind (i.e., dismissing and preoccupied) and  two inferred childhood experience (i.e., maternal and paternal) dimensions, here  we demonstrate that the experience of maltreatment, particularly when chronic,  is associated with increased risk for dismissing and preoccupied states of mind  and more negative inferred childhood experiences. Although such  maltreatment-related associations were generally not specific to any of the four  AAI dimensions, the experience of physical and/or sexual abuse was uniquely  associated with preoccupied states of mind and negative inferred paternal  experiences even after controlling for the other AAI dimensions. More extensive  paternal perpetration of maltreatment also was uniquely related to more negative  inferred paternal experiences.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579417000025 PMID: 28401829 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

In this investigation the factor structure of the Adult Attachment Interview was  studied in a partially at-risk sample of 120 young adults. More specifically, 60  participants had engaged in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI; 53 females, M age =  20.38 years), and 60 were non-self-injuring controls matched by age and sex.  Theoretically anticipated differential associations between preoccupied (but not  dismissing) states of mind and NSSI were then examined. Exploratory factor  analyses identified evidence for two weakly correlated state of mind dimensions  (i.e., dismissing and preoccupied) consistently identified in factor analyses of  normative-risk samples. As hypothesized, results further showed that preoccupied  (but not dismissing) states of mind were associated with NSSI behavior. Findings  support existing arguments suggesting that the regulatory strategy adults adopt  when discussing attachment-related experiences with primary caregivers,  particularly passive, angry, or unresolved discourse patterns, is uniquely  correlated with NSSI.

Facompré CR(1), Bernard K(2), Waters TEA(1).	Author information: (1)New York University-Abu Dhabi. (2)Stony Brook University.	Disorganized attachment is associated with a host of negative developmental  outcomes, leading to a growing interest in preventative interventions targeting  the attachment relationship in infancy. The objective of this meta-analysis was  to assess the effectiveness of interventions that aimed to prevent or reduce  rates of disorganization among children at risk. We performed a literature  search using PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and ProQuest databases for studies published  between January 1989 and August 2016. All 16 studies (N = 1,360) included a  control condition and reported postintervention rates of organized and  disorganized attachments assessed by the Strange Situation Procedure. Results  showed that, overall, interventions were effective in increasing rates of  organized attachment compared to control conditions (d = 0.35, 95% CI  [0.10-0.61]). Moderator analyses demonstrated that interventions were more  effective (a) in more recently published studies than in older studies, (b) for  maltreated samples than nonmaltreated samples, and (c) as children increased in  age. These results have important implications for future development,  tailoring, and implementation of attachment-based intervention programs.

This study used four waves of data from a longitudinal study of 749 Mexican  origin youths to test a developmental cascades model linking contextual  adversity in the family and peer domains in late childhood to a sequence of  unfolding processes hypothesized to predict problem substance use and risky  sexual activity (greater number of sex partners) in late adolescence.  Externalizing and internalizing problems were tested as divergent pathways, with  youth-reported and mother-reported symptoms examined in separate models. Youth  gender, nativity, and cultural orientation were tested as moderators. Family  risk, peer social rejection, and their interaction were prospectively related to  externalizing symptoms and deviant peer involvement, although family risk showed  stronger effects on parent-reported externalizing and peer social rejection  showed stronger effects on youth-reported externalizing. Externalizing symptoms  and deviant peers were related, in turn, to risk taking in late adolescence,  including problem alcohol-substance use and number of sexual partners. Peer  social rejection predicted youth-reported internalizing symptoms, and  internalizing was related, in turn, to problem alcohol and substance use in late  adolescence. Tests of moderation showed some of these developmental cascades  were stronger for adolescents who were female, less oriented to mainstream  cultural values, and more oriented to Mexican American cultural values.

Little is known about the role of stress reactivity in the emergence of  psychopathology across early childhood. In this longitudinal study, we tested  the hypothesis that child cortisol reactivity at age 3 moderates associations  between early parenting and children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms  from age 3 to age 6. One hundred and sixty children were assessed at age 3, and  135 children were reassessed at age 6. At age 3, we exposed children to  stress-inducing laboratory tasks, during which we obtained four salivary  cortisol samples, and parental hostility was assessed using an observational  parent-child interaction task. At ages 3 and 6, child psychiatric symptoms were  assessed using a clinical interview with parents. The results indicated that the  combination of high child cortisol reactivity and high observed parental  hostility at age 3 was associated with greater concurrent externalizing symptoms  at age 3 and predicted increases in internalizing and externalizing symptoms  from age 3 to age 6. Findings highlight that increased stress reactivity, within  the context of hostile parenting, plays a role in the emergence of  psychopathology from preschool to school entry.

Phenotypic and genetic associations between reading and  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder dimensions in adolescence.	Plourde V(1), Boivin M(1), Brendgen M(1), Vitaro F(1), Dionne G(1).	Author information: (1)Research Unit on Children's Psychosocial Maladjustment,Québec.	Multiple studies have shown that reading abilities and  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, mainly inattention symptoms,  are phenotypically and genetically associated during childhood. However, few  studies have looked at these associations during adolescence to investigate  possible developmental changes. The aim of the study is to examine the genetic  and environmental etiology of the associations between inattention and  hyperactivity reported by parents, and reading accuracy, reading speed, and word  reading in a population-based twin sample (Quebec Newborn Twin Study).  Participants were between 14 and 15 years of age at the time of testing (N =  668-837). Phenotypic results showed that when nonverbal and verbal abilities  were controlled, inattention, but not hyperactivity/impulsivity, was a modest  and significant predictor of reading accuracy, reading speed, and word reading.  The associations between inattention and all reading abilities were partly  explained by genetic and unique environmental factors. However, the genetic  correlations were no longer significant after controlling for verbal abilities.  In midadolescence, inattention is the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  dimension associated with reading abilities, but they could also share genetic  factors with general verbal skills.

The role of parental marital discord in the etiology of externalizing problems  during childhood and adolescence.	Jarnecke AM(1), South SC(1), Elkins IJ(2), Krueger RF(2), Tully EC(3), Iacono  WG(2).	Author information: (1)Purdue University. (2)University of Minnesota Twin Cities. (3)Georgia State University.	Previous research has established that parental marital discord is associated  with higher levels of offspring externalizing behaviors, but it is unclear how  parental relationship functioning is associated with the genetic and  environmental variance on a factor of externalizing problems. Thus, the current  study assessed how parental marital discord moderates genetic and environmental  variance on offspring externalizing problems at two different ages: childhood  and late adolescence. That is, the magnitude of genetic and environmental  influences on offspring externalizing at ages 11 and 17 was examined as a  function of parental marital discord. Consistent with a diathesis-stress model  of psychopathology, it was hypothesized that with increasing marital discord,  genetic influences on externalizing would be more pronounced. Rather, results  indicated that for the 11-year-old sample, nonshared environmental influences  were greater when parental marital discord was low, and comparatively, shared  environmental influences contributed more to the variance in externalizing  problems when parental marital discord was high. No moderation was found for the  17-year-old cohort. In contrast to studies that do not find an effect of the  shared environment, these results provide evidence that the common rearing  environment has an impact on externalizing problems in preadolescent children.

Callous-unemotional behaviors in early childhood: Genetic and environmental  contributions to stability and change.	Flom M(1), Saudino KJ(1).	Author information: (1)Boston University.	Callous-unemotional (CU) behaviors demonstrate meaningful individual differences  in early childhood, even in nonclinical samples with low mean levels of CU, but  the factors underlying this variation have not been examined. This study  investigated genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences  and to sources of continuity and change in CU in toddler twins (145 monozygotic,  169 dizygotic) assessed at ages 2 and 3 years. CU, as assessed by the Child  Behavior Checklist 1.5-5 (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000), was moderately stable  across age (r = .45, p < .0001). Longitudinal biometric analyses revealed  genetic and nonshared environmental influences on CU at both ages, with no  significant contribution from shared environmental factors. Stability from age 2  to 3 was due to genetic factors, whereas change was due to both genetic and  nonshared environmental influences. This genetic and nonshared environmental  change was substantial, suggesting malleability of CU in early childhood. Over  50% of the genetic influences and 100% of the nonshared environmental influences  on CU at age 3 were independent of those that operated at age 2. Implications of  novel sources of variance across age are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416001267 PMCID: PMC5472508 PMID: 27976598 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

This study explored how coping with war-related traumatic events in Sierra Leone  impacted mental health outcomes among 529 youth (aged 10-17 at baseline; 25%  female) using longitudinal data from three time points (Time 1 in 2002, Time 2  in 2004, and Time 3 in 2008). We examined two types of coping items (approach  and avoidance); used multiple regression models to test their relations with  long-term mental health outcomes (internalizing behaviors, externalizing  behaviors, adaptive/prosocial behaviors, and posttraumatic stress symptoms); and  used mediation analyses to test whether coping explained the relation between  previous war exposures (being raped, death of parent(s), or killing/injuring  someone during the war) and those outcomes. We found that avoidance coping items  were associated with lower internalizing and posttraumatic stress behaviors at  Time 3, and provided some evidence of mediating the relation between death of  parent(s) during the war and the two outcomes mentioned above. Approach coping  was associated with higher Time 3 adaptive/prosocial behaviors, whereas  avoidance coping was associated with lower Time 3 adaptive/prosocial behaviors.  Avoidance coping may be a protective factor against mental illness, whereas  approach coping may be a promotive factor for adaptive/prosocial behaviors in  war-affected societies. This study has important implications for designing and  implementing mental health interventions for youth in postconflict settings.

Building a translational science on children and youth affected by political  violence and armed conflict: A commentary.	Masten AS(1).	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development.	Articles in this timely Special Section represent an important milestone in the  developmental science on children and youth involved in political violence and  armed conflict. With millions of children worldwide affected by past and present  wars and conflicts, there is an urgent and growing need for research to inform  efforts to understand, prevent, and mitigate the possible harm of such violence  to individual children, families, communities, and societies, for present as  well as future generations. The four programs of research highlighted in this  Special Section illustrate key advances and challenges in contemporary  development research on young people growing up in the midst or aftermath of  political violence. These studies are longitudinal, methodologically  sophisticated, and grounded in socioecological systems models that align well  with current models of risk and resilience in developmental psychopathology.  These studies collectively mark a critically important shift to process-focused  research that holds great promise for translational applications. Nonetheless,  given the scope of the international crisis of children and youth affected by  political violence and its sequelae, there is an urgent global need for greater  mobilization of resources to support translational science and effective  evidence-based action.

The reader might get the impression that the four projects described in this  Special Section proceeded in a systematic and predictable way. Of course, those  of us engaged in each research project encountered pitfalls and challenges along  the way. A main goal of this Special Section is to provide pathways and  encouragement for those who may be interested in advancing high-quality research  on this topic. In this paper, we describe a set of practical and ethical  challenges that we encountered in conducting our longitudinal, process-oriented,  and translational research with conflict-affected youth, and we illustrate how  problems can be solved with the goal of maintaining the internal and external  validity of the research designs. We are hopeful that by describing the  challenges of our work, and how we overcame them, which are seldom treated in  this or any other literature on research on child development in high-risk  contexts, we can offer a realistic and encouraging picture of conducting  methodologically sound research in conflict-affected contexts.

Pupillary and affective responses to maternal feedback and the development of  borderline personality disorder symptoms.	Scott LN(1), Zalewski M(2), Beeney JE(1), Jones NP(1), Stepp SD(1).	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. (2)University of Oregon.	Etiological models propose that a biological vulnerability to emotional  reactivity plays an important role in the development of borderline personality  disorder (BPD). However, the physiological and phenomenological components of  emotional reactivity that predict the course of BPD symptoms in adolescence are  poorly understood. This prospective study examines pupillary and affective  responses to maternal feedback as predictors of BPD symptom development in  adolescent girls over 18 months. Fifty-seven 16-year-old girls completed a  laboratory task in which they heard recorded clips of their own mothers making  critical or praising statements about them, as well as neutral statements that  did not pertain to them. Changes in girls' pupil dilation and subjective affect  were assessed throughout the task. The results demonstrated that greater  pupillary response to maternal criticism predicted increases in BPD symptoms  over time. In addition, greater pupillary and positive affective responses to  maternal praise were associated with higher BPD symptoms at age 16 and faster  decreases in BPD symptoms over time, but only among girls who heard clips that  were rated by independent observers as less praising. The results suggest that  emotional reactivity can serve as either a risk or a protective factor depending  on context, with differential effects of reactivity to criticism versus praise.

Rutter M(1).	Author information: (1)Institute of Psychiatry,Psychology and Neuroscience.	Translational research focuses on innovation in healthcare settings, but this is  a two-way process that may have implications for either treatment or prevention.  Smoking and lung cancer and the fetal alcohol syndrome are used as examples.  Experimental medicine that budges basic and clinical science often constitutes a  key way forward. Areas of scientific progress and challenge are discussed in  relation to drug action, social cognition, cognitive neuroscience, molecular  genetics, gene-environment interaction, and epigenetics. Key concepts and  challenges in relation to stress include toxicity, allostatic load, the  hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and objectives versus subjective stress.  The reasons for the need to test causal inferences are discussed. Various kinds  of "natural experiments" are discussed in illustration using the assisted  conception design, the discordant monozygotic twin design, and the study of  universal exposure. Animal models are discussed in relation to enrichment and  deprivation effects and the effects of infant separation experiences, epigenetic  effects, and the biological embedding of experiences. Translational issues are  discussed in relation to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, epigenetics,  and inflammation. In conclusion, it is suggested that there are immediate  possibilities for experimental medicine but caution is needed with respect to  moving into translation too quickly.

Differential DNA methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in  adolescents exposed to significant early but not later childhood adversity.

(2)University of British Columbia Child and Family Research Institute.	Internationally adopted adolescents who are adopted as young children from  conditions of poverty and deprivation have poorer physical and mental health  outcomes than do adolescents conceived, born, and raised in the United States by  families similar to those who adopt internationally. Using a sample of Russian  and Eastern European adoptees to control for Caucasian race and US birth, and  nonadopted offspring of well-educated and well-resourced parents to control for  postadoption conditions, we hypothesized that the important differences in  environments, conception to adoption, might be reflected in epigenetic patterns  between groups, specifically in DNA methylation. Thus, we conducted an  epigenome-wide association study to compare DNA methylation profiles at  approximately 416,000 individual CpG loci from peripheral blood mononuclear  cells of 50 adopted youth and 33 nonadopted youth. Adopted youth averaged 22  months at adoption, and both groups averaged 15 years at testing; thus, roughly  80% of their lives were lived in similar circumstances. Although concurrent  physical health did not differ, cell-type composition predicted using the DNA  methylation data revealed a striking difference in the white blood cell-type  composition of the adopted and nonadopted youth. After correcting for cell type  and removing invariant probes, 30 CpG sites in 19 genes were more methylated in  the adopted group. We also used an exploratory functional analysis that revealed  that 223 gene ontology terms, clustered in neural and developmental categories,  were significantly enriched between groups.

Associations among child abuse, mental health, and epigenetic modifications in  the proopiomelanocortin gene (POMC): A study with children in Tanzania.	Hecker T(1), Radtke KM(2), Hermenau K(2), Papassotiropoulos A(3), Elbert T(2).	Author information: (1)University of Zurich. (2)University of Konstanz. (3)University of Basel.	Child abuse is associated with a number of emotional and behavioral problems.  Nevertheless, it has been argued that these adverse consequences may not hold  for societies in which many of the specific acts of abuse are culturally normed.  Epigenetic modifications in the genes of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis  may provide a potential mechanism translating abuse into altered gene  expression, which subsequently results in behavioral changes. Our investigation  took place in Tanzania, a society in which many forms of abuse are commonly  employed as disciplinary methods. We included 35 children with high exposure and  compared them to 25 children with low exposure. Extreme group comparisons  revealed that children with high exposure reported more mental health problems.  Child abuse was associated with differential methylation in the  proopiomelanocortin gene (POMC), measured both in saliva and in blood.  Hierarchical clustering based on the methylation of the POMC gene found two  distinct clusters. These corresponded with children's self-reported abuse, with  two-thirds of the children allocated into their respective group. Our results  emphasize the consequences of child abuse based on both molecular and behavioral  grounds, providing further evidence that acts of abuse affect children, even  when culturally acceptable. Furthermore, on a molecular level, our findings  strengthen the credibility of children's self-reports.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415001248 PMID: 26753719 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Witnessing substance use increases same-day antisocial behavior among at-risk  adolescents: Gene-environment interaction in a 30-day ecological momentary  assessment study.	Russell MA(1), Wang L(2), Odgers CL(2).	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University. (2)Duke University.	Many young adolescents are embedded in neighborhoods, schools, and homes where  alcohol and drugs are frequently used. However, little is known about (a) how  witnessing others' substance use affects adolescents in their daily lives and  (b) which adolescents will be most affected. The current study used ecological  momentary assessment with 151 young adolescents (ages 11-15) to examine the  daily association between witnessing substance use and antisocial behavior  across 38 consecutive days. Results from multilevel logistic regression models  indicated that adolescents were more likely to engage in antisocial behavior on  days when they witnessed others using substances, an association that held when  substance use was witnessed inside the home as well as outside the home (e.g.,  at school or in their neighborhoods). A significant Gene × Environment  interaction suggested that the same-day association between witnessing substance  use and antisocial behavior was significantly stronger among adolescents with,  versus without, the dopamine receptor D4 seven repeat (DRD4-7R) allele. The  implications of the findings for theory and research related to adolescent  antisocial behavior are discussed.

A multidomain cascade model of early childhood risk factors associated with  oppositional defiant disorder symptoms in a community sample of 6-year-olds.	Lavigne JV(1), Gouze KR(2), Hopkins J(3), Bryant FB(4).	Author information: (1)Northwestern University. (2)Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute. (3)Illinois Institute of Technology. (4)Loyola University Chicago.	The present study examined a cascade model of age 4 and 5 contextual, parent,  parenting, and child factors on symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)  at age 6 in a diverse community sample of 796 children. Contextual factors  include socioeconomic status, family stress, and conflict; parent factors  included parental depression; parenting factors included parental hostility,  support, and scaffolding skills; child factors included child effortful control  (EC), negative affect (NA), and sensory regulation. Direct effects of age 5  conflict, hostility, scaffolding, EC, and NA were found. Significant indirect,  cascading effects on age 6 ODD symptom levels were noted for age 4 socioeconomic  status via age 5 conflict and scaffolding skills; age 4 parental depression via  age 5 child NA; age 4 parental hostility and support via age 5 EC; age 4 support  via age 5 EC; and age 4 attachment via age 5 EC. Parenting contributed to EC,  and the age 5 EC effects on subsequent ODD symptom levels were distinct from age  5 parental contributions. Scaffolding and ODD symptoms may have a reciprocal  relationship. These results highlight the importance of using a multidomain  model to examine factors associated with ODD symptoms early in the child's  grammar school years.

Reinfjell T(1), Kårstad SB(1), Berg-Nielsen TS(1), Luby JL(2), Wichstrøm L(1).	Author information: (1)Norwegian University of Science and Technology. (2)Washington University School of Medicine.	Children's depressive symptoms in the transition from preschool to school are  rarely investigated. We therefore tested whether children's temperament  (effortful control and negative affect), social skills, child psychopathology,  environmental stressors (life events), parental accuracy of predicting their  child's emotion understanding (parental accuracy), parental emotional  availability, and parental depression predict changes in depressive symptoms  from preschool to first grade. Parents of a community sample of 995 4-year-olds  were interviewed using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment. The children  and parents were reassessed when the children started first grade (n = 795). The  results showed that DSM-5 defined depressive symptoms increased. Child  temperamental negative affect and parental depression predicted increased,  whereas social skills predicted decreased, depressive symptoms. However, such  social skills were only protective among children with low and medium effortful  control. Further, high parental accuracy proved protective among children with  low effortful control and high negative affect. Thus, interventions that treat  parental depression may be important for young children. Children with low  effortful control and high negative affect may especially benefit from having  parents who accurately perceive their emotional understanding. Efforts to  enhance social skills may prove particularly important for children with low or  medium effortful control.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415001170 PMID: 26645908 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Smoking in young adulthood among African Americans: Interconnected effects of  supportive parenting in early adolescence, proinflammatory epitype, and young  adult stress.	Beach SRH(1), Lei MK(1), Brody GH(1), Miller GE(2), Chen E(2), Mandara J(2),  Philibert RA(3).	Author information: (1)University of Georgia. (2)Northwestern University. (3)University of Iowa.	We examined two potentially interacting, connected pathways by which parental  supportiveness during early adolescence (ages 1-13) may come to be associated  with later African American young adult smoking. The first pathway is between  parental supportiveness and young adult stress (age 19), with stress, in turn,  predicting increased smoking at age 20. The second pathway is between supportive  parenting and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene methylation (i.e., TNFm), a  proinflammatory epitype, with low levels indicating greater inflammatory  potential and forecasting increased risk for smoking in response to young adult  stress. In a sample of 382 African American youth residing in rural Georgia,  followed from early adolescence (age 10-11) to young adulthood (age 20),  supportive parenting indirectly predicted smoking via associations with young  adult stress, IE = -0.071, 95% confidence interval [-0.132, -0.010]. In  addition, supportive parenting was associated with TNFm measured at age 20 (r =  .177, p = .001). Further, lower TNFm was associated with a significantly steeper  slope (b = 0.583, p = .003) of increased smoking in response to young adult  stress compared to those with higher TNFm (b = 0.155, p = .291), indicating an  indirect, amplifying role for supportive parenting via TNFm. The results suggest  that supportive parenting in early adolescence may play a role in understanding  the emergence of smoking in young adulthood.

(2)Yulius Mental Health Clinic.	This study assessed attachment representation and attachment-related autonomic  regulation in a sample of 38 maltreating and 35 nonmaltreating mothers. Mothers'  state of mind regarding attachment was measured using the Adult Attachment  Interview. They further watched an attachment-based comfort paradigm, during  which we measured skin conductance and vagal tone. More maltreating mothers  (42%) than nonmaltreating mothers (17%) had an unresolved/disoriented attachment  classification. Attachment representation was related to physiology during the  comfort paradigm: an unresolved state of mind and a nonautonomous classification  were associated with a decrease in skin conductance during the comfort paradigm,  specifically during the responsive caregiver scenario. However, physiology did  not differ between maltreating and nonmaltreating mothers. The decrease in skin  conductance of unresolved mothers during the comfort paradigm might be  indicative of a deactivating response, which is congruent with the dissociative  nature of the unresolved state of mind. The results point to the potential  utility of interventions focused on attachment representations for maltreating  mothers.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416001036 PMID: 27760578 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

(2)San Diego State University/University of California San Diego. (3)Medical University of South Carolina.	Adolescence is a period marked by increases in risk taking, sensation seeking,  and emotion dysregulation. Neurobiological models of adolescent development  propose that lagging development in brain regions associated with affect and  behavior control compared to regions associated with reward and emotion  processing may underlie these behavioral manifestations. Cross-sectional studies  have identified several functional brain networks that may contribute to risk  for substance use and psychopathology in adolescents. Determining brain  structure measures that prospectively predict substance use and psychopathology  could refine our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to these  problems, and lead to improved prevention efforts. Participants (N = 265) were  healthy substance-naïve adolescents (ages 12-14) who underwent magnetic  resonance imaging and then were followed annually for up to 13 years. Cortical  thickness and surface area measures for three prefrontal regions (dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and orbitofrontal cortex) and three  cortical regions from identified functional networks (anterior cingulate cortex,  insular cortex, and parietal cortex) were used to predict subsequent binge  drinking, externalizing symptoms, and internalizing symptoms. Thinner  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal cortex in early adolescence  predicted more binge drinking and externalizing symptoms, respectively, in late  adolescence (ps < .05). Having a family history of alcohol use disorder  predicted more subsequent binge drinking and externalizing symptoms. Thinner  parietal cortex, but not family history, predicted more subsequent internalizing  symptoms (p < .05). This study emphasizes the temporal association between  maturation of the salience, inhibition, and executive control networks in early  adolescence and late adolescent behavior outcomes. Our findings indicate that  developmental variations in these brain regions predate behavioral outcomes of  substance use and psychopathology, and may therefore serve as prospective  biomarkers of vulnerability.

Author information: (1)University of Missouri.	Epidemiologic studies demonstrating high rates of co-occurrence among  psychiatric disorders at the population level have contributed to large  literatures focused on identifying the causal mechanisms underlying the patterns  of co-occurrence among these disorders. Such efforts have long represented a  core focus of developmental psychopathologists and have more recently been  supported by the Research Domain Criteria initiative developed by the NIMH,  which provides a further framework for how the hypothesized mechanisms can be  studied at different levels of analysis. The present overview focuses on  molecular genetic approaches that are being used currently to study the etiology  of psychiatric disorders, and how these approaches have been applied in efforts  to understand the biological mechanisms that give rise to comorbid conditions.  The present report begins with a review of molecular genetic approaches used to  identify individual variants that confer risk for multiple disorders and the  intervening biological mechanisms that contribute to their comorbidity. This is  followed by a review of molecular genetic approaches that use genetic data in  aggregate to examine these questions, and concludes with a discussion of how  developmental psychopathologists are uniquely positioned to apply these methods  in a way that will further our understanding of the causal factors that  contribute to the development of comorbid conditions.

Willner CJ(1), Gatzke-Kopp LM(1), Bray BC(1).	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University.	High rates of comorbidity are observed between internalizing and externalizing  problems, yet the developmental dynamics of comorbid symptom presentations are  not yet well understood. This study explored the developmental course of latent  profiles of internalizing and externalizing symptoms across kindergarten, first  grade, and second grade. The sample consisted of 336 children from an urban,  low-income community, selected based on relatively high (61%) or low (39%)  aggressive/oppositional behavior problems at school entry (64% male; 70% African  American, 20% Hispanic). Teachers reported on children's symptoms in each year.  An exploratory latent profile analysis of children's scores on  aggression/oppositionality, hyperactivity/inattention, anxiety, and social  withdrawal symptom factors revealed four latent symptom profiles: comorbid (48%  of the sample in each year), internalizing (19%-23%), externalizing (21%-22%),  and well-adjusted (7%-11%). The developmental course of these symptom profiles  was examined using a latent transition analysis, which revealed remarkably high  continuity in the comorbid symptom profile (89% from one year to the next) and  moderately high continuity in both the internalizing and externalizing profiles  (80% and 71%, respectively). Internalizing children had a 20% probability of  remitting to the well-adjusted profile by the following year, whereas  externalizing children had a 25% probability of transitioning to the comorbid  profile. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a common  vulnerability factor contributes to developmentally stable  internalizing-externalizing comorbidity, while also suggesting that some  children with externalizing symptoms are at risk for subsequently accumulating  internalizing symptoms.

(3)University of Washington. (4)Katholike University Leuven. (5)Ohio State University.	It is well known that comorbidity is the rule, not the exception, for  categorically defined psychiatric disorders, and this is also the case for  internalizing disorders of depression and anxiety. This theoretical review paper  addresses the ubiquity of comorbidity among internalizing disorders. Our central  thesis is that progress in understanding this co-occurrence can be made by  employing latent dimensional structural models that organize psychopathology as  well as vulnerabilities and risk mechanisms and by connecting the multiple  levels of risk and psychopathology outcomes together. Different vulnerabilities  and risk mechanisms are hypothesized to predict different levels of the  structural model of psychopathology. We review the present state of knowledge  based on concurrent and developmental sequential comorbidity patterns among  common discrete psychiatric disorders in youth, and then we advocate for the use  of more recent bifactor dimensional models of psychopathology (e.g., p factor;  Caspi et al., 2014) that can help to explain the co-occurrence among  internalizing symptoms. In support of this relatively novel conceptual  perspective, we review six exemplar vulnerabilities and risk mechanisms,  including executive function, information processing biases, cognitive  vulnerabilities, positive and negative affectivity aspects of temperament, and  autonomic dysregulation, along with the developmental occurrence of stressors in  different domains, to show how these vulnerabilities can predict the general  latent psychopathology factor, a unique latent internalizing dimension, as well  as specific symptom syndrome manifestations.

Development of self-inflicted injury: Comorbidities and continuities with  borderline and antisocial personality traits.	Crowell SE(1), Kaufman EA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Utah.	Self-inflicted injury (SII) is a continuum of intentionally self-destructive  behaviors, including nonsuicidal self-injuries, suicide attempts, and death by  suicide. These behaviors are among the most pressing yet perplexing clinical  problems, affecting males and females of every race, ethnicity, culture,  socioeconomic status, and nearly every age. The complexity of these behaviors  has spurred an immense literature documenting risk and vulnerability factors  ranging from individual to societal levels of analysis. However, there have been  relatively few attempts to articulate a life span developmental model that  integrates ontogenenic processes across these diverse systems. The objective of  this review is to outline such a model with a focus on how observed patterns of  comorbidity and continuity can inform developmental theories, early prevention  efforts, and intervention across traditional diagnostic boundaries.  Specifically, when SII is viewed through the developmental psychopathology lens,  it becomes apparent that early temperamental risk factors are associated with  risk for SII and a range of highly comorbid conditions, such as borderline and  antisocial personality disorders. Prevention efforts focused on early-emerging  biological and temperamental contributors to psychopathology have great  potential to reduce risk for many presumably distinct clinical problems. Such  work requires identification of early biological vulnerabilities, behaviorally  conditioned social mechanisms, as well as societal inequities that contribute to  self-injury and underlie intergenerational transmission of risk.

The bidirectional pathways between internalizing and externalizing problems and  academic performance from 6 to 18 years.	Van der Ende J(1), Verhulst FC(1), Tiemeier H(1).	Author information: (1)Erasmus University Medical Center.	Internalizing and externalizing problems are associated with poor academic  performance, both concurrently and longitudinally. Important questions are  whether problems precede academic performance or vice versa, whether both  internalizing and externalizing are associated with academic problems when  simultaneously tested, and whether associations and their direction depend on  the informant providing information. These questions were addressed in a sample  of 816 children who were assessed four times. The children were 6-10 years at  baseline and 14-18 years at the last assessment. Parent-reported internalizing  and externalizing problems and teacher-reported academic performance were tested  in cross-lagged models to examine bidirectional paths between these constructs.  These models were compared with cross-lagged models testing paths between  teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing problems and parent-reported  academic performance. Both final models revealed similar pathways from mostly  externalizing problems to academic performance. No paths emerged from  internalizing problems to academic performance. Moreover, paths from academic  performance to internalizing and externalizing problems were only found when  teachers reported on children's problems and not for parent-reported problems.  Additional model tests revealed that paths were observed in both childhood and  adolescence. Externalizing problems place children at increased risk of poor  academic performance and should therefore be the target for interventions.

Understanding the interplay of individual and social-developmental factors in  the progression of substance use and mental health from childhood to adulthood.	Jones TM(1), Hill KG(1), Epstein M(1), Lee JO(2), Hawkins JD(1), Catalano RF(1).	Author information: (1)University of Washington. (2)University of Southern California.	This study examines the interplay between individual and social-developmental  factors in the development of positive functioning, substance use problems, and  mental health problems. This interplay is nested within positive and negative  developmental cascades that span childhood, adolescence, the transition to  adulthood, and adulthood. Data are drawn from the Seattle Social Development  Project, a gender-balanced, ethnically diverse community sample of 808  participants interviewed 12 times from ages 10 to 33. Path modeling showed  short- and long-term cascading effects of positive social environments, family  history of depression, and substance-using social environments throughout  development. Positive family social environments set a template for future  partner social environment interaction and had positive influences on proximal  individual functioning, both in the next developmental period and long term.  Family history of depression adversely affected mental health functioning  throughout adulthood. Family substance use began a cascade of substance-specific  social environments across development, which was the pathway through which  increasing severity of substance use problems flowed. The model also indicated  that adolescent, but not adult, individual functioning influenced selection into  positive social environments, and significant cross-domain effects were found in  which substance-using social environments affected subsequent mental health.

Predicting sexual coercion in early adulthood: The transaction among  maltreatment, gang affiliation, and adolescent socialization of coercive  relationship norms.	Ha T(1), Kim H(1), Christopher C(1), Caruthers A(2), Dishion TJ(1).	Author information: (1)Arizona State University. (2)University of Oregon,Eugene.	This study tested a transactional hypothesis predicting early adult sexual  coercion from family maltreatment, early adolescent gang affiliation, and  socialization of adolescent friendships that support coercive relationship  norms. The longitudinal study of a community sample of 998 11-year-olds was  intensively assessed in early and middle adolescence and followed to 23-24 years  of age. At age 16-17 youth were videotaped with a friend, and their interactions  were coded for coercive relationship talk. Structural equation modeling revealed  that maltreatment predicted gang affiliation during early adolescence. Both  maltreatment and gang affiliation strongly predicted adolescent sexual  promiscuity and coercive relationship norms with friends at age 16-17 years.  Adolescent sexual promiscuity, however, did not predict sexual coercion in early  adulthood. In contrast, higher levels of observed coercive relationship talk  with a friend predicted sexual coercion in early adulthood for both males and  females. These findings suggest that peers have a socialization function in the  development of norms prognostic of sexual coercion, and the need to consider  peers in the promotion of healthy relationships.

(2)Wichita State University.	This report uses 6-year outcomes of the Oregon Divorce Study to examine the  processes by which parenting practices affect deviant peer association during  two developmental stages: early to middle childhood and late childhood to early  adolescence. The participants were 238 newly divorced mothers and their 5- to  8-year-old sons who were randomly assigned to Parent Management Training-Oregon  Model (PMTO®) or to a no-treatment control group. Parenting practices, child  delinquent behavior, and deviant peer association were repeatedly assessed from  baseline to 6 years after baseline using multiple methods and informants. PMTO  had a beneficial effect on parenting practices relative to the control group.  Two stage models linking changes in parenting generated by PMTO to children's  growth in deviant peer association were supported. During the early to middle  childhood stage, the relationship of improved parenting practices on deviant  peer association was moderated by family socioeconomic status (SES); effective  parenting was particularly important in mitigating deviant peer association for  lower SES families whose children experience higher densities of deviant peers  in schools and neighborhoods. During late childhood and early adolescence, the  relationship of improved parenting to youths' growth in deviant peer association  was mediated by reductions in the growth of delinquency during childhood; higher  levels of early delinquency are likely to promote deviant peer association  through processes of selective affiliation and reciprocal deviancy training. The  results are discussed in terms of multilevel developmental progressions of  diminished parenting, child involvement in deviancy producing processes in peer  groups, and increased variety and severity of antisocial behavior, all  exacerbated by ecological risks associated with low family SES.

Deviance proneness models propose a multilevel interplay in which transactions  among genetic, individual, and family risk factors place children at increased  risk for substance use. We examined bidirectional transactions between  impulsivity and family conflict from middle childhood to adolescence and their  contributions to substance use in adolescence and emerging adulthood (n = 380).  Moreover, we examined children's, mothers', and fathers' polygenic risk scores  for behavioral undercontrol, and mothers' and fathers' interparental conflict  and substance disorder diagnoses as predictors of these transactions. The  results support a developmental cascade model in which children's polygenic risk  scores predicted greater impulsivity in middle childhood. Impulsivity in middle  childhood predicted greater family conflict in late childhood, which in turn  predicted greater impulsivity in late adolescence. Adolescent impulsivity  subsequently predicted greater substance use in emerging adulthood. Results are  discussed with respect to evocative genotype-environment correlations within  developmental cascades and applications to prevention efforts.

Sexually dimorphic and interactive effects of prenatal maternal cortisol and  psychological distress on infant cortisol reactivity.	Giesbrecht GF(1), Letourneau N(1), Campbell TS(1); Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes  and Nutrition Study Team.	Author information: (1)University of Calgary.	In utero exposure to maternal psychological distress is a risk factor for  developmental psychopathology, and these effects are believed to partially occur  via dysregulation of the maternal and fetal hypothalamus-adrenal-pituitary axes.  Nevertheless, only a few human studies have directly assessed the effects of  prenatal cortisol exposure on infant cortisol reactivity, and none have  investigated sex differences or potential interactions between prenatal cortisol  and psychological distress. Here we report on a prospective longitudinal  investigation (N = 236) of in utero exposure to maternal cortisol and distress  in a relatively high socioeconomic status and low-risk population to determine  whether these exposures interact in their effects on infant (M age = 3.0 months,  range = 2.3-5.0 months, 51.9% male) cortisol reactivity and whether there are  sex differences in these effects. Results revealed both sexually dimorphic and  interactive effects of prenatal cortisol and distress, even after controlling  for postnatal distress. In general, blunted reactivity in females was associated  with exposure to high maternal distress and flattened patterns of diurnal  maternal cortisol, whereas blunted reactivity in males was associated with  exposure to steeper morning increases and daytime decreases in maternal  cortisol. The findings suggest that sex differences in the effects of prenatal  cortisol and distress on infant cortisol reactivity are a plausible mechanism by  which maternal experiences during pregnancy contribute to sex differences in the  development of psychopathology.

Differential associations of threat and deprivation with emotion regulation and  cognitive control in adolescence.	Lambert HK(1), King KM(1), Monahan KC(2), McLaughlin KA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Washington. (2)University of Pittsburgh.	Research on childhood adversity has traditionally focused on single types of  adversity, which is limited because of high co-occurrence, or on the total  number of adverse experiences, which assumes that diverse experiences influence  development similarly. Identifying dimensions of environmental experience that  are common to multiple types of adversity may be a more effective strategy. We  examined the unique associations of two such dimensions (threat and cognitive  deprivation) with automatic emotion regulation and cognitive control using a  multivariate approach that simultaneously examined both dimensions of adversity.  Data were drawn from a community sample of adolescents (N = 287) with  variability in exposure to violence, an indicator of threat, and poverty, which  is associated with cognitive deprivation. Adolescents completed tasks measuring  automatic emotion regulation and cognitive control in neutral and emotional  contexts. Violence was associated with automatic emotion regulation deficits,  but not cognitive control; poverty was associated with poor cognitive control,  but not automatic emotion regulation. Both violence and poverty predicted poor  inhibition in an emotional context. Utilizing an approach focused on either  single types of adversity or cumulative risk obscured specificity in the  associations of violence and poverty with emotional and cognitive outcomes.  These findings suggest that different dimensions of childhood adversity have  distinct influences on development and highlight the utility of a differentiated  multivariate approach.

Studies have demonstrated that the effects of two well-known predictors of  adolescent substance use, family monitoring and antisocial peers, are not static  but change over the course of adolescence. Moreover, these effects may differ  for different groups of youth. The current study uses time-varying effect  modeling to examine the changes in the association between family monitoring and  antisocial peers and marijuana use from ages 11 to 19, and to compare these  associations by gender and levels of behavioral disinhibition. Data are drawn  from the Raising Healthy Children study, a longitudinal panel of 1,040 youth.  The strength of association between family monitoring and antisocial peers and  marijuana use was mostly steady over adolescence, and was greater for girls than  for boys. Differences in the strength of the association were also evident by  levels of behavioral disinhibition: youth with lower levels of disinhibition  were more susceptible to the influence of parents and peers. Stronger influence  of family monitoring on girls and less disinhibited youth was most evident in  middle adolescence, whereas the stronger effect of antisocial peers was  significant during middle and late adolescence. Implications for the timing and  targeting of marijuana preventive interventions are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579416000559 PMCID: PMC5237614 PMID: 27417425 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

A cascade from disregard for rules of conduct at preschool age to parental power  assertion at early school age to antisocial behavior in early preadolescence:  Interplay with the child's skin conductance level.	Kochanska G(1), Brock RL(2), Boldt LJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Iowa. (2)University of Nebraska-Lincoln.	Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2017 Aug;29(3):1131.	Young children's disregard for conduct rules (failing to experience discomfort  following transgressions and violating adults' prohibitions) often foreshadows  future antisocial trajectories, perhaps in part because it elicits more  power-assertive parental discipline, which in turn promotes children's  antisocial behavior. This process may be particularly likely for children with  low skin conductance level (SCL). In 102 two-parent community families, we  tested a model in which children's SCL, assessed at 8 years, was posed as a  moderator of the cascade from children's disregard for conduct rules at 4.5  years to parents' power assertion at 5.5 and 6.5 years to antisocial behavior at  10 and 12 years. Children's disregard for conduct rules was observed in scripted  laboratory paradigms, parents' power assertion was observed in discipline  contexts, and children's antisocial behavior was rated by parents. Conditional  process analyses revealed that the developmental cascade from early disregard  for rules to future parental power assertion to antisocial outcomes occurred  only for the children with low SCL (below median), but not their high-SCL (above  median) peers. By elucidating the specific interplay among children's disregard  for rules, the parenting they receive, and their psychophysiology, this study  represents a developmentally informed, multilevel approach to early etiology of  antisocial behavior.

The current study examined a stage-based alcohol use trajectory model to test  for potential causal effects of earlier drinking milestones on later drinking  milestones in a combined sample of two cohorts of Australian monozygotic and  same-sex dizygotic twins (N = 7,398, age M = 30.46, SD = 2.61, 61% male, 56%  monozygotic twins). Ages of drinking, drunkenness, regular drinking, tolerance,  first nontolerance alcohol use disorder symptom, and alcohol use disorder  symptom onsets were assessed retrospectively. Ages of milestone attainment  (i.e., age-of-onset) and time between milestones (i.e., time-to-event) were  examined via frailty models within a multilevel discordant twin design. For  age-of-onset models, earlier ages of onset of antecedent drinking milestones  increased hazards for earlier ages of onset for more proximal subsequent  drinking milestones. For the time-to-event models, however, earlier ages of  onset for the "starting" milestone decreased risk for a shorter time period  between the starting and the "ending" milestone. Earlier age of onset of  intermediate milestones between starting and ending drinking milestones had the  opposite effect, increasing risk for a shorter time period between the starting  and ending milestones. These results are consistent with a causal effect of an  earlier age of drinking milestone onset on temporally proximal subsequent  drinking milestones.

Youth temperament, harsh parenting, and variation in the oxytocin receptor gene  forecast allostatic load during emerging adulthood.	Brody GH(1), Yu T(1), Barton AW(1), Miller GE(2), Chen E(2).	Author information: (1)University ofGeorgia. (2)Northwestern University.	An association has been found between receipt of harsh parenting in childhood  and adult health problems. However, this research has been principally  retrospective, has treated children as passive recipients of parental behavior,  and has overlooked individual differences in youth responsivity to harsh  parenting. In a 10-year multiple-wave prospective study of African American  families, we addressed these issues by focusing on the influence of  polymorphisms in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), variants of which appear to  buffer or amplify responses to environmental stress. The participants were 303  youths, with a mean age of 11.2 at the first assessment, and their parents, all  of whom were genotyped for variations in the rs53576 (A/G) polymorphism.  Teachers rated preadolescent (ages 11 to 13) emotionally intense and  distractible temperaments, and adolescents (ages 15 and 16) reported receipt of  harsh parenting. Allostatic load was assessed during young adulthood (ages 20  and 21). Difficult preadolescent temperament forecast elevated receipt of harsh  parenting in adolescence, and adolescents who experienced harsh parenting  evinced high allostatic load during young adulthood. However, these associations  emerged only among children and parents who carried A alleles of the OXTR  genotype. The results suggest the oxytocin system operates along with  temperament and parenting to forecast young adults' allostatic load.

Maternal sensitivity and adrenocortical functioning across infancy and  toddlerhood: Physiological adaptation to context?

(2)New York University. (3)RTI International. (4)Johns Hopkins University. (5)University of North Carolina at Greensboro.	Theory suggests that early experiences may calibrate the "threshold activity" of  the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in childhood. Particularly challenging  or particularly supportive environments are posited to manifest in heightened  physiological sensitivity to context. Using longitudinal data from the Family  Life Project (N = 1,292), we tested whether links between maternal sensitivity  and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity aligned with these predictions.  Specifically, we tested whether the magnitude of the within-person relation  between maternal sensitivity and children's cortisol levels, a proxy for  physiological sensitivity to context, was especially pronounced for children who  typically experienced particularly low or high levels of maternal sensitivity  over time. Our results were consistent with these hypotheses. Between children,  lower levels of mean maternal sensitivity (7-24 months) were associated with  higher mean cortisol levels across this period (measured as a basal sample  collected at each visit). However, the magnitude and direction of the  within-person relation was contingent on children's average levels of maternal  sensitivity over time. Increases in maternal sensitivity were associated with  contemporaneous cortisol decreases for children with typically low-sensitive  mothers, whereas sensitivity increases were associated with cortisol increases  for children with typically high-sensitive mothers. No within-child effects were  evident at moderate levels of maternal sensitivity.

Schleider JL(1), Weisz JR(1).	Author information: (1)Harvard University.	Despite major advances in the development of interventions for youth anxiety and  depression, approximately 30% of youths with anxiety do not respond to cognitive  behavioral treatment, and youth depression treatments yield modest symptom  decreases overall. Identifying networks of modifiable risk and maintenance  factors that contribute to both youth anxiety and depression (i.e.,  internalizing problems) may enhance and broaden treatment benefits by informing  the development of mechanism-targeted interventions. A particularly powerful  network is the rich array of family processes linked to internalizing problems  (e.g., parenting styles, parental mental health problems, and sibling  relationships). Here, we propose a new theoretical model, the triadic model of  family process, to organize theory and evidence around modifiable,  transdiagnostic family factors that may contribute to youth internalizing  problems. We describe the model's implications for intervention, and we propose  strategies for testing the model in future research. The model provides a  framework for studying associations among family processes, their relation to  youth internalizing problems, and family-based strategies for strengthening  prevention and treatment.

Child and environmental risk factors predicting readiness for learning in  children at high risk of dyslexia.	Dilnot J(1), Hamilton L(2), Maughan B(3), Snowling MJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Oxford. (2)York St. John University. (3)King's College London.	We investigate the role of distal, proximal, and child risk factors as  predictors of reading readiness and attention and behavior in children at risk  of dyslexia. The parents of a longitudinal sample of 251 preschool children,  including children at family risk of dyslexia and children with preschool  language difficulties, provided measures of socioeconomic status, home literacy  environment, family stresses, and child health via interviews and  questionnaires. Assessments of children's reading-related skills, behavior, and  attention were used to define their readiness for learning at school entry.  Children at family risk of dyslexia and children with preschool language  difficulties experienced more environmental adversities and health risks than  controls. The risks associated with family risk of dyslexia and with language  status were additive. Both home literacy environment and child health predicted  reading readiness while home literacy environment and family stresses predicted  attention and behavior. Family risk of dyslexia did not predict readiness to  learn once other risks were controlled and so seems likely to be best  conceptualized as representing gene-environment correlations. Pooling across  risks defined a cumulative risk index, which was a significant predictor of  reading readiness and, together with nonverbal ability, accounted for 31% of the  variance between children.

Trajectories of emotional-behavioral difficulty and academic competence: A  6-year, person-centered, prospective study of affluent suburban adolescents.	Ansary NS(1), McMahon TJ(2), Luthar SS(3).	Author information: (1)Rider University. (2)Yale University School of Medicine. (3)Arizona State University.	This longitudinal study of affluent suburban youth (N = 319) tracked from 6th to  12th grade is parsed into two segments examining prospective associations  concerning emotional-behavioral difficulties and academic achievement. In Part 1  of the investigation, markers of emotional-behavioral difficulty were used to  cluster participants during 6th grade. Generalized estimating equations were  then used to document between-cluster differences in academic competence from  6th to 12th grade. In Part 2 of the study, indicators of academic competence  were used to cluster the same students during 6th grade, and generalized  estimating equations were used to document between-cluster differences in  emotional-behavioral difficulty from 6th to 12th grade. The results from Part 1  indicated that patterns of emotional-behavioral difficulty during 6th grade were  concurrently associated with poorer grades and classroom adjustment with some  group differences in the rate of change in classroom adjustment over time. In  Part 2, patterns of academic competence during 6th grade were concurrently  associated with less emotional-behavioral difficulty and some group differences  in the rate of change in specific forms of emotional-behavioral difficulty over  time. These results suggest that the youth sampled appeared relatively well  adjusted and any emotional-behavioral-achievement difficulty that was evident at  the start of middle school was sustained through the end of high school.

Observed temperament from ages 6 to 36 months predicts parent- and  teacher-reported attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms in first  grade.	Willoughby MT(1), Gottfredson NC(2), Stifter CA(3); Family Life Project  Investigators.	Author information: (1)RTI International. (2)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. (3)Pennsylvania State University.	This study tested the prospective association between observational indicators  of temperament, which were obtained across multiple assessments when children  were 6-36 months of age, and parent and teacher reports of children's  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) behaviors, when children were in  first grade. Data were drawn from the Family Life Project and included 1,074  children for whom temperament and either parent- or teacher-reported ADHD  behavioral data were available. The results of variable-centered regression  models indicated that individual differences in temperament regulation, but not  temperamental reactivity, was uniquely predictive of parent- and  teacher-reported ADHD behaviors. Latent profile analyses were used to  characterize configurations of temperamental reactivity and regulation.  Person-centered regression models were subsequently estimated in which  temperamental profile membership replaced continuous indicators of temperamental  reactivity and regulation as predictors. The results of person-centered  regression models indicated that temperamental reactivity and regulation both  contributed (both alone and in combination) to the prediction of subsequent ADHD  behaviors. In general, the predictive associations from early temperament to  later ADHD were of modest magnitude (R 2 = .10-.17). Results are discussed with  respect to interest in the early identification of children who are at elevated  risk for later ADHD.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415001236 PMID: 26751219 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Emotion understanding, parent mental state language, and behavior problems in  internationally adopted children.	Tarullo AR(1), Youssef A(2), Frenn KA(2), Wiik K(2), Garvin MC(3), Gunnar MR(2).	Author information: (1)Boston University. (2)University of Minnesota. (3)Sonoma State University.	Internationally adopted postinstitutionalized (PI) children are at risk for  lower levels of emotion understanding. This study examined how postadoption  parenting influences emotion understanding and whether lower levels of emotion  understanding are associated with behavior problems. Emotion understanding and  parent mental state language were assessed in 3-year-old internationally adopted  PI children (N = 25), and comparison groups of children internationally adopted  from foster care (N = 25) and nonadopted (NA) children (N = 36). At 5.5-year  follow-up, PI children had lower levels of emotion understanding than NA  children, a group difference not explained by language. In the total sample,  parent mental state language at age 3 years predicted 5.5-year emotion  understanding after controlling for child language ability. The association of  parent mental state language and 5.5-year emotion understanding was moderated by  adoption status, such that parent mental state language predicted 5.5-year  emotion understanding for the internationally adopted children, but not for the  NA children. While postadoption experience does not erase negative effects of  early deprivation on emotion understanding, results suggest that parents can  promote emotion understanding development through mental state talk. At 5.5  years, PI children had more internalizing and externalizing problems than NA  children, and these behavioral problems related to lower levels of emotion  understanding.

Lower structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus is associated with a  history of child maltreatment and future psychological vulnerability to stress.	Hanson JL(1), Knodt AR(1), Brigidi BD(1), Hariri AR(1).	Author information: (1)Duke University.	The experience of child maltreatment is a significant risk factor for the  development of later internalizing disorders such as depression and anxiety.  This risk is particularly heightened after exposure to additional, more  contemporaneous stress. While behavioral evidence exists for such "stress  sensitization," little is known about the mechanisms mediating such  relationships, particularly within the brain. Here we report that the experience  of child maltreatment independent of recent life stress, gender, and age is  associated with reduced structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus, a major  white matter pathway between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, in  young adults. We further demonstrate that individuals with lower uncinate  fasciculus integrity at baseline who subsequently experience stressful life  events report higher levels of internalizing symptomatology at follow-up. Our  findings suggest a novel neurobiological mechanism linking child maltreatment  with later internalizing symptoms, specifically altered structural connectivity  within the brain's threat-detection and emotion-regulation circuitry.

Multigenerational links between mothers' experiences of autonomy in childhood  and preschoolers' respiratory sinus arrhythmia: Variations by maltreatment  status.	Noll LK(1), Clark CA(1), Skowron EA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Oregon.	Despite burgeoning evidence linking early exposure to child maltreatment (CM) to  deficits in self-regulation, the pathways to strong regulatory development in  these children are not well understood, and significant heterogeneity is  observed in their outcomes. Experiences of autonomy may play a key role in  transmitting self-regulatory capacity across generations and help explain  individual differences in maltreatment outcomes. In this study, we investigated  multigenerational associations between Generation 1 (G1)-Generation 2 (G2)  mothers' early experience of warmth and autonomy in relation to their own  mothers and their Generation 3 (G3) children's autonomic physiological  regulation in CM (n = 85) and non-CM (n = 128) families. We found that G2  mothers who recalled greater autonomy in their childhood relationship with their  G1 mothers had preschool-age G3 children with higher respiratory sinus  arrhythmia at baseline when alone while engaged in individual challenge tasks,  during social exchanges with their mother in joint challenge tasks, and during  the portions of the strange situation procedure when the mother was present.  Although no clear mediators of this association emerged, multigenerational links  among G1-G2 relations, maternal representations of her child, child behavior,  and child respiratory sinus arrhythmia differed by maltreatment status, thus  possibly representing important targets for future research and intervention.

This study advances understanding of predictors of child abuse and neglect at  multiple levels of influence. Mothers, fathers, and children (N = 1,418  families, M age of children = 8.29 years) were interviewed annually in three  waves in 13 cultural groups in nine countries (China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan,  Kenya, Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States). Multilevel models  were estimated to examine predictors of (a) within-family differences across the  three time points, (b) between-family within-culture differences, and (c)  between-cultural group differences in mothers' and fathers' reports of corporal  punishment and children's reports of their parents' neglect. These analyses  addressed to what extent mothers' and fathers' use of corporal punishment and  children's perceptions of their parents' neglect were predicted by parents'  belief in the necessity of using corporal punishment, parents' perception of the  normativeness of corporal punishment in their community, parents' progressive  parenting attitudes, parents' endorsement of aggression, parents' education,  children's externalizing problems, and children's internalizing problems at each  of the three levels. Individual-level predictors (especially child externalizing  behaviors) as well as cultural-level predictors (especially normativeness of  corporal punishment in the community) predicted corporal punishment and neglect.  Findings are framed in an international context that considers how abuse and  neglect are defined by the global community and how countries have attempted to  prevent abuse and neglect.

The emergence of co-occurring adolescent polysubstance use and depressive  symptoms: A latent growth modeling approach.	Felton JW(1), Kofler MJ(2), Lopez CM(3), Saunders BE(3), Kilpatrick DG(3).	Author information: (1)University of Maryland,College Park. (2)Florida State University. (3)Medical University of South Carolina.	This study tests competing models of the relation between depression and  polysubstance use over the course of adolescence. Participants included a  nationwide sample of adolescents (N = 3,604), ages 12 to 17 at study Wave 1,  assessed annually for 3 years. Models were tested using cohort-sequential latent  growth curve modeling to determine whether depressive symptoms at baseline  predicted concurrent and age-related changes in drug use, whether drug use at  baseline predicted concurrent and age-related changes in depressive symptoms,  and whether initial levels of depression predicted changes in substance use  significantly better than vice versa. The results suggest a transactional model  such that early polysubstance use promotes early depressive symptoms, which in  turn convey elevated risk for increasing polysubstance use over time, which in  turn conveys additional risk for future depressive symptoms, even after  accounting for gender, ethnicity, and household income. In contrast, early drug  use did not portend risk for future depressive symptoms. These findings suggest  a complicated pattern of interrelations over time and indicate that many current  models of co-occurring polysubstance use and depressive symptoms may not fully  account for these associations. Instead, the results suggest a developmental  cascade, in which symptoms of one disorder promote symptoms of the other across  intrapersonal domains.

Pubertal maturation and affective symptoms in adolescence and adulthood:  Evidence from a prospective birth cohort.	Gaysina D(1), Richards M(2), Kuh D(2), Hardy R(2).	Author information: (1)University of Sussex,Brighton. (2)University College London.	The higher prevalence of affective symptoms among women compared to men emerges  in adolescence, and it has been associated with pubertal maturation. However, it  remains unclear whether pubertal timing has long-term influences on affective  symptoms. Using data from the British 1946 birth cohort, we investigated whether  pubertal timing was associated with affective symptoms over the life course,  distinguishing those with symptoms in adolescence only, symptoms in adulthood  only, and symptoms in both adolescence and adulthood. In females, there was no  evidence that early pubertal maturation was a risk factor for affective  symptoms. However, those with particularly late menarche (≥15 years) showed a  lower risk of adult-onset affective symptoms (odds ratio = 0.54, 95% confidence  interval = 0.31, 0.95). This effect of late pubertal timing was not explained by  a range of sociobehavioral factors. In contrast, in males, late pubertal timing  was associated with increased risk of adolescent-onset affective symptoms that  tracked into adulthood (odds ratio = 2.10, 95% confidence interval = 1.44,  3.06). This effect was partly explained by low prepubertal body mass index.  Sex-specific effects of pubertal timing on the long-term risk of affective  symptoms might be due to different effects of gonadal hormonal on the central  nervous system, as well as different social experiences during puberty.

The effects of violence exposure on the development of impulse control and  future orientation across adolescence and early adulthood: Time-specific and  generalized effects in a sample of juvenile offenders.

(4)University of California,Irvine. (5)University of Arizona.	Impulse control and future orientation increase across adolescence, but little  is known about how contextual factors shape the development of these capacities.  The present study investigates how stress exposure, operationalized as exposure  to violence, alters the developmental pattern of impulse control and future  orientation across adolescence and early adulthood. In a sample of 1,354 serious  juvenile offenders, higher exposure to violence was associated with lower levels  of future orientation at age 15 and suppressed development of future orientation  from ages 15 to 25. Increases in witnessing violence or victimization were  linked to declines in impulse control 1 year later, but only during adolescence.  Thus, beyond previous experiences of exposure to violence, witnessing violence  and victimization during adolescence conveys unique risk for suppressed  development of self-regulation.

The association of temperament and maternal empathy with individual differences  in infants' neural responses to emotional body expressions.	Rajhans P(1), Missana M(1), Krol KM(1), Grossmann T(1).	Author information: (1)Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences,Leipzig.	We examined the role of infant temperament and maternal dispositional empathy in  the neural processing of happy and fearful emotional body expressions in  8-month-old infants by measuring event-related brain potentials. Our results  revealed that infants' tendency to approach novel objects and people was  positively correlated with the neural sensitivity (attention allocation) to  fearful expressions, while infant fearfulness was negatively correlated to the  neural sensitivity to fearful expressions. Maternal empathic concern was  associated with infants' neural discrimination between happy and fearful  expression, with infants of more empathetically concerned mothers showing  greater neural sensitivity (attention allocation) to fearful compared to happy  expressions. It is critical that our results also revealed that individual  differences in the sensitivity to emotional information are explained by an  interaction between infant temperament and maternal empathic concern.  Specifically, maternal empathy appears to impact infants' neural responses to  emotional body expressions, depending on infant fearfulness. These findings  support the notion that the way in which infants respond to emotional signals in  the environment is fundamentally linked to their temperament and maternal  empathic traits. This adds an early developmental neuroscience dimension to  existing accounts of social-emotional functioning, suggesting a complex and  integrative picture of why and how infants' emotional sensitivity varies.

Social and economic antecedents and consequences of adolescent aggressive  personality: Predictions from the interactionist model.	Conger RD(1), Martin MJ(1), Masarik AS(1), Widaman KF(1), Donnellan MB(2).	Author information: (1)University of California,Davis. (2)Texas A & M University.	The present study examined the development of a cohort of 279 early adolescents  (52% female) from 1990 to 2005. Guided by the interactionist model of  socioeconomic status and human development, we proposed that parent aggressive  personality, economic circumstances, interparental conflict, and parenting  characteristics would affect the development of adolescent aggressive  personality traits. In turn, we hypothesized that adolescent aggressiveness  would have a negative influence on adolescent functioning as an adult in terms  of economic success, personality development, and close relationships 11 years  later. Findings were generally supportive of the interactionist model  proposition that social and economic difficulties in the family of origin  intensify risk for adolescent aggressive personality (the social causation  hypothesis) and that this personality trait impairs successful transition to  adult roles (the social selection hypothesis) in a transactional process over  time and generations. These results underscore how early development leads to  child influences that appear to directly hamper the successful transition to  adult roles (statistical main effects) and also amplify the negative impact of  dysfunctional family systems on the transition to adulthood (statistical  interaction effects). The findings suggest several possible points of  intervention that might help to disrupt this negative developmental sequence of  events.

Temperament and peer problems from early to middle childhood: Gene-environment  correlations with negative emotionality and sociability.	Hasenfratz L(1), Benish-Weisman M(2), Steinberg T(3), Knafo-Noam A(1).	Author information: (1)Hebrew University of Jerusalem. (2)University of Haifa. (3)Tel Aviv University.	Based in a transactional framework in which children's own characteristics and  the social environment influence each other to produce individual differences in  social adjustment, we investigated relationships between children's peer  problems and their temperamental characteristics, using a longitudinal and  genetically informed study of 939 pairs of Israeli twins followed from early to  middle childhood (ages 3, 5, and 6.5). Peer problems were moderately stable  within children over time, such that children who appeared to have more peer  problems at age 3 tended to have also more peer problems at age 6.5. Children's  temperament accounted for 10%-22% of the variance in their peer problems  measured at the same age and for 2%-7% of the variance longitudinally. It is  important that genetic factors accounted for the association between temperament  and peer problems and were in line with a gene-environment correlation process,  providing support for the proposal that biologically predisposed  characteristics, particularly negative emotionality and sociability, have an  influence on children's early experiences of peer problems. The results  highlight the need for early and continuous interventions that are specifically  tailored to address the interpersonal difficulties of children with particular  temperamental profiles.

Adolescents', mothers', and fathers' gendered coping strategies during conflict:  Youth and parent influences on conflict resolution and psychopathology.

(3)Iowa State University. (4)St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. (5)University of California,Davis. (6)University of Minnesota.	We observed gendered coping strategies and conflict resolution outcomes used by  adolescents and parents during a conflict discussion task to evaluate  associations with current and later adolescent psychopathology. We studied 137  middle- to upper-middle-class, predominantly Caucasian families of adolescents  (aged 11-16 years, 65 males) who represented a range of psychological  functioning, including normative, subclinical, and clinical levels of problems.  Adolescent coping strategies played key roles both in the extent to which  parent-adolescent dyads resolved conflict and in the trajectory of  psychopathology symptom severity over a 2-year period. Gender-prototypic  adaptive coping strategies were observed in parents but not youth, (i.e., more  problem solving by fathers than mothers and more regulated emotion-focused  coping by mothers than fathers). Youth-mother dyads more often achieved full  resolution of conflict than youth-father dyads. There were generally not  bidirectional effects among youth and parents' coping across the discussion  except boys' initial use of angry/hostile coping predicted fathers'  angry/hostile coping. The child was more influential than the parent on conflict  resolution. This extended to exacerbation/alleviation of psychopathology over 2  years: higher conflict resolution mediated the association of adolescents' use  of problem-focused coping with decreases in symptom severity over time. Lower  conflict resolution mediated the association of adolescents' use of  angry/hostile emotion coping with increases in symptom severity over time.  Implications of findings are considered within a broadened context of the nature  of coping and conflict resolution in youth-parent interactions, as well as on  how these processes impact youth well-being and dysfunction over time.

The impact of children's internalizing and externalizing problems on parenting:  Transactional processes and reciprocal change over time.	Serbin LA(1), Kingdon D(1), Ruttle PL(1), Stack DM(1).	Author information: (1)Concordia University.	Most theoretical models of developmental psychopathology involve a  transactional, bidirectional relation between parenting and children's behavior  problems. The present study utilized a cross-lagged panel, multiple interval  design to model change in bidirectional relations between child and parent  behavior across successive developmental periods. Two major categories of child  behavior problems, internalizing and externalizing, and two aspects of  parenting, positive (use of support and structure) and harsh discipline (use of  physical punishment), were modeled across three time points spaced 3 years  apart. Two successive developmental intervals, from approximately age 7.5 to  10.5 and from 10.5 to 13.5, were included. Mother-child dyads (N = 138; 65 boys)  from a lower income longitudinal sample of families participated, with  standardized measures of mothers rating their own parenting behavior and  teachers reporting on child's behavior. Results revealed different types of  reciprocal relations between specific aspects of child and parent behavior, with  internalizing problems predicting an increase in positive parenting over time,  which subsequently led to a reduction in internalizing problems across the  successive 3-year interval. In contrast, externalizing predicted reduced levels  of positive parenting in a reciprocal sequence that extended across two  successive intervals and predicted increased levels of externalizing over time.  Implications for prevention and early intervention are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415000632 PMID: 26439057 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Views regarding children's influence on their environment and their own  development have undergone considerable changes over the years. Following Bell's  (1968) seminal paper, the notion of children's influence and the view of  socialization as a bidirectional process have gradually gained wide acceptance.  However, empirical research implementing this theoretical advancement has lagged  behind. This Special Section compiles a collection of new empirical works  addressing multiple forms of influential child processes, with special attention  to their consequences for children's and others' positive functioning, risk and  resilience. By addressing a wide variety of child influences, this Special  Section seeks to advance integration of influential child processes into myriad  future studies on development and psychopathology and to promote the translation  of such work into preventive interventions.

Childhood maltreatment is associated with altered frontolimbic neurobiological  activity during wakefulness in adulthood.	Insana SP(1), Banihashemi L(1), Herringa RJ(1), Kolko DJ(1), Germain A(1).	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.	Childhood maltreatment can disturb brain development and subsequently lead to  adverse socioemotional and mental health problems across the life span. The  long-term association between childhood maltreatment and resting-wake brain  activity during adulthood is unknown and was examined in the current study.  Forty-one medically stable and medication-free military veterans (M = 29.31 ±  6.01 years, 78% male) completed a battery of clinical assessments and had  [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography neuroimaging scans during  quiet wakefulness. After statistically adjusting for later-life trauma and  mental health problems, childhood maltreatment was negatively associated with  brain activity within a priori defined regions that included the left orbital  frontal cortex and left hippocampus. Childhood maltreatment was significantly  associated with increased and decreased brain activity within six additional  whole-brain clusters that included the frontal, parietal-temporal, cerebellar,  limbic, and midbrain regions. Childhood maltreatment is associated with altered  neural activity in adulthood within regions that are involved in executive  functioning and cognitive control, socioemotional processes, autonomic  functions, and sleep/wake regulation. This study provides support for taking a  life span developmental approach to understanding the effects of early-life  maltreatment on later-life neurobiology, socioemotional functioning, and mental  health.

Child personality facets and overreactive parenting as predictors of aggression  and rule-breaking trajectories from childhood to adolescence.

(4)Colgate University.	This study examined trajectories of aggression and rule breaking during the  transition from childhood to adolescence (ages 9-15), and determined whether  these trajectories were predicted by lower order personality facets,  overreactive parenting, and their interaction. At three time points separated by  2-year intervals, mothers and fathers reported on their children's aggression  and rule breaking (N = 290, M age = 8.8 years at Time 1). At Time 1, parents  reported on their children's personality traits and their own overreactivity.  Growth mixture modeling identified three aggression trajectories (low  decreasing, high decreasing, and high increasing) and two rule-breaking  trajectories (low and high). Lower optimism and compliance and higher energy  predicted trajectories for both aggression and rule breaking, whereas higher  expressiveness and irritability and lower orderliness and perseverance were  unique risk factors for increasing aggression into adolescence. Lower  concentration was a unique risk factor for increasing rule breaking. Parental  overreactivity predicted higher trajectories of aggression but not rule  breaking. Only two Trait × Overreactivity interactions were found. Our results  indicate that personality facets could differentiate children at risk for  different developmental trajectories of aggression and rule breaking.

Saxbe D(1), Del Piero LB(1), Immordino-Yang MH(1), Kaplan JT(1), Margolin G(1).	Author information: (1)University of Southern California.	Youth exposed to family aggression may become more aggressive themselves, but  the mechanisms of intergenerational transmission are understudied. In a  longitudinal study, we found that adolescents' reduced neural activation when  rating their parents' emotions, assessed via magnetic resonance imaging,  mediated the association between parents' past aggression and adolescents'  subsequent aggressive behavior toward parents. A subsample of 21 youth, drawn  from the larger study, underwent magnetic resonance imaging scanning proximate  to the second of two assessments of the family environment. At Time 1 (when  youth were on average 15.51 years old) we measured parents' aggressive marital  and parent-child conflict behaviors, and at Time 2 (≈2 years later), we measured  youth aggression directed toward parents. Youth from more aggressive families  showed relatively less activation to parent stimuli in brain areas associated  with salience and socioemotional processing, including the insula and limbic  structures. Activation patterns in these same areas were also associated with  youths' subsequent parent-directed aggression. The association between parents'  aggression and youths' subsequent parent-directed aggression was statistically  mediated by signal change coefficients in the insula, right amygdala, thalamus,  and putamen. These signal change coefficients were also positively associated  with scores on a mentalizing measure. Hypoarousal of the emotional brain to  family stimuli may support the intergenerational transmission of family  aggression.

This was a prospective longitudinal multisite study of the effects of prenatal  cocaine and/or opiate exposure on temperament in 4-month-olds of the Maternal  Lifestyle Study (N = 958: 366 cocaine exposed, 37 opiate exposed, 33 exposed to  both drugs, 522 matched comparison). The study evaluated positivity and  negativity during The Behavior Assessment of Infant Temperament (Garcia Coll et  al., 1988). Parents rated temperament (Infant Behavior Questionnaire; Rothbart,  1981). Cocaine-exposed infants showed less positivity overall, mainly during  activity and threshold items, more negativity during sociability items, and less  negativity during irritability and threshold items. Latent profile analysis  indicated individual temperament patterns were best described by three groups:  low/moderate overall reactivity, high social negative reactivity, and high  nonsocial negative reactivity. Infants with heavy cocaine exposure were more  likely in high social negative reactivity profile, were less negative during  threshold items, and required longer soothing intervention. Cocaine- and  opiate-exposed infants scored lower on Infant Behavior Questionnaire smiling and  laughter and duration of orienting scales. Opiate-exposed infants were rated as  less respondent to soothing. By including a multitask measure of temperament we  were able to show context-specific behavioral dysregulation in prenatally  cocaine-exposed infants. The findings indicate flatter temperament may be  specific to nonsocial contexts, whereas social interactions may be more  distressing for cocaine-exposed infants.

Eye tracking indices of attentional bias in children of depressed mothers:  Polygenic influences help to clarify previous mixed findings.

There is growing evidence that children of depressed  mothers exhibit attentional biases for sad faces. However, findings are mixed as  to whether this bias reflects preferential attention toward, versus attentional  avoidance of, sad faces, suggesting the presence of unmeasured moderators. To  address these mixed findings, we focused on the potential moderating role of  genes associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity.  Participants included children (8-14 years old) of mothers with (n = 81) and  without (n = 81) a history of depression. Eye movements were recorded while  children passively viewed arrays of angry, happy, sad, and neutral faces. DNA  was obtained from buccal cells. Children of depressed mothers exhibited more  sustained attention to sad faces than did children of nondepressed mothers.  However, it is important that this relation was moderated by children's  genotype. Specifically, children of depressed mothers who carried reactive  genotypes across the corticotropin-releasing hormone type 1 receptor (CHRH1) TAT  haplotype and FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) rs1360780 (but not the solute  carrier family C6 member 4 [SLC6A4] of the serotonin transporter linked  polymorphic region [5-HTTLPR]) exhibited less sustained attention to sad faces  and more sustained attention to happy faces. These findings highlight the role  played by specific genetic influences and suggest that previous mixed findings  may have been due to genetic heterogeneity across the samples.

Rothenberg WA(1), Hussong AM(1), Chassin L(2).	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. (2)Arizona State University.	In the current study, we examined continuity in conflict across generations and  explored potential mediators and moderators that could explain this continuity.  We followed 246 targets from adolescence to adulthood and examined family  conflict as reported by multiple reporters in targets' family of origin and  current families. Results showed that conflict in the current family was  strongly correlated with that of the family of origin in women but not in men.  Continuity in family conflict across generations was mediated by patterns of  elevated adolescent externalizing behavior in members of the second generation  (G2). In addition, analyses revealed an interaction between both G2 partners'  externalizing behavior such that if one partner in the G2 family demonstrated  high levels of externalizing behavior, elevated levels of family conflict  resulted. Potential explanations and implications of these findings are  considered.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579415000450 PMCID: PMC4904847 PMID: 26018605 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Cowell RA(1), Cicchetti D(2), Rogosch FA(3), Toth SL(3).	Author information: (1)St. Norbert College. (2)University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development. (3)University of Rochester Mt. Hope Family Center.	Childhood maltreatment represents a complex stressor, with the developmental  timing, duration, frequency, and type of maltreatment varying with each child  (Barnett, Manly, & Cicchetti, 1993; Cicchetti & Manly, 2001). Multiple brain  regions and neural circuits are disrupted by the experience of child  maltreatment (Cicchetti & Toth, in press; DeBellis et al., 2002; McCrory &  Viding, 2010; Teicher, Anderson, & Polcari, 2012). These neurobiological  compromises indicate the impairment of a number of important cognitive  functions, including working memory and inhibitory control. The present study  extends prior research by examining the effect of childhood maltreatment on  neurocognitive functioning based on developmental timing of maltreatment,  including onset, chronicity, and recency, in a sample of 3- to 9-year-old  nonmaltreated (n = 136) and maltreated children (n = 223). Maltreated children  performed more poorly on inhibitory control and working-memory tasks than did  nonmaltreated children. Group differences between maltreated children based on  the timing of maltreatment and the chronicity of maltreatment also were evident.  Specifically, children who were maltreated during infancy, and children with a  chronic history of maltreatment, exhibited significantly poorer inhibitory  control and working-memory performance than did children without a history of  maltreatment. The results suggest that maltreatment occurring during infancy, a  period of major brain organization, disrupts normative structure and function,  and these deficits are further instantiated by the prolonged stress of chronic  maltreatment during the early years of life.

We present new empirical data and meta-analytic evidence for the association of  childhood maltreatment with reduced hippocampal volume. In Study 1, we examined  the effects of maltreatment experiences reported during the Adult Attachment  Interview on hippocampal volume in female twin pairs. We found that reduced  hippocampal volume was related to childhood maltreatment. In addition,  individuals who reported having experienced maltreatment at older ages had  larger reductions in hippocampal volume compared to individuals who reported  maltreatment in early childhood. In Study 2, we present the results of a  meta-analysis of 49 studies (including 2,720 participants) examining hippocampal  volume in relation to experiences of child maltreatment, and test the moderating  role of the timing of the maltreatment, the severity of maltreatment, and the  time after exposure to maltreatment. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed  that experiences of childhood maltreatment are associated with a reduction in  hippocampal volume and that the effects of maltreatment are more pronounced when  the maltreatment occurs in middle childhood compared to early childhood or  adolescence.

Andersen SL(1).	Author information: (1)Harvard Medical School.	The relationship between developmental exposure to adversity and affective  disorders is reviewed. Adversity discussed herein includes physical and sexual  abuse, neglect, or loss of a caregiver in humans. While these stressors can  occur at any point during development, the unique temporal relationship to  specific depressive symptoms was the focus of discussion. Further influences of  stress exposure during sensitive periods can vary by gender and duration of  abuse as well. Data from animal studies are presented to provide greater  translational and causal understanding of how sensitive periods, different types  of psychosocial stressors, and sex interact to produce depressive-like  behaviors. Findings from maternal separation, isolation rearing, chronic  variable stress, and peer-peer rearing paradigms clarify interpretation about  how various depressive behaviors are influenced by age of exposure. Depressive  behaviors are broken down into the following categories: mood and affect,  anhedonia, energy, working memory, sleep-wake, appetite changes, suicide, and  general malaise. Cross-species evidence from humans, nonhuman primates, rats,  and mice within each of these categories is discussed. In conclusion, sensitive  periods for affective-related behaviors (anxiety, mood, and controllability)  occur earlier in life, while other aspects of depression are associated with  adversity later during adolescence.

Kornilov SA(1), Magnuson JS(1), Rakhlin N(2), Landi N(1), Grigorenko EL(2).	Author information: (1)University of Connecticut. (2)Yale University.	Lexical processing deficits in children with developmental language disorder  (DLD) have been postulated to arise as sequelae of their grammatical deficits  (either directly or via compensatory mechanisms) and vice versa. We examined  event-related potential indices of lexical processing in children with DLD (n =  23) and their typically developing peers (n = 16) using a picture-word matching  paradigm. We found that children with DLD showed markedly reduced N400  amplitudes in response both to auditorily presented words that had initial  phonological overlap with the name of the pictured object and to words that were  not semantically or phonologically related to the pictured object. Moreover,  this reduction was related to behavioral indices of phonological and lexical but  not grammatical development. We also found that children with DLD showed a  depressed phonological mapping negativity component in the early time window,  suggesting deficits in phonological processing or early lexical access. The  results are partially consistent with the overactivation account of lexical  processing deficits in DLD and point to the relative functional independence of  lexical/phonological and grammatical deficits in DLD, supporting a  multidimensional view of the disorder. The results also, although indirectly,  support the neuroplasticity account of DLD, according to which language  impairment affects brain development and shapes the specific patterns of brain  responses to language stimuli.

Author information: (1)University of Minnesota. (2)Boys' Town USA.	The human brain undergoes a remarkable transformation during fetal life and the  first postnatal years from a relatively undifferentiated but pluripotent organ  to a highly specified and organized one. The outcome of this developmental  maturation is highly dependent on a sequence of environmental exposures that can  have either positive or negative influences on the ultimate plasticity of the  adult brain. Many environmental exposures are beyond the control of the  individual, but nutrition is not. An ever-increasing amount of research  demonstrates not only that nutrition shapes the brain and affects its function  during development but also that several nutrients early in life have profound  and long-lasting effects on the brain. Nutrients have been shown to alter  opening and closing of critical and sensitive periods of particular brain  regions. This paper discusses the roles that various nutrients play in shaping  the developing brain, concentrating specifically on recently explicated  biological mechanisms by which particularly salient nutrients influence  childhood and adult neural plasticity.

Tuvblad C(1), Wang P(1), Bezdjian S(1), Raine A(2), Baker LA(1).	Author information: (1)University of Southern California. (2)University of Pennsylvania.	The genetic and environmental etiology of individual differences was examined in  initial level and change in psychopathic personality from ages 9 to 18 years. A  piecewise growth curve model, in which the first change score (G1) influenced  all ages (9-10, 11-13, 14-15, and 16-18 years) and the second change score (G2)  only influenced ages 14-15 and 16-18 years, fit the data better did than the  standard single slope model, suggesting a turning point from childhood to  adolescence. The results indicated that variations in levels and both change  scores were mainly due to genetic (A) and nonshared environmental (E) influences  (i.e., AE structure for G0, G1, and G2). No sex differences were found except on  the mean values of level and change scores. Based on caregiver ratings, about  81% of variance in G0, 89% of variance in G1, and 94% of variance in G2 were  explained by genetic factors, whereas for youth self-reports, these three  proportions were 94%, 71%, and 66%, respectively. The larger contribution of  genetic variance and covariance in caregiver ratings than in youth self-reports  may suggest that caregivers considered the changes in their children to be more  similar as compared to how the children viewed themselves.

Negative emotional reactivity as a marker of vulnerability in the development of  borderline personality disorder symptoms.	Stepp SD(1), Scott LN(1), Jones NP(1), Whalen DJ(2), Hipwell AE(1).	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. (2)Washington University School of Medicine.	Negative emotionality is a distinguishing feature of borderline personality  disorder (BPD). However, this person-level characteristic has not been examined  as a marker of vulnerability in the development of this disorder. The current  study utilized a multimethod approach to examine the interplay between negative  emotional reactivity and cumulative exposure to family adversity on the  development of BPD symptoms across 3 years (ages 16-18) in a diverse, at-risk  sample of adolescent girls (N = 113). A latent variable of negative emotional  reactivity was created from multiple assessments at age 16: self-report, emotion  ratings to stressors from ecological assessments across 1 week, and  observer-rated negative affectivity during a mother-daughter conflict discussion  task. Exposure to family adversity was measured cumulatively between ages 5 and  16 from annual assessments of family poverty, single parent household, and  difficult life circumstances. The results from latent growth curve models  demonstrated a significant interaction between negative emotional reactivity and  family adversity, such that exposure to adversity strengthened the association  between negative emotional reactivity and BPD symptoms. In addition, family  adversity predicted increasing BPD symptoms during late adolescence. These  findings highlight negative emotional reactivity as a marker of vulnerability  that ultimately increases risk for the development of BPD symptoms.

We examined how genotype-environment correlation processes differ as a function  of adolescent age. We tested whether adolescent age moderates genetic and  environmental influences on positivity and negativity in mother-adolescent and  father-adolescent relationships using parallel samples of twin parents from the  Twin and Offspring Study in Sweden and twin/sibling adolescents from the  Nonshared Environment in Adolescent Development Study. We inferred differences  in the role of passive and nonpassive genotype-environment correlation based on  biometric moderation findings. The findings indicated that nonpassive  gene-environment correlation played a stronger role for positivity in mother-  and father-adolescent relationships in families with older adolescents than in  families with younger adolescents, and that passive gene-environment correlation  played a stronger role for positivity in the mother-adolescent relationship in  families with younger adolescents than in families with older adolescents.  Implications of these findings for the timing and targeting of interventions on  family relationships are discussed.

Evidence that children exhibiting continuous conduct  problems high or low on callous-unemotional traits score on opposite directions  on physiological and behavioral measures of fear.	Fanti KA(1), Panayiotou G(1), Lazarou C(1), Michael R(1), Georgiou G(1).	Author information: (1)University of Cyprus.	The present study examines whether heterogeneous groups of children identified  based on their longitudinal scores on conduct problems (CP) and  callous-unemotional (CU) traits differ on physiological and behavioral measures  of fear. Specifically, it aims to test the hypothesis that children with  high/stable CP differentiated on CU traits score on opposite directions on a  fear-fearless continuum. Seventy-three participants (M age = 11.21; 45.2%  female) were selected from a sample of 1,200 children. Children and their  parents completed a battery of questionnaires assessing fearfulness, sensitivity  to punishment, and behavioral inhibition. Children also participated in an  experiment assessing their startle reactivity to fearful mental imagery, a  well-established index of defensive motivation. The pattern of results verifies  the hypothesis that fearlessness, assessed with physiological and behavioral  measures, is a core characteristic of children high on both CP and CU traits  (i.e., receiving the DSM-5 specifier of limited prosocial emotions). To the  contrary, children with high/stable CP and low CU traits demonstrated high  responsiveness to fear, high behavioral inhibition, and high sensitivity to  punishment. The study is in accord with the principle of equifinality, in that  different developmental mechanisms (i.e., extremes of high and low fear) may  have the same behavioral outcome manifested as phenotypic antisocial behavior.

Ehrlich KB(1), Miller GE(1), Rohleder N(2), Adam EK(1).	Author information: (1)Northwestern University. (2)Brandeis University.	Researchers have identified cross-sectional links between interpersonal stress  and inflammation. Little is known, however, about how these dynamics unfold over  time, what underlying immune pathways might exist, or whether moderators such as  race could alter the strength of the connection between interpersonal stress and  inflammatory processes. We examined whether adolescent girls whose relationship  trajectories were characterized by chronic stress would exhibit a  proinflammatory phenotype marked by systemic inflammation, heightened cytokine  responses to bacterial challenges, and resistance to the anti-inflammatory  properties of cortisol. Significant Stress × Race interactions revealed that  family stress trajectories predicted glucocorticoid sensitivity and peer stress  trajectories predicted cytokine production for White but not Asian girls.  Relationship stress trajectories were not associated with systemic inflammation,  however. These findings suggest that particular subgroups of adolescent girls  who face chronic and elevated stress in their close relationships may be at risk  for disruptions to the immune system.

Hollenstein T(1), Allen NB(2), Sheeber L(3).	Author information: (1)Queen's University. (2)University of Melbourne. (3)Oregon Research Institute.	Affective family processes are associated with the development of depression  during adolescence. However, empirical description of these processes is  generally based on examining affect at the individual or dyadic level. The  purpose of this study was to examine triadic patterns of affect during  parent-adolescent interactions in families with or without a depressed  adolescent. We used state space grid analysis to characterize the state of all  three actors simultaneously. Compared to healthy controls, triads with depressed  adolescents displayed a wider range of affect, demonstrated less predictability  of triadic affective sequences, spent more time in and returned more quickly to  discrepant affective states, and spent less time in and returned more slowly to  matched affective states, particularly while engaged in a problem-solving  interaction. Furthermore, we identified seven unique triadic states in which  triads with depressed adolescents spent significantly more time than triads with  healthy controls. The present study enhances understanding of family affective  processes related to depression by taking a more systemic approach and revealing  triadic patterns that go beyond individual and dyadic analyses.

Early life environments interact with genotype to determine stable phenotypic  outcomes. Here we examined the influence of a variant in the brain-derived  neurotropic factor (BDNF) gene (Val66Met), which underlies synaptic plasticity  throughout the central nervous system, on the degree to which antenatal maternal  anxiety associated with neonatal DNA methylation. We also examined the  association between neonatal DNA methylation and brain substructure volume, as a  function of BDNF genotype. Infant, but not maternal, BDNF genotype dramatically  influences the association of antenatal anxiety on the epigenome at birth as  well as that between the epigenome and neonatal brain structure. There was a  greater impact of antenatal maternal anxiety on the DNA methylation of infants  with the methionine (Met)/Met compared to both Met/valine (Val) and Val/Val  genotypes. There were significantly more cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites where  methylation levels covaried with right amygdala volume among Met/Met compared  with both Met/Val and Val/Val carriers. In contrast, more  cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites covaried with left hippocampus volume in  Val/Val infants compared with infants of the Met/Val or Met/Met genotype. Thus,  antenatal Maternal Anxiety × BDNF Val66Met Polymorphism interactions at the  level of the epigenome are reflected differently in the structure of the  amygdala and the hippocampus. These findings suggest that BDNF genotype  regulates the sensitivity of the methylome to early environment and that  differential susceptibility to specific environmental conditions may be both  tissue and function specific.

(2)Harvard University Graduate School of Education. (3)NIH-IRP NIDA Molecular Neurobiology Branch.	The present study examines the interaction between a polygenic score and an  elementary school-based universal preventive intervention trial. The polygenic  score reflects the contribution of multiple genes and has been shown in prior  research to be predictive of smoking cessation and tobacco use (Uhl et al.,  2014). Using data from a longitudinal preventive intervention study, we examined  age of first tobacco use from sixth grade to age 18. Genetic data were collected  during emerging adulthood and were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0  microarray. The polygenic score was computed using these data. Discrete-time  survival analysis was employed to test for intervention main and interaction  effects with the polygenic score. We found a main effect of the intervention,  with the intervention participants reporting their first cigarette smoked at an  age significantly later than controls. We also found an Intervention × Polygenic  Score interaction, with participants at the higher end of the polygenic score  benefitting the most from the intervention in terms of delayed age of first use.  These results are consistent with Belsky and colleagues' (e.g., Belsky,  Bakermans-Kranenburg, & van IJzendoorn, 2007; Belsky & Pleuss, 2009, 2013;  Ellis, Boyce, Belsky, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & van IJzendoorn, 2011) differential  susceptibility hypothesis and the concept of "for better or worse," wherein the  expression of genetic variants are optimally realized in the context of an  enriched environment, such as provided by a preventive intervention.

We conducted a developmental analysis of genetic moderation of the effect of the  Fast Track intervention on adult externalizing psychopathology. The Fast Track  intervention enrolled 891 children at high risk to develop externalizing  behavior problems when they were in kindergarten. Half of the enrolled children  were randomly assigned to receive 10 years of treatment, with a range of  services and resources provided to the children and their families, and the  other half to usual care (controls). We previously showed that the effect of the  Fast Track intervention on participants' risk of externalizing psychopathology  at age 25 years was moderated by a variant in the glucocorticoid receptor gene.  Children who carried copies of the A allele of the single nucleotide  polymorphism rs10482672 had the highest risk of externalizing psychopathology if  they were in the control arm of the trial and the lowest risk of externalizing  psychopathology if they were in the treatment arm. In this study, we test a  developmental hypothesis about the origins of this for better and for worse Gene  × Intervention interaction (G × I): that the observed G × I effect on adult  psychopathology is mediated by the proximal impact of intervention on childhood  externalizing problems and adolescent substance use and delinquency. We analyzed  longitudinal data tracking the 270 European American children in the Fast Track  randomized control trial with available genetic information (129 intervention  children, 141 control group peers, 69% male) from kindergarten through age 25  years. Results show that the same pattern of for better and for worse  susceptibility to intervention observed at the age 25 follow-up was evident  already during childhood. At the elementary school follow-ups and at the  middle/high school follow-ups, rs10482672 predicted better adjustment among  children receiving the Fast Track intervention and worse adjustment among  children in the control condition. In turn, these proximal G × I effects early  in development mediated the ultimate G × I effect on externalizing  psychopathology at age 25 years. We discuss the contribution of these findings  to the growing literature on genetic susceptibility to environmental  intervention.

The conditioning of intervention effects on early adolescent alcohol use by  maternal involvement and dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) and serotonin transporter  linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genetic variants.

Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University. (2)Iowa State University.	Data drawn from the in-home subsample of the PROSPER intervention dissemination  trial were used to investigate the moderation of intervention effects on  underage alcohol use by maternal involvement and candidate genes. The primary  gene examined was dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4). Variation in this gene and  maternal involvement were hypothesized to moderate the influence of intervention  status on alcohol use. The PROSPER data used were drawn from 28 communities  randomly assigned to intervention or comparison conditions. Participating youth  were assessed in five in-home interviews from sixth to ninth grades. A main  effect of sixth-grade pretest maternal involvement on ninth-grade alcohol use  was found. Neither intervention status nor DRD4 variation was unconditionally  linked to ninth-grade drinking. However, moderation analyses revealed a  significant three-way interaction among DRD4 status, maternal involvement, and  intervention condition. Follow-up analyses revealed that prevention reduced  drinking risk, but only for youth with at least one DRD4 seven-repeat allele who  reported average or greater pretest levels of maternal involvement. To determine  if this conditional pattern was limited to the DRD4 gene, we repeated analyses  using the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region site near the  serotonin transporter gene. The results for this supplemental analysis revealed  a significant three-way interaction similar but not identical to that found for  DRD4.

Research findings in psychoneuroimmunology document reliable, bidirectional  linkages among psychological processes, the nervous system, and the immune  system. However, available data are based almost entirely on animal and adult  human studies; the application to children and adolescents is uncertain. We  capitalized on the experimental leverage provided by a routine vaccination to  examine the link between mood symptoms and the immune response to a vaccine  challenge in early adolescence. One hundred twenty-six 11-year-olds for whom  vaccine response data were available were assessed at prevaccination and 4  weeks, 3 months, and 6 months following vaccination; self-report ratings of  depression and anxiety as well as measures of psychosocial and somatic risk were  assessed prior to vaccine response. Analyses indicated that children's  internalizing mood symptoms were associated with elevated and persistently  higher antibody responses, with evidence extending to two of the four  serogroups. The associations remained after controlling for multiple possible  confounders (social class, body mass index, sleep, psychosocial risk, and  pubertal status). The observed enhanced vaccine response associated with  depressive and anxious symptoms in early adolescence may reflect an important  developmental difference in immune system-brain interplay between adults and  children, and it underscores the need for further developmental studies of  psychoneuroimmunology.

Author information: (1)Radboud University Nijmegen.	The majority of aggressive children exhibit symptoms of anxiety, yet none of our  developmental models of aggression incorporate the role of anxiety, and our  treatments ignore this comorbidity. This article outlines a novel theoretical  model that specifies three hypotheses about comorbid anxious and aggressive  children: (a) unpredictable parenting induces anxiety in children that in turn  triggers aggressive behavior; (b) prolonged periods of anxiety deplete  children's capacity to inhibit impulses and trigger bouts of aggression, and  aggression in turn functions to regulate levels of anxiety; and (c) minor daily  stressors give rise to anxiety while cognitive perseveration maintains anxious  moods, increasingly disposing children to aggress. Little or no research has  directly tested these hypotheses. Extant research and theory consistent with  these claims are herein reviewed, and future research designs that can test them  specifically are suggested. The clinical implications most relevant to the  hypotheses are discussed, and to improve the efficacy of treatments for  childhood aggression, it is proposed that anxiety may need to be the primary  target of treatment.

Adolescent internalizing symptoms and negative life events: the sensitizing  effects of earlier life stress and cortisol.	Ruttle PL(1), Armstrong JM(1), Klein MH(1), Essex MJ(1).	Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin-Madison.	Although adolescence is marked by increased negative life events and  internalizing problems, few studies investigate this association as an ongoing  longitudinal process. Moreover, while there are considerable individual  differences in the degree to which these phenomena are linked, little is known  about the origins of these differences. The present study examines early life  stress (ELS) exposure and early-adolescent longitudinal afternoon cortisol level  as predictors of the covariation between internalizing symptoms and negative  life events across high school. ELS was assessed by maternal report during  infancy, and the measure of cortisol was derived from assessments at ages 11,  13, and 15 years. Life events and internalizing symptoms were assessed at ages  15, 17, and 18 years. A two-level hierarchical linear model revealed that ELS  and cortisol were independent predictors of the covariation of internalizing  symptoms and negative life events. Compared to those with lower levels of ELS,  ELS-exposed adolescents displayed tighter covariation between internalizing  symptoms and negative life events. Adolescents with lower longitudinal afternoon  cortisol displayed tighter covariation between negative life events and  internalizing symptoms, while those with higher cortisol demonstrated weaker  covariation, partially due to increased levels of internalizing symptoms when  faced with fewer negative life events.

Evidence now implicates inflammatory proteins in the neurobiology of  internalizing disorders. Genetic factors may influence individual responses to  maltreatment; however, little work has examined inflammatory genetic variants in  adults and none in children. The present study examined the role of an  interleukin 1B gene (IL1B) variant in preschoolers exposed to maltreatment and  other forms of adversity in internalizing symptom development. One hundred  ninety-eight families were enrolled, with one child (age 3-5 years) from each  family. Adversity measures included child protective service documentation of  moderate-severe maltreatment in the last 6 months and interview-assessed  contextual stressors. Internalizing symptoms were measured using the Child  Behavior Checklist and the Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment.  Maltreated children had higher major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic  stress disorder symptoms and marginally higher internalizing symptoms on the  Child Behavior Checklist. Controlling for age, sex, and race, IL1B genotype was  associated with MDD symptoms (p = .002). Contextual stressors were significantly  associated with MDD and posttraumatic stress disorder and marginally with  internalizing symptoms. The IL1B genotype interacted with contextual stress such  that children homozygous for the minor allele had more MDD symptoms (p = .045).  These results suggest that genetic variants of IL1B may modulate the development  of internalizing symptoms in the face of childhood adversity.

Maternal prenatal anxiety and child brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)  genotype: effects on internalizing symptoms from 4 to 15 years of age.	O'Donnell KJ(1), Glover V(2), Holbrook JD(3), O'Connor TG(4).	Author information: (1)McGill University. (2)Imperial College London. (3)Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences. (4)University of Rochester Medical Center.	Multiple behavioral and health outcomes, including internalizing symptoms, may  be predicted from prenatal maternal anxiety, depression, or stress. However, not  all children are affected, and those that are can be affected in different ways.  Here we test the hypothesis that the effects of prenatal anxiety are moderated  by genetic variation in the child's brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)  gene, using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children population  cohort. Internalizing symptoms were assessed from 4 to 13 years of age using the  Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (n = 8,584); a clinical interview with  the adolescents was conducted at age 15 years (n = 4,704). Obstetric and  psychosocial risk and postnatal maternal symptoms were included as covariates.  Results show that prenatal maternal anxiety predicted internalizing symptoms,  including with the diagnostic assessment at 15 years. There was a main effect of  two BDNF polymorphisms (rs6265 [val66met] and rs11030104) on internalizing  symptoms up to age 13. There was also genetic moderation of the prenatal anxiety  effect by different BDNF polymorphisms (rs11030121 and rs7124442), although  significant effects were limited to preadolescence. The findings suggest a role  for BDNF gene-environment interactions in individual vulnerability to the  effects of prenatal anxiety on child internalizing symptoms.

Expression of glucocorticoid inducible genes is associated with reductions in  cornu ammonis and dentate gyrus volumes in patients with major depressive  disorder.

(2)University of Regensburg.	Alterations of the glucocorticoid system and of hippocampal volumes have  consistently been reported in patients with major depressive disorders (MDD).  The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the messenger RNA (mRNA)  expression of glucocorticoid inducible genes is associated with changes in the  cornu ammonis (CA) and dentate gyrus subfields. Forty-three patients with MDD  and 43 healthy controls were recruited and investigated with high resolution  magnetic resonance imaging. Hippocampal subfields were measured using  freesurfer. Measurement of whole blood mRNA expression of glucocorticoid  inducible genes serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1), FK506  binding protein 5 (FKBP5), and glucocorticoid induced leucine zipper (GILZ) was  performed. Patients with MDD had significantly smaller volumes of CA1, CA2/3,  CA4/DG, and subiculum compared to healthy controls. In the regression analysis,  the factor diagnosis had a significant moderating effect on the association of  SGK1 and hippocampal volumes. Patients with low expression of SGK1 had  significantly smaller CA2/3 and CA4/DG volumes compared to patients with high  expression of SGK1 mRNA and to healthy controls with low/high expression of  SGK1, respectively. Therefore, a lack of mRNA expression of glucocorticoid  inducible genes in patients with MDD that seems to correspond to a blunted  cortisol response is associated with smaller hippocampal CA and dentate gyrus  volumes. SGK1 seems to be particularly relevant for stress-related mental  disorders.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414000972 PMID: 25422956 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Familial influences on internalizing symptomatology in Latino adolescents: an  ecological analysis of parent mental health and acculturation dynamics.	Smokowski PR(1), Rose RA(1), Evans CB(1), Cotter KL(1), Bower M(1), Bacallao  M(1).	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.	The aim of this study was to examine if family system dynamics (e.g., parent  mental health, marriage quality, conflict, and cohesion) that have often been  overlooked when studying Latino families play a more important role in  predicting adolescent internalizing symptoms than acculturation processes. Data  comes from the Latino Acculturation and Health Project, a longitudinal  investigation of acculturation in Latino families in North Carolina and Arizona  (Smokowski & Bacallao, 2006, 2010). Researchers conducted in-depth,  community-based interviews with 258 Latino adolescents and 258 of their parents  in metropolitan, small-town, and rural areas. Interviews were conducted at four  time points at intervals of approximately 6 months. Parent and adolescent  ratings of the adolescent's internalizing symptoms were used as the dependent  variable in a longitudinal hierarchical linear model with a rater effects  structure. Results showed that parent-adolescent conflict and parent mental  health (fear/avoidance of social situations and humiliation sensitivity) were  significant predictors of adolescent internalizing symptoms. Acculturation  scales were not significant predictors; however, internalizing symptoms  decreased with time spent in the United States. Females and adolescents from  lower socioeconomic status families reported more internalizing symptoms, while  participants who had been in the United States longer reported fewer  internalizing symptoms. Implications were discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414000960 PMID: 25422955 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Co-development of early adolescent alcohol use and depressive feelings: The role  of the mu-opioid receptor A118G polymorphism.	Kleinjan M(1), Rozing M(1), Engels RC(1), Verhagen M(1).	Author information: (1)Radboud University Nijmegen.	Alcohol use and depressive feelings are often related among early adolescents.  However, the nature and underlying mechanisms of this association are not yet  clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the co-development of alcohol  use and depressive feelings over time and to examine the effects of the  mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) A118G genotype on such co-development. Data from a  five-wave longitudinal, genetically informed survey study, with intervals of 4  months among a group of 739 normative early adolescents (12-13 years of age at  baseline), were analyzed using a dual latent growth curve approach. OPRM1 status  was evaluated from saliva-derived DNA samples. The results indicated a positive  association between alcohol use and depressive feelings both at the initial  levels and over time, indicating co-development in early adolescence. Compared  to OPRM1 118G carriers, homozygous 118A carriers showed a greater increase in  frequency of alcohol use and higher levels of depressive feelings over time.  Evidence for co-development was only found within the group of homozygous 118A  carriers, whereas in OPRM1 118G carriers the development of alcohol use and  depressive feelings over time were not significantly associated. These results  highlight the potential of OPRM1 as a common etiological factor for the  development of alcohol use and depressive feelings in early adolescence.

Describing and predicting developmental profiles of externalizing problems from  childhood to adulthood.	Petersen IT(1), Bates JE(1), Dodge KA(2), Lansford JE(2), Pettit GS(3).	Author information: (1)Indiana University. (2)Duke University. (3)Auburn University.	This longitudinal study considers externalizing behavior problems from ages 5 to  27 (N = 585). Externalizing problem ratings by mothers, fathers, teachers,  peers, and self-report were modeled with growth curves. Risk and protective  factors across many different domains and time frames were included as  predictors of the trajectories. A major contribution of the study is in  demonstrating how heterotypic continuity and changing measures can be handled in  modeling changes in externalizing behavior over long developmental periods. On  average, externalizing problems decreased from early childhood to  preadolescence, increased during adolescence, and decreased from late  adolescence to adulthood. There was strong nonlinear continuity in externalizing  problems over time. Family process, peer process, stress, and individual  characteristics predicted externalizing problems beyond the strong continuity of  externalizing problems. The model accounted for 70% of the variability in the  development of externalizing problems. The model's predicted values showed  moderate sensitivity and specificity in prediction of arrests, illegal drug use,  and drunk driving. Overall, the study showed that by using changing,  developmentally relevant measures and simultaneously taking into account  numerous characteristics of children and their living situations, research can  model lengthy spans of development and improve predictions of the development of  later, severe externalizing problems.

Keenan K(1), Hipwell AE(2), Stepp SD(2), Wroblewski K(1).	Author information: (1)University of Chicago. (2)University of Pittsburgh.	Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a common behavior among females that has been  shown to confer risk for continued self-injury and suicidal attempts. NSSI can  be viewed conceptually as behavior that is pathognomonic with aggression and/or  depression. Empirical research on concurrent correlates supports this concept:  numerous and diverse factors are shown to be significantly associated with  self-harm, including depression, emotion dysregulation, impulsivity, and  aggression and other conduct problems, as well as environmental stressors such  as bullying, harsh parenting, and negative life events. In the present study, we  test hypotheses regarding developmental precursors (measured from ages 8 to 12  years) to NSSI in young adolescent girls (ages 13-14 years), specifically  whether aggression, depression, and environmental stressors distinguish girls  with and without self-harm, and whether there is evidence for multiple  developmental pathways to NSSI. Data were derived from the longitudinal  Pittsburgh Girls Study. In this community sample of girls, the prevalence of  NSSI at ages 13 or 14 years of age was 6.0%. Initial levels in dimensions  measured within the depression, aggression, and environmental stressor domains  accounted for variance in NSSI in early adolescence. Changes over time in  relational aggression and assertiveness were also significantly associated with  risk for NSSI. To a large extent, adolescent NSSI was predicted by psychological  deficits and stress exposure that began early in childhood. Risk indices were  calculated using the 85th or 15th percentile. Close to 80% of girls who engaged  in NSSI during adolescence were identified by at least one risk domain in  childhood. A sizable proportion of adolescent girls who later engaged in NSSI  had childhood risk scores in all three domains; the remaining girls with  adolescent NSSI were relatively evenly distributed across the other risk domain  profiles. The observation that multiple pathways to NSSI exist suggests that  deficits underlying the behavior may vary and require different modes of  prevention.

Developmental cascade models linking childhood physical and relational  aggression with symptoms of depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder (ADHD; assessed at ages 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14) to borderline  personality disorder (BPD) features (assessed at age 14) were examined in a  community sample of 484 youth. Results indicated that, when controlling for  within-time covariance and across-time stability in the examination of  cross-lagged relations among study variables, BPD features at age 14 were  predicted by childhood relational aggression and symptoms of depression for  boys, and physical and relational aggression, symptoms of depression, and  symptoms of ADHD for girls. Moreover, for boys BPD features were predicted from  age 10 ADHD through age 12 depression, whereas for girls the pathway to elevated  BPD features at age 14 was from depression at age 10 through physical aggression  symptoms at age 12. Controlling for earlier associations among variables, we  found that for girls the strongest predictor of BPD features at age 14 was  physical aggression, whereas for boys all the risk indicators shared a similar  predictive impact. This study adds to the growing literature showing that  physical and relational aggression ought to be considered when examining early  precursors of BPD features.

Dwelling on it may make it worse: the links between relational victimization,  relational aggression, rumination, and depressive symptoms in adolescents.	Mathieson LC(1), Klimes-Dougan B(2), Crick NR(2).	Author information: (1)Sunny Hill Health Centre for Children,Vancouver. (2)University of Minnesota.	Although there is considerable evidence that relational victimization is  associated with depressive symptoms in youth, our understanding about the  mechanisms by which victimization and depressive symptoms are linked is limited.  The current study explored ruminating about victimization experiences as a  potential mechanism that might contribute to an understanding of the association  between relational victimization and depressive symptoms. We also tested the  specificity of the proposed models by controlling for and testing parallel  models of a highly related behavior: relational aggression. A sample of 499  adolescents from sixth through eighth grades participated. Teacher reports were  used to assess relational victimization and relational aggression. Self-reports  were used to assess depressive symptoms and rumination. The results showed that  rumination partially mediated the association between relational victimization  and depressive symptoms. No moderation effect was found. In contrast, rumination  moderated the association between relational aggression and depressive symptoms.  Specifically, relational aggression was associated with depressive symptoms for  those adolescents who were also ruminators. Thus, ruminating about victimization  experiences appears to be an important mechanism that functions differently for  relational aggression and relational victimization in conferring risk for  depressive symptoms. The findings offer important practical implications for  those working with adolescents and also lay the groundwork for future research.

In the current study, we addressed several issues related to the forms (physical  and relational) and functions (reactive and proactive) of aggression in  community (n = 307), voluntary residential (n = 1,917), and involuntarily  detained (n = 659) adolescents (ages 11-19 years). Across samples, boys  self-reported more physical aggression and girls reported more relational  aggression, with the exception of higher levels of both forms of aggression in  detained girls. Further, few boys showed high rates of relational aggression  without also showing high rates of physical aggression. In contrast, it was not  uncommon for girls to show high rates of relational aggression alone, and these  girls tended to also have high levels of problem behavior (e.g., delinquency)  and mental health problems (e.g., emotional dysregulation and  callous-unemotional traits). Finally, for physical aggression in both boys and  girls, and for relational aggression in girls, there was a clear pattern of  aggressive behavior that emerged from cluster analyses across samples. Two  aggression clusters emerged, with one group showing moderately high reactive  aggression and a second group showing both high reactive and high proactive  aggression (combined group). On measures of severity (e.g., self-reported  delinquency and arrests) and etiologically important variables (e.g., emotional  regulation and callous-unemotional traits), the reactive aggression group was  more severe than a nonaggressive cluster but less severe than the combined  aggressive cluster.

Author information: (1)University of Illinois,Urbana-Champaign. (2)Arizona State University.	The bully/victim relationship was studied in a sample of elementary school  children (N = 1,289 in first, third, and fifth grades). Three questions were  tested. Does bullying involve a power differential between bully and victim? Are  bully/victim dyads participants in a relationship, whether mutual liking or  disliking? Does the gender composition of the bully/victim dyad moderate power  differential and relational context patterns? Hierarchical linear modeling was  used to analyze predictors of the reputational strength of bully/victim ties.  The findings revealed that the bully/victim dyads most frequently nominated by  peers were characterized by asymmetries in social status, where bullies were  increasingly more popular than their victims, and by asymmetries in aggression,  where bullies were increasingly less aggressive than their victims. Bullies and  victims were likely to select one another as among the children that they least  like. Most effects with respect to aggression, popularity, and relationships  were moderated by the gender composition of the bully/victim dyad. Implications  for a developmental psychopathology perspective on peer bullying and  victimization are highlighted.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579414000327 PMID: 25047292 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The first goal was to examine the association between  two indicators of negative bias in children and their associations with  children's aggression. The second goal was to examine a possible dual role of  social status, operationalized as popularity, as a concurrent correlate of  negative bias and as a moderator of the effect of negative bias on children's  aggression. The roles of gender and type of aggression were also examined.  Participants were 366 fifth- and sixth-grade children (49% girls; M age = 11.07  years, SD = 0.85 year) who completed peer- and self-report measures in their  classrooms. The results showed that the two indicators of negative bias were  associated with each other and with children's aggression. Popularity was weakly  associated with negative bias. However, popularity did moderate the association  of hostile attributions with aggression. The associations of both measures of  negative bias with aggression also varied by gender, with stronger associations  for boys than for girls. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Physiological stress reactivity and physical and relational aggression: the  moderating roles of victimization, type of stressor, and child gender.

The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the association between  physiological reactivity to peer stressors and physical and relational  aggression. Potential moderation by actual experiences of peer maltreatment  (i.e., physical and relational victimization) and gender were also explored. One  hundred ninety-six children (M = 10.11 years, SD = 0.64) participated in a  laboratory stress protocol during which their systolic blood pressure, diastolic  blood pressure, and skin conductance reactivity to recounting a relational  stressor (e.g., threats to relationships) and an instrumental stressor (e.g.,  threats to physical well-being, dominance, or property) were assessed. Teachers  provided reports of aggression and victimization. In both boys and girls,  physical aggression was associated with blunted physiological reactivity to  relational stress and heightened physiological reactivity to instrumental  stress, particularly among youth higher in victimization. In girls, relational  aggression was most robustly associated with blunted physiological reactivity to  relational stressors, particularly among girls exhibiting higher levels of  relational victimization. In boys, relational aggression was associated with  heightened physiological reactivity to both types of stressors at higher levels  of peer victimization and blunted physiological reactivity to both types of  stressors at lower levels of victimization. Results underscore the shared and  distinct emotional processes underlying physical and relational aggression in  boys and girls.	DOI: 10.1017/S095457941400025X PMID: 25047286 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The present study examined the impact of children's maltreatment experiences on  the emergence of externalizing problem presentations among children during  different developmental periods. The sample included 788 youth and their  caregivers who participated in a multisite, prospective study of youth at-risk  for maltreatment. Externalizing problems were assessed at ages 4, 8, and 12, and  symptoms and diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional  defiant disorder, and conduct disorder were assessed at age 14, during  interviews with youth and caregivers. Information about maltreatment allegations  was coded from official records. Latent transition analysis identified three  groups of youth with similar presentations of externalizing problems ("well  adjusted," "hyperactive/oppositional," and "aggressive/rule-breaking") and  transitions between groups from ages 4, 8, and 12. A "defiant/deceitful" group  also emerged at age 12. Girls were generally more likely to present as well  adjusted than boys. Children with recent physical abuse allegations had an  increased risk for aggressive/rule-breaking presentations during the preschool  and preadolescent years, while children with sexual abuse or neglect allegations  had lower probabilities of having well-adjusted presentations during middle  childhood. These findings indicate that persistently severe aggressive conduct  problems, which are related to the most concerning outcomes, can be identified  early, particularly among neglected and physically and sexually abused children.

Prenatal cocaine exposure differentially affects stress responses in girls and  boys: associations with future substance use.

(3)Pennsylvania State University. (4)Yale University School of Medicine.	Prenatal cocaine exposure may affect developing stress response systems in  youth, potentially creating risk for substance use in adolescence. Further,  pathways from prenatal risk to future substance use may differ for girls versus  boys. The present longitudinal study examined multiple biobehavioral measures,  including heart rate, blood pressure, emotion, and salivary cortisol and  salivary alpha amylase (sAA), in response to a stressor in 193 low-income 14- to  17-year-olds, half of whom were prenatally cocaine exposed (PCE). Youth's  lifetime substance use was assessed with self-report, interview, and urine  toxicology/breathalyzer at Time 1 and at Time 2 (6-12 months later). PCE ×  Gender interactions were found predicting anxiety, anger, and sadness responses  to the stressor, with PCE girls showing heightened responses as compared to PCE  boys on these indicators. Stress Response × Gender interactions were found  predicting Time 2 substance use in youth (controlling for Time 1 use) for sAA  and sadness; for girls, heightened sadness responses predicted substance use,  but for boys, dampened sAA responses predicted substance use. Findings suggest  distinct biobehavioral stress response risk profiles for boys and girls, with  heightened arousal for girls and blunted arousal for boys associated with  prenatal risk and future substance use outcomes.

Washburn IJ(1), Capaldi DM(2).	Author information: (1)Oklahoma State University. (2)Oregon Social Learning Center.	Adolescent psychopathology is commonly connected to marijuana use. How changes  in these adolescent antecedents and in adolescent marijuana use are connected to  patterns of marijuana use in the 20s is little understood. Another issue not  clearly understood is psychopathology in the 30s as predicted by marijuana use  in the 20s. This study sought to examine these two issues and the associations  with marijuana disorder diagnoses using a longitudinal data set of 205 men with  essentially annual reports. Individual psychopathology and family  characteristics from the men's adolescence were used to predict their patterns  of marijuana use across their 20s, and aspects of the men's psychopathology in  their mid-30s were predicted from these patterns. Three patterns of marijuana  use in the 20s were identified using growth mixture modeling and were associated  with diagnoses of marijuana disorders at age 26 years. Parental marijuana use  predicted chronic use for the men in adulthood. Patterns of marijuana use in the  20s predicted antisocial behavior and deviant peer association at age 36 years  (controlling for adolescent levels of the outcomes by residualization). These  findings indicate that differential patterns of marijuana use in early adulthood  are associated with psychopathology toward midlife.

Neurobehavioral disinhibition (ND) is a complex condition reflecting a wide  range of problems involving difficulties with emotion regulation and behavior  control. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a physiological correlate of  emotion regulation that has been studied in a variety of at-risk populations;  however, there are no studies of RSA in children with ND. Data were drawn from a  prospective longitudinal study of prenatal substance exposure that included  1,073 participants. Baseline RSA and RSA reactivity to an attention-demanding  task were assessed at 3, 4, 5, and 6 years. ND was assessed at ages 8/9, 11, and  13/14 years via behavioral dysregulation and executive dysfunction composite  measures. Greater exposure to early adversity was related to less RSA reactivity  at 3 years, increases in RSA reactivity from ages 3 to 6 years, and increased  behavioral dysregulation from ages 8/9 to 13/14. RSA reactivity was examined as  a moderator of the association between early adversity and changes in ND. A  significant Early Adversity × RSA Reactivity quadratic interaction revealed that  children with decelerations in RSA reactivity exhibited increases in behavioral  dysregulation, regardless of their exposure to early adversity. However, greater  exposure to early adversity was related to greater increases in behavioral  dysregulation, but only if children exhibited accelerations in RSA reactivity  from ages 3 to 6 years. The results contribute to our understanding of how  interactions across multiple levels of analysis contribute to the development of  ND.

Victims, bullies, and their defenders: a longitudinal study of the coevolution  of positive and negative networks.	Huitsing G(1), Snijders TA(1), Van Duijn MA(1), Veenstra R(1).	Author information: (1)University of Groningen.	The complex interplay between bullying/victimization and defending was examined  using a longitudinal social network approach (stochastic actor-based models).  The (co)evolution of these relations within three elementary schools (Grades 2-5  at Time 1, ages 8-11, N = 354 children) was investigated across three time  points within a year. Most bullies and defenders were in the same grade as the  victims, although a substantial number of bullies and defenders were in other  grades (most often one grade higher). Defenders were usually of the same gender  as the victims, whereas most bullies were boys, with boys bullying both boys and  girls. In line with goal-framing theory, multiplex network analyses provided  evidence for the social support hypothesis (victims with the same bullies  defended each other over time) as well as the retaliation hypothesis (defenders  run the risk of becoming victimized by the bullies of the victims they defend).  In addition, the analysis revealed that bullies with the same victims defended  each other over time and that defenders of bullies initiated harassment of those  bullies' victims. This study can be seen as a starting point in unraveling the  relationship dynamics among bullying, victimization, and defending networks in  schools.

(4)Oregon Social Learning Center.	The emergence and persistence of conduct problems (CPs) during early childhood  is a robust predictor of behavior problems in school and of future  maladaptation. In this study we examined the reciprocal influences between  observed coercive interactions between children and caregivers, oppositional and  aggressive behavior, and growth in parent report of early childhood (ages 2-5)  and school-age CPs (ages 7.5 and 8.5). Participants were drawn from the Early  Steps multisite randomized prevention trial that includes an ethnically diverse  sample of male and female children and their families (N = 731). A  parallel-process growth model combining latent trajectory and cross-lagged  approaches revealed the amplifying effect of observed coercive caregiver-child  interactions on children's noncompliance, whereas child oppositional and  aggressive behaviors did not consistently predict increased coercion. The slope  and initial levels of child oppositional and aggressive behaviors and the  stability of caregiver-child coercion were predictive of teacher-reported  oppositional behavior at school age. Families assigned to the Family Check-Up  condition had significantly steeper declines in child oppositional and  aggressive behavior and moderate reductions in oppositional behavior in school  and in coercion at age 3. Results were not moderated by child gender,  race/ethnicity, or assignment to the intervention condition. The implications of  these findings are discussed with respect to understanding the early development  of CPs and to designing optimal strategies for reducing problem behavior in  early childhood with families most in need.

Mothers with borderline personality and their young children: Adult Attachment  Interviews, mother-child interactions, and children's narrative representations.	Macfie J(1), Swan SA(1), Fitzpatrick KL(1), Watkins CD(1), Rivas EM(1).	Author information: (1)University of Tennessee at Knoxville.	Borderline personality disorder (BPD) involves disruptions in attachment, self,  and self-regulation, domains conceptually similar to developmental tasks of  early childhood. Because offspring of mothers with BPD are at elevated risk of  developing BPD themselves (White, Gunderson, Zanarini, & Hudson, 2003), studying  them may inform precursors to BPD. We sampled 31 children age 4-7 whose mothers  have BPD and 31 normative comparisons. We examined relationships between  mothers' Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) representations (George, Kaplan, &  Main, 1984), mothers' observed parenting, and children's narrative  representations. Replicating previous studies, mothers with BPD were more likely  to be classified as preoccupied and unresolved on the AAI. In a larger sample,  which included the current one, we also replicated two underlying AAI dimensions  found in normative samples (Roisman, Fraley, & Belsky, 2007; Whipple, Bernier, &  Mageau, 2011). Controlling for current mood, anxiety, and other personality  disorders, mothers with BPD were significantly higher than were comparisons on  the preoccupied/unresolved, but not the dismissive, dimension. Children's  narrative representations relevant to disruptions in attachment (fear of  abandonment and role reversal), self (incongruent child and self/fantasy  confusion), and self-regulation (destruction of objects) were significantly  correlated with the preoccupied/unresolved, but not the dismissive, dimension.  Furthermore, mothers' parenting significantly mediated the relationship between  the preoccupied/unresolved dimension and their children's narrative  representations of fear of abandonment.

Neural correlates of cognitive and affective processing in maltreated youth with  posttraumatic stress symptoms: does gender matter?	Crozier JC(1), Wang L(1), Huettel SA(1), De Bellis MD(1).	Author information: (1)Duke University.	We investigated the relationship of gender to cognitive and affective processing  in maltreated youth with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms using functional  magnetic resonance imaging. Maltreated (N = 29, 13 females, 16 males) and  nonmaltreated participants (N = 45, 26 females, 19 males) performed an emotional  oddball task that involved detection of targets with fear or scrambled face  distractors. Results were moderated by gender. During the executive component of  this task, left precuneus/posterior middle cingulate hypoactivation to fear  versus calm or scrambled face targets were seen in maltreated versus control  males and may represent dysfunction and less resilience in attentional networks.  Maltreated males also showed decreased activation in the inferior frontal gyrus  compared to control males. No differences were found in females. Posterior  cingulate activations positively correlated with posttraumatic stress disorder  symptoms. While viewing fear faces, maltreated females exhibited decreased  activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and cerebellum I-VI, whereas  maltreated males exhibited increased activity in the left hippocampus, fusiform  cortex, right cerebellar crus I, and visual cortex compared to their same-gender  controls. Gender by maltreatment effects were not attributable to demographic,  clinical, or maltreatment parameters. Maltreated girls and boys exhibited  distinct patterns of neural activations during executive and affective  processing, a new finding in the maltreatment literature.

Trucco EM(1), Colder CR(1), Wieczorek WF(2), Lengua LJ(3), Hawk LW Jr(1).	Author information: (1)University at Buffalo, SUNY. (2)SUNY Buffalo State. (3)University of Washington.	Developmental-ecological models are useful for integrating risk factors across  multiple contexts and conceptualizing mediational pathways for adolescent  alcohol use, yet these comprehensive models are rarely tested. This study used a  developmental-ecological framework to investigate the influence of neighborhood,  family, and peer contexts on alcohol use in early adolescence (N = 387). Results  from a multi-informant longitudinal cross-lagged mediation path model suggested  that high levels of neighborhood disadvantage were associated with high levels  of alcohol use 2 years later via an indirect pathway that included exposure to  delinquent peers and adolescent delinquency. Results also indicated that  adolescent involvement with delinquent peers and alcohol use led to decrements  in parenting, rather than being consequences of poor parenting. Overall, the  study supported hypothesized relationships among key microsystems thought to  influence adolescent alcohol use, and thus findings underscore the utility of  developmental-ecological models of alcohol use.

Author information: (1)Erasmus Medical Center. (2)Leiden University. (3)Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam.	A vast body of literature shows that maternal depression has long-term adverse  consequences for children. However, only very few studies have documented the  effect of maternal depression on children's ability to process emotional  expressions and even fewer incorporated measures of observed maternal  sensitivity to further tease apart whether it is the symptoms per se or the  associated impact via maternal sensitivity that affects children's developing  emotion-processing abilities. In a large community sample of Dutch preschoolers  (N = 770), we examined independent and mediated effects of maternal depressive  symptoms and sensitivity on children's ability to recognize emotional  expressions using a nonverbal and a verbal task paradigm. Maternal depressive  symptoms predicted less accurate emotion labeling in children, while maternal  sensitivity was associated with more accurate emotion matching, especially for  sadness and anger. Maternal sensitivity did not mediate the observed  associations between mothers' depressive symptoms and children's emotion  recognition, and effects were similar for boys and girls. Given that maternal  depressive symptoms and sensitivity affected nonoverlapping areas of young  children's emotion recognition, prevention and intervention efforts should focus  on both alleviating maternal depressive symptoms and improving maternal  sensitivity at the same time in order to maximize benefit.

This study utilized structural equation modeling to examine the associations  among parental guilt induction (a form of psychological control), youth  cognitive style, and youth internalizing symptoms, with parents and youth  participating in a randomized controlled trial of a family-based group  cognitive-behavioral preventive intervention targeting families with a history  of caregiver depression. The authors present separate models utilizing parent  report and youth report of internalizing symptoms. Findings suggest that  families in the active condition (family-based group cognitive-behavioral group)  relative to the comparison condition showed a significant decline in parent use  of guilt induction at the conclusion of the intervention (6 months  postbaseline). Furthermore, reductions in parental guilt induction at 6 months  were associated with significantly lower levels of youth negative cognitive  style at 12 months. Finally, reductions in parental use of guilt induction were  associated with lower youth internalizing symptoms 1 year following the  conclusion of the intervention (18 months postbaseline).

Broeren S(1), Newall C(1), Dodd HF(1), Locker R(1), Hudson JL(1).	Author information: (1)Macquarie University.	The current study investigated the longitudinal relationships among behavioral  inhibition (BI), life events, and anxiety in a sample of 102 BI children and 100  behaviorally uninhibited (BUI) children aged 3 to 4 years. Children's parents  completed questionnaires on BI, stressful life events, and anxiety symptoms, and  were administered a diagnostic interview three times in a 5-year period. In line  with our hypotheses, negative life events, particularly negative  behavior-dependent life events (i.e., life events that are related to the  children's own behaviors), and the impact of negative life events were  predictive of increases in subsequent anxiety symptoms, the likelihood of having  an anxiety disorder, and increased number of anxiety diagnoses over the 5-year  follow-up period. Experiencing more positive, behavior-independent life events  decreased the risk of being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Furthermore,  differences were found in life events between BI and BUI children. That is, BI  children experienced fewer positive and specifically positive behavior-dependent  life events, and the impact of these positive life events was also lower in BI  children than in BUI children. However, BI did not interact with life events in  the prediction of anxiety problems as hypothesized. Therefore, this study seems  to indicate that BI and life events act as additive risk factors in the  development of anxiety problems.

Author information: (1)Teachers College, Columbia University.	We review evidence on a group recently identified as "at risk," that is, youth  in upwardly mobile, upper-middle class community contexts. These youngsters are  statistically more likely than normative samples to show serious disturbance  across several domains including drug and alcohol use, as well as internalizing  and externalizing problems. Extant data on these problems are reviewed with  attention to gender-specific patterns, presenting quantitative developmental  research findings along with relevant evidence across other disciplines. In  considering possible reasons for elevated maladjustment, we appraise multiple  pathways, including aspects of family dynamics, peer norms, pressures at  schools, and policies in higher education. All of these pathways are considered  within the context of broad, exosystemic mores: the pervasive emphasis, in  contemporary American culture, on maximizing personal status, and how this can  threaten the well-being of individuals and of communities. We then discuss  issues that warrant attention in future research. The paper concludes with  suggestions for interventions at multiple levels, targeting youth, parents,  educators, as well as policymakers, toward reducing pressures and maximizing  positive adaptation among "privileged but pressured" youth and their families.

Comorbidities and continuities as ontogenic processes: toward a developmental  spectrum model of externalizing psychopathology.	Beauchaine TP(1), McNulty T(1).	Author information: (1)Ohio State University.	Erratum in     Dev Psychopathol. 2014 May;26(2):553.	Research on child and adolescent mental health problems has burgeoned since the  inaugural issue of Development and Psychopathology was published in 1989. In the  quarter century since, static models of psychopathology have been abandoned in  favor of transactional models, following the agenda set by editor Dante  Cicchetti and other proponents of the discipline. The transactional approach,  which has been applied to autism, depression, self-injury, and delinquency, (a)  specifies vulnerabilities and risk factors across multiple levels of analysis  spanning genes to cultures, (b) identifies multifinal and equifinal pathways to  psychopathology, and (c) transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.  However, as noted by Rutter and Sroufe (2000), specific mechanisms of  continuity, discontinuity, and comorbidity of psychopathology must be identified  if we wish to understand etiology fully. In this article, we present a model of  early-onset externalizing behavior in which comorbidities and continuities are  viewed as ontogenic processes: products of complex longitudinal transactions  between interdependent individual-level vulnerabilities (e.g., genetic,  epigenetic, allostatic) and equally interdependent contextual risk factors  (e.g., coercive parenting, deviant peer group affiliations, neighborhood  criminality). Through interactions across levels of analysis, some individuals  traverse along the externalizing spectrum, beginning with heritable trait  impulsivity in preschool and ending in antisociality in adulthood. In describing  our model, we note that (a) the approach outlined in the DSM to subtyping  externalizing disorders continues to obscure developmental pathways to  antisociality, (b) molecular genetics studies will likely not identify  meaningful subtypes of externalizing disorder, and (c) ontogenic trait  approaches to psychopathology are much more likely to advance the discipline in  upcoming years.

Author information: (1)Oregon Health and Science University.	The domains of self-regulation, self-control, executive function, inattention,  and impulsivity cut across broad swathes of normal and abnormal development.  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a common syndrome that encompasses a  portion of these domains. In the past 25 years research on  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder has been characterized by dramatic  advances in genetic, neural, and neuropsychological description of the syndrome  as well as clarification of its multidimensional phenotypic structure. The  limited clinical applicability of these research findings poses the primary  challenge for the next generation. It is likely that clinical breakthroughs will  require further refinement in describing heterogeneity or clinical/biological  subgroups, renewed focus on the environment in the form of etiological events as  well as psychosocial contexts of development, and integration of both with  biological understanding.

Cassidy J(1), Jones JD(1), Shaver PR(2).	Author information: (1)University of Maryland. (2)University of California, Davis.	Attachment theory has been generating creative and impactful research for almost  half a century. In this article we focus on the documented antecedents and  consequences of individual differences in infant attachment patterns, suggesting  topics for further theoretical clarification, research, clinical interventions,  and policy applications. We pay particular attention to the concept of cognitive  "working models" and to neural and physiological mechanisms through which early  attachment experiences contribute to later functioning. We consider adult  caregiving behavior that predicts infant attachment patterns, and the  still-mysterious "transmission gap" between parental Adult Attachment Interview  classifications and infant Strange Situation classifications. We also review  connections between attachment and (a) child psychopathology; (b) neurobiology;  (c) health and immune function; (d) empathy, compassion, and altruism; (e)  school readiness; and (f) culture. We conclude with clinical-translational and  public policy applications of attachment research that could reduce the  occurrence and maintenance of insecure attachment during infancy and beyond. Our  goal is to inspire researchers to continue advancing the field by finding new  ways to tackle long-standing questions and by generating and testing novel  hypotheses.

Thinking clearly about the endophenotype-intermediate phenotype-biomarker  distinctions in developmental psychopathology research.	Lenzenweger MF(1).	Author information: (1)State University of New York at Binghamton.	The endophenotype is central to modern developmental psychopathology studies. It  is used in studies seeking to connect the genetic substrates of the panoply of  major mental disorders with processes, tapped by laboratory and other assessment  measures, in the genotype to a behavior/psychopathology pathway. Proposed  originally by Gottesman and Shields (1972; Shields & Gottesman, 1973) 41 years  ago, the endophenotype concept has gained widespread traction in psychopathology  research since the Gottesman and Gould (2003) review. Other concepts broadly  related to the endophenotype notion have also generated discussion in  experimental and developmental psychopathology research. One is the intermediate  phenotype, a concept proffered as a putative alternative formulation to the  endophenotype. Another concept in this intellectual vein is biomarker. The terms  endophenotype, intermediate phenotype, and biomarker have often been used  interchangeably in the psychiatric literature, yielding conceptual confusion.  However, these three terms are not fungible. The recent Research Domain Criteria  proposal from the National Institute of Mental Health has emphasized selected  underlying processes thought to be of developmental etiologic significance to  psychopathology. These selected processes will be the focus of energetic future  research efforts, many of which will make use of the endophenotype and biomarker  research paradigms. In this context, the concepts of endophenotype, intermediate  phenotype, and biomarker are examined critically and contrasted in terms of  meaning, intention, clarity, and intellectual history. This analysis favors use  of the endophenotype concept in genetically informed laboratory and neuroscience  studies of psychopathology. The term intermediate phenotype is perhaps best  restricted to its originally defined meaning in genetics. Biomarker is used to  denote objectively measured biological antecedents or consequences of normal or  pathogenic processes or a physiologic response to a therapeutic intervention.

Author information: (1)University of Minnesota.	Since this journal's inception, the field of adolescent brain development has  flourished, as researchers have investigated the underpinnings of adolescent  risk-taking behaviors. Explanations based on translational models initially  attributed such behaviors to executive control deficiencies and poor frontal  lobe function. This conclusion was bolstered by evidence that the prefrontal  cortex and its interconnections are among the last brain regions to structurally  and functionally mature. As substantial heterogeneity of prefrontal function was  revealed, applications of neuroeconomic theory to adolescent development led to  dual systems models of behavior. Current epidemiological trends, behavioral  observations, and functional magnetic resonance imaging based brain activity  patterns suggest a quadratic increase in limbically mediated incentive  motivation from childhood to adolescence and a decline thereafter. This  elevation occurs in the context of immature prefrontal function, so motivational  strivings may be difficult to regulate. Theoretical models explain this  patterning through brain-based accounts of subcortical-cortical integration,  puberty-based models of adolescent sensation seeking, and neurochemical  dynamics. Empirically sound tests of these mechanisms, as well as investigations  of biology-context interactions, represent the field's most challenging future  goals, so that applications to psychopathology can be refined and so that  developmental cascades that incorporate neurobiological variables can be  modeled.

Marshall PJ(1).	Author information: (1)Temple University.	Developmental psychopathology is not characterized by adherence to one specific  theory but instead serves as an organizational framework in which research is  driven by a number of key assumptions. In the developmental psychopathology  approach, two primary assumptions emphasize the importance of systems thinking  and the utility of multilevel analyses. As will be illustrated here, these  emphases are inextricably linked: a systems approach necessitates a multilevel  approach, such that a level of organization must bring coherence to a level of  mechanisms. Given this assumption, coming to an integrative understanding of the  relation between levels is of central importance. One broad framework for this  endeavor is relational developmental systems, which has been proposed by certain  theorists as a new paradigm for developmental science. The implications of  embracing this framework include the potential to connect developmental  psychopathology with other approaches that emphasize systems thinking and that  take an integrative perspective on the problem of levels of analysis.

Author information: (1)University of Pennsylvania.	The disciplines of developmental psychopathology and behavior genetics are  concerned with many of the same questions about the etiology and course of  normal and abnormal behavior and about the factors that promote typical  development despite the presence of risk. The goal of this paper is to summarize  how research in behavior genetics has shed light on questions that are central  to developmental psychopathology. We briefly review the origins of behavior  genetics, summarize the findings that have been gleaned from several decades of  quantitative and molecular genetics research, and describe future directions for  research that will delineate gene function as well as pathways from genes to  brain to behavior. The importance of environmental contributions, at both  genetic and epigenetic levels, will be discussed. We conclude that behavior  genetics has made significant contributions to developmental psychopathology by  documenting the interplay among risk and protective factors at multiple levels  of the organism, by clarifying the causal status of risk exposures, and by  identifying factors that account for change and stability in psychopathology. As  the tools to identify gene function become increasingly sophisticated, and as  behavioral geneticists become increasingly interdisciplinary in their scope, the  field is poised to make ever greater contributions to our understanding of  typical and atypical development.

Mothers' depressive symptoms and infant negative emotionality in the prediction  of child adjustment at age 3: testing the maternal reactivity and child  vulnerability hypotheses.	Dix T(1), Yan N(1).	Author information: (1)University of Texas at Austin.	This study examined individual differences in how mothers' depressive symptoms  affect children's early adjustment. It tested whether problematic development  among children high in negative emotionality is accentuated by (a) maternal  reactivity, the negative reactivity of mothers with depressive symptoms to  difficult child characteristics; and (b) child vulnerability, the susceptibility  of negatively emotional children to the negative parenting of mothers with  depressive symptoms. Based on 1,364 participants from the NICHD Study of Early  Child Care, results showed that mothers' depressive symptoms predicted greater  risk for adjustment problems at age 3 among children who as infants were high  rather than low in negative emotionality. Increased risk was evident for  behavior problems, low responsiveness, high separation distress, and low social  competence. Mediational tests suggested that increased risk reflected maternal  reactivity: the stronger mothers' depressive symptoms, the more they responded  with negative parenting to children high in negative emotionality. The proposal  that child vulnerability mediates the greater impact of mothers' depressive  symptoms on negatively emotional children was verified only for separation  distress. The results support the proposal that, when mothers are high in  depressive symptoms, aversive characteristics of children and their behavior  increasingly influence early adjustment and do so because they elicit negative  parent behavior.

Developmental trajectory from early responses to transgressions to future  antisocial behavior: evidence for the role of the parent-child relationship from  two longitudinal studies.	Kim S(1), Kochanska G(2), Boldt LJ(2), Nordling JK(2), O'Bleness JJ(2).	Author information: (1)Hanyang University. (2)University of Iowa.	Parent-child relationships are critical in development, but much remains to be  learned about the mechanisms of their impact. We examined the early parent-child  relationship as a moderator of the developmental trajectory from children's  affective and behavioral responses to transgressions to future antisocial,  externalizing behavior problems in the Family Study (102 community mothers,  fathers, and infants, followed through age 8) and the Play Study (186  low-income, diverse mothers and toddlers, followed for 10 months). The  relationship quality was indexed by attachment security in the Family Study and  maternal responsiveness in the Play Study. Responses to transgressions (tense  discomfort and reparation) were observed in laboratory mishaps wherein children  believed they had damaged a valued object. Antisocial outcomes were rated by  parents. In both studies, early relationships moderated the future developmental  trajectory: diminished tense discomfort predicted more antisocial outcomes, but  only in insecure or unresponsive relationships. That risk was defused in secure  or responsive relationships. Moderated mediation analyses in the Family Study  indicated that the links between diminished tense discomfort and future  antisocial behavior in insecure parent-child dyads were mediated by stronger  discipline pressure from parents. By indirectly influencing future developmental  sequelae, early relationships may increase or decrease the probability that the  parent-child dyad will embark on a path toward antisocial outcomes.

The relationship between hippocampal asymmetry and temperament in adolescent  borderline and antisocial personality pathology.	Jovev M(1), Whittle S(1), Yücel M(1), Simmons JG(1), Allen NB(1), Chanen AM(1).	Author information: (1)University of Melbourne, Melbourne.	Investigating etiological processes early in the life span represents an  important step toward a better understanding of the development of personality  pathology. The current study evaluated the interaction between an individual  difference risk factor (i.e., temperament) and a biological risk factor for  aggressive behavior (i.e., atypical [larger] rightward hippocampal asymmetry) in  predicting the emergence of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and antisocial  personality disorder symptoms during early adolescence. The sample consisted of  153 healthy adolescents (M = 12.6 years, SD = 0.4, range = 11.4-13.7) who were  selected from a larger sample to maximize variation in temperament. Interactions  between four temperament factors (effortful control, negative affectivity,  surgency, and affiliativeness), based on the Early Adolescent Temperament  Questionnaire-Revised, and volumetric measures of hippocampal asymmetry were  examined as cross-sectional predictors of BPD and antisocial personality  disorder symptoms. Boys were more likely to have elevated BPD symptoms if they  were high on affiliation and had larger rightward hippocampal asymmetry. In  boys, low affiliation was a significant predictor of BPD symptoms in the  presence of low rightward hippocampal asymmetry. For girls, low effortful  control was associated with elevated BPD symptoms in the presence of atypical  rightward hippocampal asymmetry. This study builds on previous work reporting  significant associations between atypical hippocampal asymmetry and poor  behavioral regulation.

Jalbrzikowski M(1), Krasileva KE, Marvin S, Zinberg J, Andaya A, Bachman P,  Cannon TD, Bearden CE.	Author information: (1)University of California, Los Angeles.	Youths at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis typically exhibit significant  social dysfunction. However, the specific social behaviors associated with  psychosis risk have not been well characterized. We administer the Social  Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a measure of autistic traits that examines  reciprocal social behavior, to the parents of 117 adolescents (61 CHR  individuals, 20 age-matched adolescents with a psychotic disorder [AOP], and 36  healthy controls) participating in a longitudinal study of psychosis risk. AOP  and CHR individuals have significantly elevated SRS scores relative to healthy  controls, indicating more severe social deficits. Mean scores for AOP and CHR  youths are typical of scores obtained in individuals with high functioning  autism (Constantino & Gruber, 2005). SRS scores are significantly associated  with concurrent real-world social functioning in both clinical groups. Finally,  baseline SRS scores significantly predict social functioning at follow-up (an  average of 7.2 months later) in CHR individuals, over and above baseline social  functioning measures (p < .009). These findings provide novel information  regarding impairments in domains critical for adolescent social development,  because CHR individuals and those with overt psychosis show marked deficits in  reciprocal social behavior. Further, the SRS predicts subsequent real-world  social functioning in CHR youth, suggesting that this measure may be useful for  identifying targets of treatment in psychosocial interventions.

Lee MR(1), Chassin L, Villalta IK.	Author information: (1)Arizona State University.	Research has shown a developmental process of "maturing out" of alcohol  involvement beginning in young adulthood, but the precise nature of changes  characterizing maturing out is unclear. We used latent transition analysis to  investigate these changes in a high-risk sample from a longitudinal study of  familial alcoholism (N = 844; 51% children of alcoholics; 53% male, 71%  non-Hispanic Caucasian, 27% Hispanic). Analyses classified participants into  latent drinking statuses during late adolescence (ages 17-22), young adulthood  (ages 23-28), and adulthood (ages 29-40), and characterized transitions among  these statuses over time. The resulting four statuses were abstainers, low-risk  drinkers who typically drank less than weekly and rarely binged or showed  drinking problems, moderate-risk drinkers who typically binged less than weekly  and showed moderate risk for drinking problems, and high-risk drinkers who  typically binged at least weekly and showed high risk for drinking problems.  Maturing out between late adolescence and young adulthood was most common among  initial high-risk drinkers, but they typically declined to moderate-risk  drinking rather than to nonrisky drinking statuses. This suggests that the  developmental phenomenon of maturing out pertains primarily to relatively  high-risk initial drinkers and that many high-risk drinkers who mature out  merely reduce rather than eliminate their risky drinking.

Blunted feedback processing during risky decision making in adolescents with a  parental history of substance use disorders.	Euser AS(1), Greaves-Lord K, Crowley MJ, Evans BE, Huizink AC, Franken IH.	Author information: (1)Erasmus University Rotterdam.	Risky decision making, a hallmark phenotype of substance use disorders (SUD), is  thought to be associated with deficient feedback processing. Whether these  aberrations are present prior to SUD onset or reflect merely a consequence of  chronic substance use on the brain remains unclear. The present study  investigated whether blunted feedback processing during risky decision making  reflects a biological predisposition to SUD. We assessed event-related  potentials elicited by positive and negative feedback during performance of a  modified version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) among high-risk  adolescents with a parental history of SUD (HR; n = 61) and normal-risk controls  (NR; n = 91). HR males made significantly more risky and faster decisions during  the BART than did NR controls. Moreover, HR adolescents showed significantly  reduced P300 amplitudes in response to both positive and negative feedback as  compared to NR controls. These differences were not secondary to prolonged  substance use exposure. Results are discussed in terms of feedback-specific  processes. Reduced P300 amplitudes in the BART may reflect poor processing of  feedback at the level of overall salience, which may keep people from  effectively predicting the probability of future gains and losses. Though  conclusions are tentative, blunted feedback processing during risky decision  making may represent a promising endophenotypic vulnerability marker for SUD.

Psychosocial (im)maturity from adolescence to early adulthood: distinguishing  between adolescence-limited and persisting antisocial behavior.	Monahan KC(1), Steinberg L, Cauffman E, Mulvey EP.	Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh.	In the psychological tradition, desistance from antisocial behavior is viewed as  the product of psychosocial maturation, including increases in the ability to  control impulses, consider the implications of one's actions on others, delay  gratification in the service of longer term goals, and resist the influences of  peers. The present study investigates how individual variability in the  development of psychosocial maturity is associated with desistance from  antisocial behavior in a sample of 1,088 serious juvenile offenders followed  from adolescence to early adulthood (ages 14-25). We find that psychosocial  maturity continues to develop to the midtwenties and that different  developmental patterns of maturation are found among those who desist and those  who persist in antisocial behavior. Compared to individuals who desisted from  antisocial behavior, youths who persisted exhibited diminished development of  psychosocial maturity. Moreover, earlier desistance compared to later desistance  is linked to greater psychosocial maturity, suggesting that there is an  association between desistance from antisocial behavior and normative increases  in psychosocial maturity.

The development of thought problems: a longitudinal family risk study of  offspring of bipolar, unipolar, and well parents.	Klimes-Dougan B(1), Desjardins CD, James MG, Narayan AJ, Long JD, Cullen KR,  Gold PW, Martinez PE.	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota.	There is growing evidence that many offspring of parents with bipolar disorder  (BD) will develop moderate to severe forms of psychopathology during childhood  and adolescence, including thought problems. The purpose of this study was to  evaluate the developmental progression of thought problems within the context of  a family risk study. Repeated assessments of thought problems, spanning  approximately 15 years, were conducted in offspring (N = 192 from 98 families)  of parents diagnosed with BD (O-BD), unipolar depression (O-UNI), or no  significant psychiatric or medical problems (O-WELL). Survival analysis showed  that the O-BD group had the greatest estimated probability of developing thought  problems over time, followed by O-UNI, and then O-WELL and O-BD exhibiting  higher levels of persistence than O-WELL. Parent-reported thought problems in  childhood and adolescence predicted a range of problems in young adulthood.  Disturbances in reality testing and other atypical behaviors are likely to  disrupt progression through important developmental periods and to associate  with poor outcomes. These findings are likely relevant to preventing the  occurrence or progression of problems in offspring of bipolar parents. The study  of thought problems across development represents an important area of continued  research in children at risk for development of affective disorders.

Symptom differentiation of anxiety and depression across youth development and  clinic-referred/nonreferred samples: An examination of competing factor  structures of the Child Behavior Checklist DSM-oriented scales.	Price M(1), Higa-McMillan C, Ebesutani C, Okamura K, Nakamura BJ, Chorpita BF,  Weisz J.	Author information: (1)University of Hawaii, Hilo.	This study examined the psychometric properties of the DSM-oriented scales of  the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, Dumenci, & Rescorla, 2003) using  confirmatory factor analysis to compare the six-factor structure of the  DSM-oriented scales to competing models consistent with developmental theories  of symptom differentiation. We tested these models on both clinic-referred (N =  757) and school-based, nonreferred (N = 713) samples of youths in order to  assess the generalizability of the factorial structures. Although previous  research has supported the fit of the six-factor DSM-oriented structure in a  normative sample of youths ages 7 to 18 (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001), tripartite  model research indicates that anxiety and depressive symptomology are less  differentiated among children compared to adolescents (Jacques & Mash, 2004). We  thus examined the relative fit of a six- and a five-factor model (collapsing  anxiety and depression) with younger (ages 7-10) and older (ages 11-18) youth  subsamples. The results revealed that the six-factor model fit the best in all  samples except among younger nonclinical children. The results extended the  generalizability of the rationally derived six-factor structure of the  DSM-oriented scales to clinic-referred youths and provided further support to  the notion that younger children in nonclinical samples exhibit less  differentiated symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Li JJ(1), Berk MS, Lee SS.	Author information: (1)University of California, Los Angeles.	Although family support reliably predicts the development of adolescent  depression and suicidal behaviors, relatively little is known about the  interplay of family support with potential genetic factors. We tested the  association of the 44 base pair polymorphism in the serotonin transporter linked  promoter region gene (5-HTTLPR), family support (i.e., cohesion, communication,  and warmth), and their interaction with self-reported depression symptoms and  risk for suicide in 1,030 Caucasian adolescents and young adults from the  National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. High-quality family support  predicted fewer symptoms of depression and reduced risk for suicidality. There  was also a significant interaction between 5-HTTLPR and family support for boys  and a marginally significant interaction for girls. Among boys with poor family  support, youth with at least one short allele had more symptoms of depression  and a higher risk for suicide attempts relative to boys homozygous for the long  allele. However, in the presence of high family support, boys with the short  allele had the fewest depression symptoms (but not suicide attempts). Results  suggest that the short allele may increase reactivity to both negative and  positive family influences in the development of depression. We discuss the  potential role of interactive exchanges between family support and offspring  genotype in the development of adolescent depression and suicidal behaviors.

Developmental timing and continuity of exposure to interparental violence and  externalizing behavior as prospective predictors of dating violence.	Narayan AJ(1), Englund MM, Egeland B.	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.	This study investigated the prospective pathways of children's exposure to  interparental violence (EIPV) in early and middle childhood and externalizing  behavior in middle childhood and adolescence as developmental predictors of  dating violence perpetration and victimization at ages 23 and 26 years.  Participants (N = 168) were drawn from a longitudinal study of low-income  families. Path analyses examined whether timing or continuity of EIPV predicted  dating violence and whether timing or continuity of externalizing behavior  mediated these pathways. Results indicated that EIPV in early childhood directly  predicted perpetration and victimization at age 23. There were significant  indirect effects from EIPV to dating violence through externalizing behavior in  adolescence and life stress at age 23. Independent of EIPV, externalizing  behavior in middle childhood also predicted dating violence through  externalizing behavior in adolescence and life stress at age 23, but this  pathway stemmed from maltreatment. These results highlight that the timing of  EIPV and both the timing and the continuity of externalizing behavior are  critical risks for the intergenerational transmission of dating violence. The  findings support a developmental perspective that negative early experiences and  children's externalizing behavior are powerful influences for dating violence in  early adulthood.

Author information: (1)Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development.	Is it always or necessarily the case that common and important parenting  practices are better, insofar as they occur more often, or worse, because they  occur less often? Perhaps, less is more, or some is more. To address this  question, we studied mothers' microcoded contingent responsiveness to their  infants (M = 5.4 months, SD = 0.2) in relation to independent global judgments  of the same mothers' parenting sensitivity. In a community sample of 335  European American dyads, videorecorded infant and maternal behaviors were timed  microanalytically throughout an extended home observation; separately and  independently, global maternal sensitivity was rated macroanalytically.  Sequential analysis and spline regression showed that, as maternal contingent  responsiveness increased, judged maternal sensitivity increased to significance  on the contingency continuum, after which mothers who were even more contingent  were judged less sensitive. Just significant levels of maternal responsiveness  are deemed optimally sensitive. Implications of these findings for typical and  atypical parenting, child development, and intervention science are discussed.

Stress reactivity in war-exposed young children with and without posttraumatic  stress disorder: relations to maternal stress hormones, parenting, and child  emotionality and regulation.	Feldman R(1), Vengrober A, Eidelman-Rothman M, Zagoory-Sharon O.	Author information: (1)Bar-Ilan University.	The current study examined biomarkers of stress in war-exposed young children  and addressed maternal and child factors that may correlate with children's  stress response. Participants were 232 Israeli children aged 1.5-5 years,  including 148 children exposed to continuous war. Similarly, 56 were diagnosed  with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 92 were defined as  exposed-no-PTSD. Child cortisol (CT) and salivary alpha amylase (sAA),  biomarkers of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and  sympathetic-adrenal-medullary arms of the stress response, were measured at  baseline, following challenge, and at recovery. Maternal CT and sAA, PTSD  symptoms, and reciprocal parenting, and child negative emotionality and  regulatory strategies were assessed. Differences between war-exposed children  and controls emerged, but these were related to child PTSD status. Children with  PTSD exhibited consistently low CT and sAA, exposed-no-PTSD displayed  consistently high CT and sAA, and controls showed increase in CT following  challenge and decrease at recovery and low sAA. Exposed children showed higher  negative emotionality; however, whereas exposed-no-PTSD children employed  comfort-seeking strategies, children with PTSD used withdrawal. Predictors of  child CT included maternal CT, PTSD symptoms, low reciprocity, and negative  emotionality. Findings suggest that high physiological arousal combined with  approach strategies may be associated with greater resilience in the context of  early trauma.

Stronach EP(1), Toth SL, Rogosch F, Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester.	Thirteen-month-old maltreated infants (n = 137) and their mothers were randomly  assigned to one of three conditions: child-parent psychotherapy (CPP),  psychoeducational parenting intervention (PPI), or community standard (CS). A  fourth group of nonmaltreated infants (n = 52) and their mothers served as a  nonmaltreated comparison (NC) group. A prior investigation found that the CPP  and the PPI groups demonstrated substantial increases in secure attachment at  postintervention, whereas this change was not found in the CS and the NC groups.  The current investigation involved the analysis of data obtained at a follow-up  assessment that occurred 12 months after the completion of treatment. At  follow-up, children in the CPP group had higher rates of secure and lower rates  of disorganized attachment than did children in the PPI or the CS group. Rates  of disorganized attachment did not differ between the CPP and the NC groups.  Intention to treat analyses also showed higher rates of secure attachment at  follow-up in the CPP group relative to the PPI and the CS groups. However,  groups did not differ on disorganized attachment. Both primary and intention to  treat analyses demonstrated that maternal-reported child behavior problems did  not differ among the four groups at the follow-up assessment. This is the first  investigation to demonstrate sustained attachment security in maltreated  children 12 months after the completion of an attachment theory informed  intervention. The findings also suggest that, although effective in the short  term, parenting interventions alone may not be effective in maintaining secure  attachment in children over time.

The formation of secure new attachments by children who were maltreated: an  observational study of adolescents in foster care.	Joseph MA(1), O'Connor TG(2), Briskman JA(1), Maughan B(1), Scott S(1).	Author information: (1)King's College London. (2)University of Rochester Medical Center.	Children who were maltreated and enter foster care are at risk for maladjustment  and relationship disturbances with foster carers. A popular hypothesis is that  prior attachment relationships with abusive birth parents are internalized and  carried forward to impair the child's subsequent attachment relationships.  However, the empirical base for this model is limited, especially in  adolescence. We examined the attachment patterns of 62 adolescents with their  birth parents and their foster parents; we compared them to a comparison sample  of 50 adolescents in normal-risk families. Attachment was assessed using the  Child Attachment Interview; adolescent-parent interaction quality was assessed  from direct observation; disruptive behavior symptoms were assessed from  multiple informants. Whereas nearly all of the adolescents in foster families  exhibited insecure attachments to their birth mothers (90%) and birth fathers  (100%), nearly one-half were classified as having a secure attachment with their  foster mother (46%) and father (49%); rates of secure attachment toward foster  parents did not differ significantly from the rate in comparison families.  Within the foster care sample, attachment security to the foster mother was  predicted from current observed relationship quality and the duration of current  placement. In addition, attachment quality in foster adolescents was associated  with fewer disruptive behavior symptoms, and this association was equally strong  in foster and comparison families. Our findings demonstrate that there is  substantial potential for maltreated children to change and develop subsequent  secure attachments in adolescence.

Deconstructing the externalizing spectrum: growth patterns of overt aggression,  covert aggression, oppositional behavior, impulsivity/inattention, and emotion  dysregulation between school entry and early adolescence.	Olson SL(1), Sameroff AJ, Lansford JE, Sexton H, Davis-Kean P, Bates JE, Pettit  GS, Dodge KA.	Author information: (1)University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. slolson@umich.edu	The purpose of this study was to determine whether five subcomponents of  children's externalizing behavior showed distinctive patterns of long-term  growth and predictive correlates. We examined growth in teachers' ratings of  overt aggression, covert aggression, oppositional defiance,  impulsivity/inattention, and emotion dysregulation across three developmental  periods spanning kindergarten through Grade 8 (ages 5-13 years). We also  determined whether three salient background characteristics, family  socioeconomic status, child ethnicity, and child gender, differentially  predicted growth in discrete categories of child externalizing symptoms across  development. Participants were 543 kindergarten-age children (52% male, 81%  European American, 17% African American) whose problem behaviors were rated by  teachers each successive year of development through Grade 8. Latent growth  curve analyses were performed for each component scale, contrasting with overall  externalizing, in a piecewise fashion encompassing three developmental periods:  kindergarten-Grade 2, Grades 3-5, and Grades 6-8. We found that most  subconstructs of externalizing behavior increased significantly across the early  school age period relative to middle childhood and early adolescence. However,  overt aggression did not show early positive growth, and emotion dysregulation  significantly increased across middle childhood. Advantages of using subscales  were most clear in relation to illustrating different growth functions between  the discrete developmental periods. Moreover, growth in some discrete  subcomponents was differentially associated with variations in family  socioeconomic status and ethnicity. Our findings strongly affirmed the necessity  of adopting a developmental approach to the analysis of growth in children's  externalizing behavior and provided unique data concerning similarities and  differences in growth between subconstructs of child and adolescent  externalizing behavior.

Predicting internalizing problems in Chinese children: the unique and  interactive effects of parenting and child temperament.	Muhtadie L(1), Zhou Q, Eisenberg N, Wang Y.	Author information: (1)University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.	The additive and interactive relations of parenting styles (authoritative and  authoritarian parenting) and child temperament (anger/frustration, sadness, and  effortful control) to children's internalizing problems were examined in a  3.8-year longitudinal study of 425 Chinese children (aged 6-9 years) from  Beijing. At Wave 1, parents self-reported on their parenting styles, and parents  and teachers rated child temperament. At Wave 2, parents, teachers, and children  rated children's internalizing problems. Structural equation modeling indicated  that the main effect of authoritative parenting and the interactions of  Authoritarian Parenting × Effortful Control and Authoritative Parenting ×  Anger/Frustration (parents' reports only) prospectively and uniquely predicted  internalizing problems. The above results did not vary by child sex and remained  significant after controlling for co-occurring externalizing problems. These  findings suggest that (a) children with low effortful control may be  particularly susceptible to the adverse effect of authoritarian parenting and  (b) the benefit of authoritative parenting may be especially important for  children with high anger/frustration.

The role of life stress and daily  negative emotion.	Doane LD(1), Mineka S, Zinbarg RE, Craske M, Griffith JW, Adam EK.	Author information: (1)Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA. Leah.Doane@asu.edu	Alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning have been  associated with major depression disorder (MDD) and some anxiety disorders. Few  researchers have tested the possibility that high levels of recent life stress  or elevations in negative emotion may partially account for the HPA axis  alterations observed in these disorders. In a sample of 300 adolescents from the  Youth Emotion Project, we examined associations between MDD and anxiety  disorders, dimensional measures of internalizing symptomatology, life stress,  mood on the days of cortisol testing, and HPA axis functioning. Adolescents with  a past MDD episode and those with a recent MDD episode comorbid with an anxiety  disorder had flatter diurnal cortisol slopes than adolescents without a history  of internalizing disorders. Higher reports of general distress, a dimension of  internalizing symptomatology, were also associated with flatter slopes. Negative  emotion, specifically sadness and loneliness, was associated with flatter slopes  and partially accounted for the associations between comorbid MDD and anxiety  disorders and cortisol. The associations between past MDD and cortisol slopes  were not accounted for by negative emotion, dimensional variation in  internalizing symptomatology, or levels of life stress, indicating that flatter  cortisol slopes may also be a "scar" marker of past experiences of MDD.

Cummings EM(1), Merrilees CE, Taylor LK, Shirlow P, Goeke-Morey MC, Cairns E.	Author information: (1)University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA. edward.m.cummings.10@nd.edu	Although relations between political violence and child adjustment are well  documented, longitudinal research is needed to adequately address the many  questions remaining about the contexts and developmental trajectories underlying  the effects on children in areas of political violence. The study examined the  relations between sectarian and nonsectarian community violence and adolescent  adjustment problems over 4 consecutive years. Participants included 999  mother-child dyads (482 boys, 517 girls), M ages = 12.18 (SD = 1.82), 13.24 (SD  = 1.83), 13.61 (SD = 1.99), and 14.66 (SD = 1.96) years, respectively, living in  socially deprived neighborhoods in Belfast, Northern Ireland, a context of  historical and ongoing political violence. In examining trajectories of  adjustment problems, including youth experience with both sectarian and  nonsectarian antisocial behaviors, sectarian antisocial behavior significantly  predicted more adjustment problems across the 4 years of the study. Experiencing  sectarian antisocial behavior was related to increased adolescent adjustment  problems, and this relationship was accentuated in neighborhoods characterized  by higher crime rates. The discussion considers the implications for further  validating the distinction between sectarian and nonsectarian violence,  including consideration of neighborhood crime levels, from the child's  perspective in a setting of political violence.

Vulnerability to depression: a moderated mediation model of the roles of child  maltreatment, peer victimization, and serotonin transporter linked polymorphic  region genetic variation among children from low socioeconomic status  backgrounds.	Banny AM(1), Cicchetti D, Rogosch FA, Oshri A, Crick NR.	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA. banny001@umn.edu	Child maltreatment, peer victimization, and a polymorphism of the serotonin  transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) were examined as predictors of depressive  symptomatology. Children (M age = 11.26, SD = 1.65), including 156 maltreated  and 145 nonmaltreated children from comparable low socioeconomic backgrounds,  provided DNA samples and self-reports of relational peer victimization, overt  peer victimization, and depressive symptoms. Path analysis showed that  relational and overt victimization mediated the association between child  maltreatment and depressive symptoms. Bootstrapping procedures were used to test  moderated mediation and demonstrated that genotype moderated the indirect  effects of relational and overt victimization on child depressive symptoms, such  that victimized children with the long/long variation were at an increased risk  for depressive symptoms compared to victimized children carrying a short allele.  Results highlight the utility of examining process models that incorporate  biological and psychological factors contributing to the development of  depressive symptomatology and provide direction toward understanding and  promoting resilience among high-risk youth from a multiple levels of analysis  approach.

Alemany S(1), Rijsdijk FV, Haworth CM, Fañanás L, Plomin R.	Author information: (1)Departament Biologia Animal, Facultat Biologia, Universitat de Barcelona,  Spain. silvia.alemany@ub.edu	Little is known about how genetic and environmental factors contribute to the  association between parental negativity and behavior problems from early  childhood to adolescence. The current study fitted a cross-lagged model in a  sample consisting of 4,075 twin pairs to explore (a) the role of genetic and  environmental factors in the relationship between parental negativity and  behavior problems from age 4 to age 12, (b) whether parent-driven and  child-driven processes independently explain the association, and (c) whether  there are sex differences in this relationship. Both phenotypes showed  substantial genetic influence at both ages. The concurrent overlap between them  was mainly accounted for by genetic factors. Causal pathways representing  stability of the phenotypes and parent-driven and child-driven effects  significantly and independently account for the association. Significant but  slight differences were found between males and females for parent-driven  effects. These results were highly similar when general cognitive ability was  added as a covariate. In summary, the longitudinal association between parental  negativity and behavior problems seems to be bidirectional and mainly accounted  for by genetic factors. Furthermore, child-driven effects were mainly  genetically mediated, and parent-driven effects were a function of both genetic  and shared-environmental factors.

Author information: (1)Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA. christin.ogle@duke.edu	The present study examined the specificity of autobiographical memory in  adolescents and adults with versus without child sexual abuse (CSA) histories.  Eighty-five participants, approximately half of whom per age group had  experienced CSA, were tested on the autobiographical memory interview.  Individual difference measures, including those for trauma-related  psychopathology, were also administered. Findings revealed developmental  differences in the relation between autobiographical memory specificity and CSA.  Even with depression statistically controlled, reduced memory specificity in CSA  victims relative to controls was observed among adolescents but not among  adults. A higher number of posttraumatic stress disorder criteria met predicted  more specific childhood memories in participants who reported CSA as their most  traumatic life event. These findings contribute to the scientific understanding  of childhood trauma and autobiographical memory functioning and underscore the  importance of considering the role of age and degree of traumatization within  the study of autobiographical memory.

Klahr AM(1), Thomas KM, Hopwood CJ, Klump KL, Burt SA.	Author information: (1)Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.	The behavior genetic literature suggests that genetically influenced  characteristics of the child elicit specific behaviors from the parent. However,  little is known about the processes by which genetically influenced child  characteristics evoke parental responses. Interpersonal theory provides a useful  framework for identifying reciprocal behavioral processes between children and  mothers. The theory posits that, at any given moment, interpersonal behavior  varies along the orthogonal dimensions of warmth and control and that the  interpersonal behavior of one individual tends to elicit corresponding or  contrasting behavior from the other (i.e., warmth elicits warmth, whereas  control elicits submission). The current study thus examined these dimensions of  interpersonal behavior as they relate to the parent-child relationship in 546  twin families. A computer joystick was used to rate videos of mother-child  interactions in real time, yielding information on mother and child levels of  warmth and control throughout the interaction. Analyses indicated that maternal  control, but not maternal warmth, was influenced by evocative gene-environment  correlational processes, such that genetic influences on maternal control and  child control were largely overlapping. Moreover, these common genetic  influences were present both cross-sectionally and over the course of the  interaction. Such findings not only confirm the presence of evocative  gene-environment correlational processes in the mother-child relationship but  also illuminate at least one of the specific interpersonal behaviors that  underlie this evocative process.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, 1101 East  10th Street, Bloomington, IN 47405, USA. cacoyne@indiana.edu	Teenage childbirth is a risk factor for poor offspring outcomes, particularly  offspring antisocial behavior. It is not clear, however, if maternal age at  first birth (MAFB) is causally associated with offspring antisocial behavior or  if this association is due to selection factors that influence both the  likelihood that a young woman gives birth early and that her offspring engage in  antisocial behavior. The current study addresses the limitations of previous  research by using longitudinal data from Swedish national registries and  children of siblings and children of twins comparisons to identify the extent to  which the association between MAFB and offspring criminal convictions is  consistent with a causal influence and confounded by genetic or environmental  factors that make cousins similar. We found offspring born to mothers who began  childbearing earlier were more likely to be convicted of a crime than offspring  born to mothers who delayed childbearing. The results from comparisons of  differentially exposed cousins, especially born to discordant monozygotic twin  sisters, provide support for a causal association between MAFB and offspring  criminal convictions. The analyses also found little evidence for genetic  confounding due to passive gene-environment correlation. Future studies are  needed to replicate these findings and to identify environmental risk factors  that mediate this causal association.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Virginia, P.O. Box 400400,  Charlottesville, VA 22904, USA. crb8v@virginia.edu	Gene-environment correlation (rGE) exists both within and between families.  Between families, accumulating rGE has been used to explain dramatic changes in  phenotypic means over time. The Dickens and Flynn model of increases in  cognitive ability over generational time, for example, suggests that small  changes in phenotype can lead to subsequent reallocation of environmental  resources. This process sets up a reciprocal feedback loop between phenotype and  environment, producing accumulating rGE that can cause large changes in the mean  of ability, even though ability remains highly heritable in cross-sectional  data. We report simulations suggesting that similar processes may operate within  twin and sibling pairs. Especially in dizygotic twins and siblings, small  differences in phenotype can become associated with reallocations of  environmental resources within families. We show that phenotype-environment  effects can account for age-related increases in rGE, rapid differentiation of  siblings raised together, and widely reported increases in the heritability of  behavior during childhood and adolescence.

Author information: (1)Yale University School of Medicine, CT, USA. becky.carlyle@yale.edu	Child neglect is the most prevalent form of child maltreatment in the United  States, and poses a serious public health concern. Children who survive such  episodes go on to experience long-lasting psychological and behavioral problems,  including higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, depression,  alcohol and drug abuse, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and cognitive  deficits. To date, most research into the causes of these life-long problems has  focused on well-established targets such as stress responsive systems, including  the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Using the maternal separation and early  weaning model, we have attempted to provide comprehensive molecular profiling of  a model of early-life neglect in an organism amenable to genomic manipulation:  the mouse. In this article, we report new findings generated with this model  using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, diffuse tensor magnetic  resonance imaging, and behavioral analyses. We also review the validity of the  maternal separation and early weaning model, which reflects behavioral deficits  observed in neglected humans including hyperactivity, anxiety, and attentional  deficits. Finally, we summarize the molecular characterization of these animals,  including RNA profiling and label-free proteomics, which highlight protein  translation and myelination as novel pathways of interest.

Knopik VS(1), Maccani MA, Francazio S, McGeary JE.	Author information: (1)Rhode Island Hospital, RI, USA. valerie_knopik@brown.edu	The period of in utero development is one of the most critical windows during  which adverse intrauterine conditions and exposures can influence the growth and  development of the fetus as well as the child's future postnatal health and  behavior. Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy remains a relatively  common but nonetheless hazardous in utero exposure. Previous studies have  associated prenatal smoke exposure with reduced birth weight, poor developmental  and psychological outcomes, and increased risk for diseases and behavioral  disorders later in life. Researchers are now learning that many of the  mechanisms whereby maternal smoke exposure may affect key pathways crucial for  proper fetal growth and development are epigenetic in nature. Maternal cigarette  smoking during pregnancy has been associated with altered DNA methylation and  dysregulated expression of microRNA, but a deeper understanding of the  epigenetics of maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy as well as how these  epigenetic changes may affect later health and behavior remain to be elucidated.  This article seeks to explore many of the previously described epigenetic  alterations associated with maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy and  assess how such changes may have consequences for both fetal growth and  development, as well as later child health, behavior, and well-being. We also  outline future directions for this new and exciting field of research.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412000776 PMCID: PMC3581096 PMID: 23062304 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Monk C(1), Spicer J, Champagne FA.	Author information: (1)Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.	Prenatal exposure to maternal stress, anxiety, and depression can have lasting  effects on infant development with risk of psychopathology. Although the impact  of prenatal maternal distress has been well documented, the potential mechanisms  through which maternal psychosocial variables shape development have yet to be  fully elucidated. Advances in molecular biology have highlighted the role of  epigenetic mechanisms in regulating gene activity, neurobiology, and behavior  and the potential role of environmentally induced epigenetic variation in  linking early life exposures to long-term biobehavioral outcomes. In this  article, we discuss evidence illustrating the association between maternal  prenatal distress and both fetal and infant developmental trajectories and the  potential role of epigenetic mechanisms in mediating these effects. Postnatal  experiences may have a critical moderating influence on prenatal effects, and we  review findings illustrating prenatal-postnatal interplay and the developmental  and epigenetic consequences of postnatal mother-infant interactions. The in  utero environment is regulated by placental function and there is emerging  evidence that the placenta is highly susceptible to maternal distress and a  target of epigenetic dysregulation.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland. mgill@tcd.ie	A wide range of developmental disorders present with characteristic  psychopathologies and behaviors, with diagnoses including, inter alia, cognitive  disorders and learning disabilities, epilepsies, autism, and schizophrenia.  Each, to varying extent, has a genetic component to etiology and is associated  with cytogenetic abnormalities. Technological developments, particularly  array-based comparative genome hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism  chips, has revealed a wide range of rare recurrent and de novo copy number  variants (CNVs) to be associated with disorder and psychopathology. It is  surprising that many apparently similar CNVs are identified across two or more  disorders hitherto considered unrelated. This article describes the  characteristics of CNVs and current technological restrictions that make  accurately identifying small events difficult. It summarizes the latest  discoveries for individual diagnostic categories and considers the implications  for a shared neurobiology. It examines likely developments in the knowledge base  as well as addressing the clinical implications going forward.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412000739 PMID: 23062300 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455,  USA. cdeyoung@umn.edu	Despite the substantial heritability of nearly all psychological traits, it has  been difficult to identify specific genetic variants that account for more than  a tiny percentage of genetic variance in phenotypes. Common explanations for  this "missing heritability" include massive polygenicity, rare variants,  epigenetics, epistasis, and gene-environment interactions. Gene-trait (G × T)  interaction is another concept useful for understanding the lack of obvious  genetic main effects. Both genes and environments are distal contributors to  human behavior, but the brain is the proximal driver of behavior. The effect of  any single genetic variant is dependent on the configuration of the brain in  which it is expressed. One method to begin studying how single genes interact  with variations in the rest of the brain is to investigate G × T interactions. A  psychological trait reflects a characteristic pattern of psychological function  (and, therefore, of brain function), which has its origin in the cumulative  effects of both the genome and the environment. A trait therefore describes  variation in the broad organismic context in which any single gene operates. We  describe the nature and significance of G × T interactions for understanding  psychopathology and normal trait variation, which are illustrated with empirical  examples.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.  julia.kim-cohen@yale.edu	The past decade has witnessed an exponential growth in studies that have  attempted to identify the genetic polymporphisms that moderate the influence of  environmental risks on mental disorders. What tends to be neglected in these  Gene × Environment (G × E) interaction studies has been a focus on resilience,  which refers to a dynamic pattern of positive adaptation despite the experience  of a significant trauma or adversity. In this article, we argue that one step  toward advancing the field of developmental psychopathology would be for G × E  research to consider resilience instead of focusing almost exclusively on mental  disorders. After providing an up-to-date summary on the expanding definitions  and models of resilience, and the available evidence regarding measured G × E  studies of childhood maltreatment, we discuss why resilience would be a  worthwhile phenotype for studies of measured G × E. First, although G × E  hypotheses require that there be an environmental risk (e-risk) involved in a  causal process that leads to psychopathology, e-risks are typically not included  in the diagnostic criteria for most psychiatric disorders. In contrast,  resilience by definition includes an e-risk. Second, G × E hypotheses require  that there is evidence of variability in response to an environmental stressor,  and resilience often represents the positive end on this continuum of  adaptation. Third, both resilience and G × E are best understood from a  developmental perspective. Fourth, although resilient outcomes are not public  health concerns, the types of adversities (e.g., childhood maltreatment,  poverty, or exposure to natural disasters) that are often investigated in  studies of resilience certainly are. Understanding how some individuals, perhaps  because of their genetic makeup, are able to withstand such adversities can  inform prevention and intervention efforts to improve mental health.

Author information: (1)University of Edinburgh and University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, USA.  wendy.johnson@ed.ac.uk	Without even knowing of their existence, Mendel discovered how genes operate  when they are completely penetrant, although they rarely are, at least with  respect to human personality and psychopathology; yet quantitative genetics  results have conclusively demonstrated their substantial macrolevel influence.  Now we need to understand just how incompletely penetrant genes make their  contributions to psychopathology. Exciting new developments in molecular  genetics and epigenetics provide new insight into gene action in principle but  have been of limited value so far in understanding the emergence of  psychopathology. Some of the most helpful postulates might come from  evolutionary and developmental biology and agricultural breeding experiments. I  describe the all but forgotten evolutionary mechanisms articulated by  Schmalhausen, a Russian evolutionary biologist whose work was suppressed by  Stalin in the 1940s. I focus on Schmalhausen's law, the observation that  organisms living in conditions at the boundary of their tolerance in any one  aspect of existence will be vulnerable to expression of genetic liabilities  related to all other aspects of existence. I show how Schmalhausen's ideas are  relevant to the results of a century-long corn-breeding experiment and the  current concepts of facilitated variation and cryptic genetic variation. I then  discuss the relevance of all of these to understanding genetic influences on  personality and psychopathology.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412000624 PMID: 23062289 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Differential changes in impulsivity and sensation seeking and the escalation of  substance use from adolescence to early adulthood.	Quinn PD(1), Harden KP.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Texas at Austin, A8000, Austin, TX  78712, USA. pdquinn@utexas.edu	Recent evidence suggests that impulsivity and sensation seeking are not stable  risk factors for substance use among adolescents and early adults but rather  that they undergo significant developmental maturation and change. Further,  developmental trends of both personality facets may vary across individuals. In  the current investigation, we used longitudinal data from ages 15 to 26 on 5,632  individuals drawn from the offspring generation of the National Longitudinal  Survey of Youth to examine whether interindividual differences in  intraindividual change in impulsivity and sensation seeking predicted the  escalation of alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use in adolescence and early  adulthood. Latent growth curve models revealed significant individual  differences in rates of change in both personality and substance use.  Age-related changes in personality were positively associated with individual  differences in substance-use change. Individuals who declined more slowly in  impulsivity increased in alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette more rapidly, whereas  individuals who declined more slowly in sensation seeking increased more rapidly  in alcohol use only. Although risk for substance use across the population may  peak during adolescence and early adulthood, this risk may be highest among  those who decline more gradually in impulsivity.

The predictive significance of early caregiving experiences for symptoms of  psychopathology through midadolescence: enduring or transient effects?	Haltigan JD(1), Roisman GI, Fraley RC.	Author information: (1)University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 603 East Daniel Street,  Champaign, IL 61820, USA.	A fundamental question in the discipline of developmental psychopathology is  whether early interpersonal experiences influence maladaptation in enduring or  transient ways. We address this issue by applying a structural modeling approach  developed by us to examine data from the National Institute of Child Health and  Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development on maternal  sensitivity in the first 3 years of life and its association with symptoms of  psychopathology through age 15. Results suggest that there may be enduring  effects of early caregiving experiences on symptomatology as rated by teachers,  although such effects were not found for maternal report. Additional analyses  indicated that enduring associations found via teacher report could not be fully  accounted for by continuity in caregiving experiences or by early contextual  adversity.

The impact of a family-centered intervention on the ecology of adolescent  antisocial behavior: modeling developmental sequelae and trajectories during  adolescence.	Van Ryzin MJ(1), Dishion TJ.	Author information: (1)Child and Family Center, University of Oregon, 195 West 12th Avenue, Eugene,  OR 97401-3408, USA. markv@uoregon.edu	This study used an experimental, longitudinal field trial involving random  assignment to the Family Check-Up (FCU) to explore the social ecology of  adolescent antisocial behavior. A sample of 998 youths and their families was  followed from early to late adolescence (age 12 to 18-19). In the intervention  condition, 115 families (23%) elected to receive the FCU. In general, random  assignment to the FCU in middle school was associated with reductions in late  adolescence antisocial behavior (age 18-19). Variable-centered analyses revealed  that the effects were mediated by reductions in family conflict from early to  middle adolescence (age 12-15). The link between family conflict and antisocial  behavior in turn was mediated by association with deviant peers at age 17;  parental monitoring at age 17 was also influential but did not attain the status  of a mediator. Person-oriented analyses suggested that the FCU was associated  with declining trajectories of family conflict and rising trajectories of  parental monitoring but was not associated with trajectories of deviant peer  association. A dual-trajectory analysis indicated that the pathways to  adolescent antisocial behavior were myriad and varied, suggesting new directions  for developmental and intervention research.

Author information: (1)Unit on Affective Cognitive Neuroscience, National Institute of Mental  Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.	Using behavioral and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response indices  through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the current study  investigated whether youths with disruptive behavior disorders (conduct disorder  and oppositional defiant disorder) plus psychopathic traits (DBD + PT) show  aberrant sensitivity to eye gaze information generally and/or whether they show  particular insensitivity to eye gaze information in the context of fearful  expressions. The participants were 36 children and adolescents (ages 10-17  years); 17 had DBD + PT and 19 were healthy comparison subjects. Participants  performed a spatial attention paradigm where spatial attention was cued by eye  gaze in faces displaying fearful, angry, or neutral affect. Eye gaze sensitivity  was indexed both behaviorally and as BOLD response. There were no group  differences in behavioral response: both groups showed significantly faster  responses if the target was in the congruent spatial direction indicated by eye  gaze. Neither group showed a Congruence × Emotion interaction; neither group  showed an advantage from the displayer's emotional expression behaviorally.  However, the BOLD response revealed a significant Group × Congruence × Emotion  interaction. The comparison youth showed increased activity within the dorsal  endogenous orienting network (superior parietal lobule and inferior parietal  sulcus) for fearful congruent relative to incongruent trials relative to the  youth with DBD + PT. The results are discussed with reference to current models  of DBD + PT and possible treatment innovations.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412000569 PMCID: PMC3941702 PMID: 22781874 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)University of Georgia, Center for Family Research, 1095 College Station Road,  Athens, GA 30602-4527, USA. gbrody@uga.edu	This study was designed to examine the prospective relations of life stress and  genetic status with increases in drug use. African Americans (N = 399) in rural  Georgia (Wave 1 mean age = 17 years) provided three waves of data across 27.5  months and a saliva sample from which the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene was  genotyped. Multilevel growth curve modeling analysis indicated that emerging  adults manifested the highest escalations in drug use when they reported high  life stress and carried an allele of DRD4 with 7 or more repeats (7 + R allele).  In addition, emerging adults who reported high life stress and carried the 7 + R  allele evinced the largest increases in two proximal risk factors for drug use:  affiliations with drug-using companions and drug use vulnerability cognitions.  Furthermore, when the Gene × Environment interaction effects on the increases in  affiliations with drug-using companions and vulnerability cognitions were  entered into the model forecasting drug use, the Life Stress × DRD4 Status  interaction on drug use became nonsignificant in the presence of the risk  mechanisms. This finding provides an example of "second generation" Gene ×  Environment interaction research in which the interaction's effects on proximal  risk mechanisms account for its effects on outcomes.

Kerr DC(1), Capaldi DM, Pears KC, Owen LD.	Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center, Eugene, OR 97401, USA. davidk@oslc.org	Conduct problems are a general risk factor for adolescent alcohol use. However,  their role in relation to alcohol-specific risk pathways of intergenerational  transmission of alcohol use is not well understood. Further, the roles of  alcohol-specific contextual influences on children's early alcohol use have been  little examined. In a 20-year prospective, multimethod study of 83 fathers and  their 125 children, we considered the predictors of child alcohol use by age 13  years. The predictors included fathers' adolescent antisocial behavior and  alcohol use, both parents' adult alcohol use, norms about and encouragement of  child use, parental monitoring, child-reported exposure to intoxicated adults,  and parent-reported child externalizing behaviors. Path models supported an  association between fathers' adolescent alcohol use and children's use (β =  0.17) that was not better explained by concurrent indicators of fathers' and  children's general problem behavior. Fathers' and mothers' adult alcohol use  uniquely predicted child use, and exposure to intoxicated adults partially  mediated the latter path. Other family risk mechanisms were not supported.  However, parental alcohol use and child alcohol use were linked in expected ways  with family contextual conditions known to set the stage for alcohol use  problems later in adolescence.

Author information: (1)Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology, University of  Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627-0266, USA. mandi.burnette@rochester.edu	We tested for gender moderation within a multidomain model of antisocial  behavior (ASB) among community youth, drawn from the Project on Human  Development in Chicago Neighborhoods study. Youths (N = 1,639) were 9 to 12  years old at baseline and were followed for two additional waves, spaced  approximately 2.5 years apart. We hypothesized that harsh and physically  coercive parenting, a familial level risk factor, would impact individual level  risk factors for ASB, such as childhood temperament ratings of emotionality and  inhibitory control, and preadolescent externalizing and internalizing symptoms,  as well as involvement with antisocial peers. We further hypothesized that this  process and its impact on ASB would be moderated by gender. We used both  multiple indicator multiple causes and multiple group analyses to test for  gender moderation and a structural equation modeling multiple mediation  framework to evaluate the strength of indirect effects. We tested the role of  family, individual, and peer level influences on ASB, after accounting for the  role of known contextual factors, including poverty, race, and neighborhood. Our  overall model fit the data well for males and females, indicating harsh  parenting, disinhibition, emotionality, and peers exert a strong influence on  risk for ASB. Gender moderated the pathway from harsh parenting to externalizing  behavior, such that this was a significant pathway for girls, but not boys. We  discussed the importance of these findings with regard to intervention planning  for youth at risk for ASB and future gender-informed models of ASB.

Author information: (1)Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology, University of  Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA. patrick.davies@rochester.edu	Two studies examined the nature and processes underlying the joint role of  interparental aggression and maternal antisocial personality as predictors of  children's disruptive behavior problems. Participants for both studies included  a high-risk sample of 201 mothers and their 2-year-old children in a  longitudinal, multimethod design. Addressing the form of the interplay between  interparental aggression and maternal antisocial personality as risk factors for  concurrent and prospective levels of child disruptive problems, the Study 1  findings indicated that maternal antisocial personality was a predictor of the  initial levels of preschooler's disruptive problems independent of the effects  of interparental violence, comorbid forms of maternal psychopathology, and  socioeconomic factors. In attesting to the salience of interparental aggression  in the lives of young children, latent difference score analyses further  revealed that interparental aggression mediated the link between maternal  antisocial personality and subsequent changes in child disruptive problems over  a 1-year period. To identify the family mechanisms that account for the two  forms of intergenerational transmission of disruptive problems identified in  Study 1, Study 2 explored the role of children's difficult temperament,  emotional reactivity to interparental conflict, adrenocortical reactivity in a  challenging parent-child task, and experiences with maternal parenting as  mediating processes. Analyses identified child emotional reactivity to conflict  and maternal unresponsiveness as mediators in pathways between interparental  aggression and preschooler's disruptive problems. The findings further supported  the role of blunted adrenocortical reactivity as an allostatic mediator of the  associations between parental unresponsiveness and child disruptive problems.

Liu J(1), Portnoy J, Raine A.	Author information: (1)Department of Criminology, University of Pennsylvania, 3809 Walnut Street,  Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.	Prenatal androgen exposure has been associated with aggressive behavior in  adults. It is less clear whether this association holds for childhood  externalizing behavior. This study tests the hypothesis that increased prenatal  androgen exposure is associated with aggressive behavior and attention problems  in childhood. The ratio of the length of the second finger digit relative to the  fourth digit, which is a marker for prenatal testosterone exposure, was assessed  in 239 male and female fifth grade schoolchildren from Jintan, China, together  with parent and teacher ratings of aggression and attention problems. Increased  aggression and attention problems were both significantly associated with a  lower ratio of the length of the second finger digit relative to the fourth  digit ratios in boys but not girls. The effects remained significant after  controlling for early adversity. These findings are the first to establish a  relationship between an indirect indicator of fetal androgen exposure and any  child psychopathology in Chinese children, and the observed effect size in boys  was stronger than in male adults in Western studies. The results provide limited  cross-cultural support for the importance of prenatal androgen exposure in  contributing to the development of externalizing behavior problems in children,  and they suggest that such effects may be specific to boys who may be relatively  more vulnerable to early prenatal influences.

Box 281, Stockholm 171 77, Sweden. ralf.kuja-halkola@ki.se	Children born to older fathers are at higher risk to develop severe  psychopathology (e.g., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), possibly because of  increased de novo mutations during spermatogenesis with older paternal age.  Because severe psychopathology is correlated with antisocial behavior, we  examined possible associations between advancing paternal age and offspring  violent offending. Interlinked Swedish national registers provided information  on fathers' age at childbirth and violent criminal convictions in all offspring  born from 1958 to 1979 (N = 2,359,921). We used ever committing a violent crime  and number of violent crimes as indices of violent offending. The data included  information on multiple levels; we compared differentially exposed siblings in  within-family analyses to rigorously test causal influences. In the entire  population, advancing paternal age predicted offspring violent crime according  to both indices. Congruent with a causal effect, this association remained for  rates of violent crime in within-family analyses. However, in within-family  analyses, we found no association with ever committing a violent crime,  suggesting that factors shared by siblings (genes and environment) confounded  this association. Life-course persistent criminality has been proposed to have a  partly biological etiology; our results agree with a stronger biological effect  (i.e., de novo mutations) on persistent violent offending.

Wolff BC(1), Wadsworth ME, Wilhelm FH, Mauss IB.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Denver, 2155 South Race Street,  Denver, CO 80208, USA. bwolff@du.edu	Social support and vagal regulatory capacity (VRC), an index of flexible vagal  responses during various types of stress, are linked to attenuated stress  responding and positive health outcomes. Guided by the polyvagal perspective, we  tested whether children's VRC is associated with attenuated sympathetic nervous  system (SNS) stress reactivity in socially supportive conditions. Sixty-one 4-  to 5-year-old children living in poverty underwent two standardized laboratory  stress induction procedures. Cardiac vagal reactivity (respiratory sinus  arrhythmia) to a first set of stressors (social, cognitive, physical, and  emotional) indexed VRC. During a second set of stressors, participants were  randomly assigned to a supportive or nonsupportive social context, and cardiac  sympathetic reactivity (preejection period) was assessed. We hypothesized VRC  would predict lower SNS stress reactivity, but only in the socially supportive  context. Children with high VRC showed attenuated SNS stress reactivity in the  socially supportive context compared to children with high VRC in the  nonsupportive context and children with low VRC in either context. Individual  differences in VRC predict attenuated SNS stress reactivity in socially  supportive conditions. Understanding how social support and VRC jointly mitigate  SNS stress reactivity may further efforts to prevent negative health outcomes.  Implications for biological sensitivity to context and differential  susceptibility theories are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579412000247 PMID: 22559139 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Personality of parents with bipolar disorder and interpersonal functioning among  their offspring: a prospective 10-year study.	Ostiguy CS(1), Ellenbogen MA, Hodgins S.	Author information: (1)Concordia University.	A comparison of offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (OBD) and offspring  of parents with no mental disorder (ONMD) showed that parents' neuroticism was  associated with internalizing and externalizing problems among their children.  The present study examined whether parents' neuroticism predicted poor  interpersonal functioning among offspring 10 years later and whether the  problems observed in middle childhood mediated the association between parents'  neuroticism and offspring functioning. When offspring were in middle childhood,  parents completed the revised NEO Personality Inventory and rated the child's  behavior on the Child Behavior Checklist. Ten years later, 65 OBD and 59 ONMD  completed interviews assessing mental disorders and interpersonal and  noninterpersonal functioning. High neuroticism and low agreeableness in parents  predicted poor interpersonal functioning in their offspring in late  adolescence-early adulthood. The offspring's externalizing and internalizing  problems in middle childhood partially mediated the association between parents'  personality and offspring interpersonal functioning. Moreover, the association  between parents' neuroticism and offspring internalizing problems was stronger  among the OBD than the ONMD. Overall, the results suggested an intergenerational  transmission of risk whereby high neuroticism and low agreeableness in parents  were associated with behavioral problems among offspring in middle childhood  that, in turn, predicted poor interpersonal functioning 10 years later.

Author information: (1)University of California, Davis, 1307 Henry Street, Berkeley, CA 94709-1928,  USA. eewerner@ucdavis.edu	This article reviews and reflects on studies that have explored the effects of  war on children around the world. Most are cross-sectional and based on  self-reports. They describe a range of mental health problems, related to dose  effects and to the negative impact of being a victim or witness of violent acts,  threats to and loss of loved ones, prolonged parental absence, and forced  displacement. The more recent the exposure to war, and the older the child, the  higher was the likelihood of reported posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.  Especially vulnerable to long-term emotional distress were child soldiers,  children who were raped, and children who had been forcibly displaced. In  adulthood, war-traumatized children displayed significantly increased risks for  a wide range of medical conditions, especially cardiovascular diseases. Among  protective factors that moderated the impact of war-related adversities in  children were a strong bond between the primary caregiver and the child, the  social support of teachers and peers, and a shared sense of values. Among the  few documented intervention studies for children of war, school-based  interventions, implemented by teachers or locally trained paraprofessionals,  proved to be a feasible and low-cost alternative to individual or group therapy.  More longitudinal research with multiple informants is needed to document the  trajectories of risk and resilience in war-affected children, to assess their  long-term development and mental health, and to identify effective treatment  approaches.

Roisman GI(1), Newman DA, Fraley RC, Haltigan JD, Groh AM, Haydon KC.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, 603  East Daniel Street, Champaign, IL 61820, USA. roisman@illinois.edu	This report describes the state of the art in distinguishing data generated by  differential susceptibility from diathesis-stress models. We discuss several  limitations of existing practices for probing interaction effects and offer  solutions that are designed to better differentiate differential susceptibility  from diathesis-stress models and quantify their corresponding implications. In  addition, we demonstrate the utility of these methods by revisiting published  evidence suggesting that temperamental difficulty serves as a marker of enhanced  susceptibility to early maternal caregiving across a range of outcome domains in  the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. We find that, with  the exception of mother reports of psychopathology, there is consistent evidence  in the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development that the predictive  significance of early sensitivity is moderated by difficult temperament over  time. However, differential susceptibility effects emerged primarily for teacher  reports of academic skills, social competence, and symptomatology. In contrast,  effects more consistent with the diathesis-stress model were obtained for mother  reports of social skills and objective tests of academic skills. We conclude by  discussing the value of the application of this work to the next wave of Gene ×  Environment studies focused on early caregiving experiences.

Belsky DW(1), Caspi A, Arseneault L, Bleidorn W, Fonagy P, Goodman M, Houts R,  Moffitt TE.	Author information: (1)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA. dbelsky@unc.edu	It has been reported that borderline personality related characteristics can be  observed in children, and that these characteristics are associated with  increased risk for the development of borderline personality disorder. It is not  clear whether borderline personality related characteristics in children share  etiological features with adult borderline personality disorder. We investigated  the etiology of borderline personality related characteristics in a longitudinal  cohort study of 1,116 pairs of same-sex twins followed from birth through age 12  years. Borderline personality related characteristics measured at age 12 years  were highly heritable, were more common in children who had exhibited poor  cognitive function, impulsivity, and more behavioral and emotional problems at  age 5 years, and co-occurred with symptoms of conduct disorder, depression,  anxiety, and psychosis. Exposure to harsh treatment in the family environment  through age 10 years predicted borderline personality related characteristics at  age 12 years. This association showed evidence of environmental mediation and  was stronger among children with a family history of psychiatric illness,  consistent with diathesis-stress models of borderline etiology. Results indicate  that borderline personality related characteristics in children share  etiological features with borderline personality disorder in adults and suggest  that inherited and environmental risk factors make independent and interactive  contributions to borderline etiology.

Inner speech is used to mediate short-term memory, but not planning, among  intellectually high-functioning adults with autism spectrum disorder.	Williams DM(1), Bowler DM, Jarrold C.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Durham University, Science Laboratories, South  Road, Durham DH1 3LE, UK. david.williams@durham.ac.uk	Evidence regarding the use of inner speech by individuals with autism spectrum  disorder (ASD) is equivocal. To clarify this issue, the current study employed  multiple techniques and tasks used across several previous studies. In  Experiment 1, participants with and without ASD showed highly similar patterns  and levels of serial recall for visually presented stimuli. Both groups were  significantly affected by the phonological similarity of items to be recalled,  indicating that visual material was spontaneously recoded into a verbal form.  Confirming that short-term memory is typically verbally mediated among the  majority of people with ASD, recall performance among both groups declined  substantially when inner speech use was prevented by the imposition of  articulatory suppression during the presentation of stimuli. In Experiment 2,  planning performance on a tower of London task was substantially detrimentally  affected by articulatory suppression among comparison participants, but not  among participants with ASD. This suggests that planning is not verbally  mediated in ASD. It is important that the extent to which articulatory  suppression affected planning among participants with ASD was uniquely  associated with the degree of their observed and self-reported communication  impairments. This confirms a link between interpersonal communication with  others and intrapersonal communication with self as a means of higher order  problem solving.

Dix T(1), Meunier LN, Lusk K, Perfect MM.	Author information: (1)Department of Human Development and Family Sciences, University of Texas at  Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA. teddix@mail.utexas.edu	Vibrant expression of emotion is the principal means infants and young children  use to elicit appropriate and timely caregiving, stimulation, and support. This  study examined the depression-inhibition hypothesis: that declines in mothers'  support as their depressive symptoms increase inhibit children's emotional  communication. Ninety-four mothers and their 14- to 27-month-olds interacted in  a university playroom. Based on microanalytic coding of discrete facial  displays, results supported three components of the hypothesis. (a) As mothers'  depressive symptoms increased, children displayed less facial emotion (more flat  affect, less joy, less sadness, less negative). (b) Mothers' low emotional and  behavioral support predicted children's low facial communication and mediated  relations between mothers' depressive symptoms and children's infrequent  emotion. (c) Children who were passive with mothers behaviorally expressed  emotion infrequently. Children's passivity mediated relations between mothers'  depressive symptoms and children's infrequent emotion displays. Contrary to  modeling and contagion theories, mothers' facial displays did not mediate  relations between their depressive symptoms and children's facial displays. Nor  were the outcomes children experienced regulating their facial displays. Rather,  findings suggest that, even when depressive symptoms are modest, young children  inhibit emotion as mothers' depressive symptoms increase to withdraw from  unresponsive mothers, which may adversely affect children's subsequent  relationships and competencies.

Differential patterns of whole-genome DNA methylation in institutionalized  children and children raised by their biological parents.	Naumova OY(1), Lee M, Koposov R, Szyf M, Dozier M, Grigorenko EL.	Author information: (1)Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.	Previous studies with nonhuman species have shown that animals exposed to early  adversity show differential DNA methylation relative to comparison animals. The  current study examined differential methylation among 14 children raised since  birth in institutional care and 14 comparison children raised by their  biological parents. Blood samples were taken from children in middle childhood.  Analysis of whole-genome methylation patterns was performed using the Infinium  HumanMethylation27 BeadChip assay (Illumina), which contains 27,578 CpG sites,  covering approximately 14,000 gene promoters. Group differences were registered,  which were characterized primarily by greater methylation in the  institutionalized group relative to the comparison group, with most of these  differences in genes involved in the control of immune response and cellular  signaling systems, including a number of crucial players important for neural  communication and brain development and functioning. The findings suggest that  patterns of differential methylation seen in nonhuman species with altered  maternal care are also characteristic of children who experience early maternal  separation.

Buss KA(1), Davis EL, Kiel EJ.	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA. kbuss@psu.edu	Psychobiological models of allostatic load have delineated the effects of  multiple processes that contribute to risk for psychopathology. This approach  has been fruitful, but the interactive contributions of allostatic and  environmental load remain understudied in early childhood. Because this  developmental period encompasses the emergence of internalizing problems and  biological sensitivity to early experiences, this is an important time to  examine this process. In two studies, we examined allostatic and environmental  load and links to subsequent internalizing and externalizing problems. Study 1  examined relations between load indices and maladjustment, concurrently and at  multiple times between age 2 and kindergarten; Study 2 added more comprehensive  risk indices in a sample following a group of highly fearful toddlers from 2 to  3 years of age. Results from both studies showed that increased allostatic load  related to internalizing problems as environmental risk also increased. Study 2,  in addition, showed that fearfulness interacted with allostatic and  environmental load indices to predict greater anxiety among the fearful children  who had high levels of allostatic and environmental load. Taken together, the  findings support a model of risk for internalizing characterized by the  interaction of biological and environmental stressors, and demonstrate the  importance of considering individual differences and environmental context in  applying models of allostatic load to developmental change in early childhood.

Author information: (1)Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.  tom.hildebrandt@mssm.edu	Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AASs) are synthetic hormones used by individuals  who want to look better or perform better in athletics and at the gym. Their use  raises an interesting paradox in which drug use is associated with a number of  health benefits, but also the possibility of negative health consequences.  Existing models of AAS addiction follow the traditional framework of drug abuse  and dependence, which suggest that harmful use occurs as a result of the drug's  ability to hijack the motivation-reward system. However, AASs, unlike typical  drugs of abuse, are not used for acute intoxication effects or euphoria. Rather,  AASs are used to affect the body through changes to the musculoskeletal system  and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis as opposed to stimulating the reward  system. We offer an allostatic model of AAS addiction to resolve this  inconsistency between traditional drug addiction and AAS addiction. This  allostatic framework provides a way to (a) incorporate exercise into AAS misuse,  (b) identify where AAS use transitions from recreational use into a drug  problem, and (c) describe individual differences in vulnerability or resilience  to AASs. Implications for this model of AAS addiction are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579411000393 PMID: 21756441 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The impact of allostatic load on maternal sympathovagal functioning in stressful  child contexts: implications for problematic parenting.	Sturge-Apple ML(1), Skibo MA, Rogosch FA, Ignjatovic Z, Heinzelman W.	Author information: (1)University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA.  melissa.sturge-apple@rochester.edu	The present study applies an allostatic load framework to an examination of the  relationship between maternal psychosocial risk factors and maladaptive  parenting behaviors. Specifically, the implications of low socioeconomic status  and maternal depressive symptoms for maternal sympathovagal functioning during  young children's distress were examined, as well as whether that functioning  was, in turn, associated with maternal insensitivity, hostility, intrusiveness,  and disengagement during mother-child dyadic interaction. Consistent with an  allostatic framework, three patterns of sympathovagal functioning were expected  to emerge: normative arousal, hyperarousal, and hypoarousal profiles.  Furthermore, meaningful associations between maternal psychosocial risk factors,  maladaptive parenting behaviors, and the three profiles of sympathovagal  functioning were anticipated. Participants included 153 mother-toddler dyads  recruited proportionately from lower and middle socioeconomic status  backgrounds. Mothers' sympathovagal response to their child's distress was  assessed during the Strange Situation paradigm, and mothers' parenting behavior  was assessed during a dyadic free-play interaction. As hypothesized, normative  arousal, hyperarousal, and hypoarousal profiles of maternal sympathovagal  functioning were identified. Maternal depressive symptomatology predicted the  hyperarousal profile, whereas socioeconomic adversity predicted hypoarousal.  Moreover, allostatic load profiles were differentially associated with  problematic parenting behaviors. These findings underscore the role of  physiological dysregulation as a mechanism in the relationship between proximal  risk factors and actual maladaptive parenting behaviors.

We next explore perspectives on severe mental illness,  dementia, and caregiving as unique human models of AL that merit future  investigations in the field of developmental psychopathology. A complimenting  transdisciplinary perspective is applied throughout, whereby we argue that the  AL model goes beyond traditional stress-disease theories toward the advancement  of person-centered research and practice that promote not only physical health  but also mental health.

Perceived discrimination, serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region  status, and the development of conduct problems.	Brody GH(1), Beach SR, Chen YF, Obasi E, Philibert RA, Kogan SM, Simons RL.	Author information: (1)Center for Family Research, University of Georgia, 1095 College Station Road,  Athens, GA 30605-4527, USA. gbrody@uga.edu	This study examined the prospective relations of adolescents' perceptions of  discrimination and their genetic status with increases in conduct problems.  Participants were 461 African American youths residing in rural Georgia (Wave 1  mean age = 15.5 years) who provided three waves of data and a saliva sample from  which a polymorphism in the SCL6A4 (serotonin transporter [5-HTT]) gene  polymorphism known as the 5-HTT linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) was genotyped.  Data analyses using growth curve modeling indicated that perceived  discrimination was significantly related to the slope of conduct problems. As  hypothesized, interactions between perceived discrimination and genetic status  emerged for male but not female youths. Compared with those carrying two copies  of the long allele variant of 5-HTTLPR, male youths carrying one or two copies  of its short allele variant evinced higher rates of conduct problems over time  when they perceived high levels of racial discrimination. These findings are  consistent with resilience and differential susceptibility propositions stating  that genes can both foster sensitivity to adverse events and confer protection  from those events.

Nissa_Towe-Goodman@unc.edu	The current study explored longitudinal associations between interparental  aggression, the development of child attention skills, and early childhood  behavior problems in a diverse sample of 636 families living in predominately  low-income, nonmetropolitan communities. The results of latent-variable,  cross-lagged longitudinal models revealed that maternal-reported interparental  aggression in infancy predicted reduced observed attention skills in  toddlerhood; no association was observed, however, between attention in infancy  and interparental aggression during the toddler years. Further, reduced toddler  attention and high interparental aggression were both associated with increased  risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms and conduct problems  at 3 years of age. Processes largely operated in similar ways regardless of  child gender or low-income status, although a few differences were observed.  Overall, the results suggest that interparental aggression undermines attention  development, putting children's early behavioral adjustment at risk.

Pratchett LC(1), Yehuda R.	Author information: (1)James J. Peters Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Bronx, NY 10468, USA.  laura.pratchett@va.gov	The effects of childhood abuse are diverse, and although pathology is not the  only outcome, psychiatric illness, including posttraumatic stress disorder  (PTSD), can develop. However, adult PTSD is less common among those who  experienced single-event traumas as children than it is among those who  experienced childhood abuse. In addition, PTSD is more common among adults than  children who experienced childhood abuse. Such evidence raises doubt about the  direct, causal link between childhood trauma and adult PTSD. The experience of  childhood trauma, and in particular abuse, has been identified as a risk factor  for subsequent development of PTSD following exposure to adult trauma, and a  substantial literature identifies revictimization as a factor that plays a  pivotal role in this trajectory. The literature on the developmental effects of  childhood abuse and pathways to revictimization, when considered in tandem with  the biological effects of early stress in animal models, may provide some  explanations for this. Specifically, it seems possible that permanent  sensitization of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and behavioral outcomes  are a consequence of childhood abuse, and these combine with the impact of  retraumatization to sustain, perpetuate, and amplify symptomatology of those  exposed to maltreatment in childhood.

Westen D(1), Betan E, Defife JA.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Psychiatry, Emory University, 36 Eagle Row,  Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. dwesten@emory.edu	Although establishing a coherent identity is often viewed as a normative  developmental task of adolescence, an important question is whether forms of  identity disturbance seen in adult personality disorders can also be  distinguished in adolescents. If so, such disturbances would constitute an  essential target for research and clinical interventions. The goal of this study  is to investigate the nature of identity disturbance in an adolescent clinical  sample and to explore its links with personality pathology, particularly  borderline personality disorder. A national random sample of 139 psychiatrists  and clinical psychologists completed a battery of instruments on a randomly  selected adolescent patient in their care, including measures of Axis II  symptoms and the Identity Disturbance Questionnaire-Adolescent Version, an  instrument designed for clinically experienced observers that assesses a wide  range of manifestations of potential identity disturbance among adolescents.  Factor analysis of the Identity Disturbance Questionnaire--Adolescent Version  yielded four clinically and conceptually coherent factors that resembled  dimensions previously identified in adults: lack of normative commitment, role  absorption, painful incoherence, and lack of consistency. As in adults, identity  disturbance in adolescents is a clinically meaningful, multidimensional  construct exhibiting significant relationships with different forms of severe  personality pathology, most notably borderline personality disorder. As such,  identity disturbance can be a manifestation of psychopathology above and beyond  the typical Sturm und Drang (storm and stress) of adolescence.

Author information: (1)Departmentof Psychology, Université du Qébec à Montréal, C.P. 8888,  Succursale Centreville, Montreal QC H3C3P8, Canada. moss.ellen@uqam.ca	The efficacy of a short-term attachment-based intervention for changing risk  outcomes for children of maltreating families was examined using a randomized  control trial. Sixty-seven primary caregivers reported for maltreatment and  their children (1-5 years) were randomly assigned to an intervention or control  group. The intervention group received 8 weekly home visits directed at the  caregiver-child dyad and focused on improving caregiver sensitivity.  Intervention sessions included brief discussions of attachment-emotion  regulation-related themes and video feedback of parent-child interaction.  Comparison of pre- and posttest scores revealed significant improvements for the  intervention group in parental sensitivity and child attachment security, and a  reduction in child disorganization. Older children in the intervention group  also showed lower levels of internalizing and externalizing problems following  intervention. This is the first study to demonstrate the efficacy of short-term  attachment-based intervention in enhancing parental sensitivity, improving child  security, and reducing disorganization for children in the early childhood  period.

Assessments of infant temperament, quality of early parenting  interactions, contextual variables, and toddler effortful control and behavior  problems were conducted. Results supported differential susceptibility and dual  risk models in addition to documenting main effects of early parenting on  children's emerging self-regulation. Our data suggested that preterm or low  birth weight infants who were prone to distress or rated by mothers as more  difficult were particularly susceptible to the effects of early negative  parenting.

Hippocampal volume and sensitivity to maternal aggressive behavior: a  prospective study of adolescent depressive symptoms.	Whittle S(1), Yap MB, Sheeber L, Dudgeon P, Yücel M, Pantelis C, Simmons JG,  Allen NB.	Author information: (1)University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.	It has been suggested that biological factors confer increased sensitivity to  environmental influences on depressive symptoms during adolescence, a crucial  time for the onset of depressive disorders. Given the critical role of the  hippocampus in sensitivity to stress and processing of contextual aspects of the  environment, investigation of its role in determining sensitivity to  environmental context seems warranted. This study prospectively examined  hippocampal volume as a measure of sensitivity to the influence of aggressive  maternal behavior on change in depressive symptoms from early to midadolescence.  The interaction between aggressive maternal behavior and hippocampal volume was  found to predict change in depressive symptoms. Significant sex differences also  emerged, whereby only for girls were larger bilateral hippocampal volumes more  sensitive to the effects of maternal aggressive behavior, particularly with  respect to experiencing the protective effects of low levels of maternal  aggressiveness. These findings help elucidate the complex relationships between  brain structure, environmental factors such as maternal parenting style, and  sensitivity to (i.e., risk for, and protection from) the emergence of depression  during this life stage. Given that family context risk factors are modifiable,  our findings suggest the potential utility of targeted parenting interventions  for the prevention and treatment of adolescent depressive disorder.

Heritability of children's prosocial behavior and differential susceptibility to  parenting by variation in the dopamine receptor D4 gene.	Knafo A(1), Israel S, Ebstein RP.	Author information: (1)Psychology Department, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mount Scopus,  Jerusalem 91905, Israel. msarielk@mscc.huji.ac.il	Theoretical considerations and new empirical evidence suggest that children's  development cannot simply be explained by either genes or environment but that  their interaction is important to understanding child behavior. In particular, a  genetic polymorphism, the exon III repeat region of the dopamine receptor D4,  has been the focus of interest regarding differential susceptibility to parental  influence. To study environmental and genetic influences on children's prosocial  behavior, 168 twin pairs (mean age = 44 months) participated in an experiment  that assessed prosocial behavior via three measures: compliant prosocial  behavior elicited in response to social requests, self-initiated prosocial  behavior enacted voluntarily, and mothers' rating of children's behavior.  Genetic effects accounted for 34% to 53% of the variance in prosocial behavior.  The rest of the variance was accounted for by nonshared environment and error.  Parenting measures of maternal positivity, negativity, and unexplained  punishment did not correlate significantly with children's prosocial behavior.  However, when parenting was stratified by presence or absence of the child's  dopamine receptor D4 7-repeat allele in an overlapping sample of 167 children to  model differential susceptibility to parental influence, a richer picture  emerged. Positive parenting related meaningfully to mother-rated prosocial  behavior, and unexplained punishment related positively to self-initiated  prosocial behavior, but only among children carrying the 7-repeat allele. The  findings demonstrate that a molecular genetic strategy, based on genotyping of  common polymorphisms and combined with a classic twin approach, provides a  richer description of how genes and environment interact to shape children's  behavior, and allows for the identification of differential sensitivity to  parental influence.

Staff J(1), Schulenberg JE, Maslowsky J, Bachman JG, O'Malley PM, Maggs JL,  Johnston LD.	Author information: (1)Department of Sociology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA  16802-6207, USA. jus25@psu.edu	Substance use changes rapidly during late adolescence and early adulthood. This  time in the life course is also dense with social role changes, as role changes  provide dynamic context for individual developmental change. Using nationally  representative, multiwave longitudinal data from age 18 to 28, we examine  proximal links between changes in social roles and changes in substance use  during the transition to adulthood. We find that changes in family roles, such  as marriage, divorce, and parenthood, have clear and consistent associations  with changes in substance use. With some notable exceptions, changes in school  and work roles have weaker effects on changes in substance use compared to  family roles. Changes in socializing (i.e., nights out for fun and recreation)  and in religiosity were found to mediate the relationship of social role  transitions to substance use. Two time-invariant covariates, socioeconomic  background and heavy adolescent substance use, predicted social role status, but  did not moderate associations, as within-person links between social roles and  substance use were largely equivalent across groups. This paper adds to the  cascading effects literature by considering how, within individuals, more  proximal variations in school, work, and family roles relate to variations in  substance use, and which roles appear to be most influential in precipitating  changes in substance use during the transition to adulthood.

Developmental cascades: linking adolescent substance use, affiliation with  substance use promoting peers, and academic achievement to adult substance use  disorders.	Haller M(1), Handley E, Chassin L, Bountress K.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, 950 South McAllister,  Tempe, AZ 85287-1104, USA. moira.haller@asu.edu	Using a high-risk community sample (N = 405), the current study examined  developmental cascades among substance use, affiliation with substance use  promoting peers, and academic achievement over an 18-year period and tested  whether these pathways mediated the influence of parental alcoholism on adult  alcohol and drug use disorders. Results showed that the influence of parental  alcoholism on adult drug disorders was mediated by developmental cascades across  all three domains, whereas the influence of parental alcoholism on adult alcohol  disorders was mediated through affiliation with substance use promoting peers  and persistence in binge drinking. Adolescent drug use had more implications for  adult outcomes than did adolescent alcohol use, which was less likely to spill  over into other domains of functioning. Findings indicated that adolescent risk  factors had indirect rather than unique effects on adult substance use  disorders, suggesting that adolescent risk is not immutable and is largely  mediated by later influences.

Continuity and cascade in offspring of bipolar parents: a longitudinal study of  externalizing, internalizing, and thought problems.	Klimes-Dougan B(1), Long JD, Lee CY, Ronsaville DS, Gold PW, Martinez PE.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, 75 West River Road,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. klimes@umn.edu	There is growing evidence that many offspring of bipolar parents will develop  moderate to severe forms of psychopathology during childhood and adolescence.  The purpose of this study was to apply growth curve models to evaluate  developmental progression with regard to continuity and cascades representative  within the context of a family risk study of bipolar disorder (BD). Repeated  assessments of externalizing, internalizing, and thought problems, spanning more  than a decade, were examined in a total of 94 offspring of parents with BD  (O-BD), major depressive disorder (O-UNI), or no significant psychiatric or  medical problems (O-WELL). Continuity was defined by the growth curve of the  O-WELL group who exhibited low levels of problems from early childhood through  late adolescence. Discontinuity, as evidenced by greater complexity of growth  curves relative to the O-WELL group, was exhibited in the at- risk offspring  groups for internalizing problems. Different patterns of developmental cascades  were supported for the at-risk group with O-UNI showing a robust cascade from  self-regulatory deficits (externalizing problems) to internalizing problems.  There was also support for a cascade from self-regulatory deficits to thought  problems across the entire group (with some support that this pattern was  accounted for primarily by O-BD). This study not only serves to advance our  understanding of the risks associated with a family history of BD, but also  provides a novel approach to examining developmental cascades.

Garber J(1), Cole DA.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, 230 Appleton Place, Vanderbilt University,  Nashville, TN 37203-5721, USA. judy.garber@vanderbilt.edu	The present study tested a "launch-and-grow" type of cascade model in which an  earlier risk factor (e.g., exposure to maternal depression by age 12) was  hypothesized to predict several risk processes during development (e.g., stress,  family relationships, self-worth [SW]), which then set the course for the growth  of children's depressive symptoms over time. Participants were 240 mothers and  children (mean age = 11.87 years, SD = 0.57) who were evaluated annually across  6 years. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM diagnoses was used to assess  mothers' psychiatric history; 185 mothers had had a mood disorder and 55 mothers  were lifetime free of psychiatric diagnoses. At each assessment, mothers  completed measures of their current level of depressive symptoms and stressful  life events; adolescents completed measures about their perceptions of the  family environment and their SW; and clinicians rated adolescents' level of  depressive symptoms based on separate interviews with the adolescent and mother.  Latent growth curve analyses revealed that history of maternal depression  significantly predicted the intercepts of the growth trajectories of  adolescents' depressive symptoms, mothers' current depressive symptoms,  stressful life events, family environment, and adolescents' SW. The intercepts  of each of these variables then predicted the trajectory (i.e., slope) of the  growth of adolescents' depressive symptoms across the 6 years of the study.  These results were consistent with the hypothesized model of maternal depression  launching a set of risk factors, which in turn predict the growth of depressive  symptoms during adolescence. Implications for interventions aimed at preventing  depression in at-risk youth are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000489 PMID: 20883584 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Influence of parental depressive symptoms on adopted toddler behaviors: an  emerging developmental cascade of genetic and environmental effects.	Pemberton CK(1), Neiderhiser JM, Leve LD, Natsuaki MN, Shaw DS, Reiss D, Ge X.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA  16801, USA. pemberton@psu.edu	This study examined the developmental cascade of both genetic and environmental  influences on toddlers' behavior problems through the longitudinal and  multigenerational assessment of psychosocial risk. We used data from the Early  Growth and Development Study, a prospective adoption study, to test the  intergenerational transmission of risk through the assessment of adoptive  mother, adoptive father, and biological parent depressive symptoms on toddler  behavior problems. Given that depression is often chronic, we control for  across-time continuity and find that in addition to associations between  adoptive mother depressive symptoms and toddler externalizing problems, adoptive  father depressive symptoms when the child is 9 months of age were associated  with toddler problems and associated with maternal depressive symptoms. Findings  also indicated that a genetic effect may indirectly influence toddler problems  through prenatal pregnancy risk. These findings help to describe how multiple  generations are linked through genetic (biological parent), timing  (developmental age of the child), and contextual (marital partner) pathways.

We examined the developmental processes involved in peer problems among children  (M age = 10.41 years) previously diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder (ADHD) at study entry (N = 536) and a comparison group (N = 284).  Participants were followed over a 6-year period ranging from middle childhood to  adolescence. At four assessment periods, measures of aggression, social skills,  positive illusory biases (in the social and behavioral domains), and peer  rejection were assessed. Results indicated that children from the ADHD group  exhibited difficulties in each of these areas at the first assessment. Moreover,  there were vicious cycles among problems over time. For example, peer rejection  was related to impaired social skills, which in turn predicted later peer  rejection. Problems also tended to spill over into other areas, which in turn  compromised functioning in additional areas across development, leading to  cascading effects over time. The findings held even when controlling for age and  were similar for males and females, the ADHD and comparison groups, and among  ADHD treatment groups. The results suggest that the peer problems among children  with and without ADHD may reflect similar processes; however, children with ADHD  exhibit greater difficulties negotiating important developmental tasks.  Implications for interventions are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000465 PMCID: PMC3058512 PMID: 20883582 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Lewin-Bizan S(1), Bowers EP, Lerner RM.	Author information: (1)Applied Research in Youth Development, Tufts University, Medford, MA 02155,  USA.	Developmental cascades are links across the life span among heterotypic  (qualitatively distinct) variables associated with one or more levels of  organization within the ecology of human development. Using data from the  longitudinal, 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development (PYD), we illustrate a  developmental systems theory predicated model of cascades in the relations  between individuals and contexts that promote positive development among  adolescents. Consistent with expectations about the bases of PYD and the role in  such development on person and context, ecological resources associated with  parenting are linked to individual self-regulatory behaviors that in turn impact  PYD, which is then associated with youth community contributions. We discuss the  limitations and future directions of this research and the implications of  developmental cascades for applications to policies and programs.

Author information: (1)Research Group, Department of Human & Community Development, University of  California, Davis, 202 Cousteau Place, Suite 100, Davis, CA 95616, USA.  monmartin@ucdavis.edu	The current multigenerational study evaluates the utility of the interactionist  model of socioeconomic influence on human development (IMSI) in explaining  problem behaviors across generations. The IMSI proposes that the association  between socioeconomic status (SES) and human development involves a dynamic  interplay that includes both social causation (SES influences human development)  and social selection (individual characteristics affect SES). As part of the  developmental cascade proposed by the IMSI, the findings from this investigation  showed that Generation 1 (G1) adolescent problem behavior predicted later G1  SES, family stress, and parental emotional investments, as well as the next  generation of children's problem behavior. These results are consistent with a  social selection view. Consistent with the social causation perspective, we  found a significant relation between G1 SES and family stress, and in turn,  family stress predicted Generation 2 (G2) problem behavior. Finally, G1 adult  SES predicted both material and emotional investments in the G2 child. In turn,  emotional investments predicted G2 problem behavior, as did material  investments. Some of the predicted pathways varied by G1 parent gender. The  results are consistent with the view that processes of both social selection and  social causation account for the association between SES and human development.

Chen X(1), Huang X, Chang L, Wang L, Li D.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 5C2  Canada. xchen@uwo.ca	The primary purpose of this longitudinal study was to examine, in a sample of  Chinese children (initial M age = 8 years, N = 1,140), contributions of  aggression to the development of social competence and academic achievement.  Five waves of panel data on aggression and social and school performance were  collected from peer evaluations, teacher ratings, and school records in Grades 2  to 5. Structural equation modeling revealed that aggression had unique effects  on later social competence and academic achievement after their stabilities were  controlled, particularly in the junior grades. Aggression also had significant  indirect effects on social and academic outcomes through multiple pathways.  Social competence and academic achievement contributed to the development of  each other, but not aggression. The results indicate cascade effects of  aggression in Chinese children from a developmental perspective.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579410000295 PMID: 20576180 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, John Dewey Hall Room 340, University of Vermont, 2  Colchester Avenue, Burlington, VT 05405-0134, USA. keith.burt@uvm.edu	Existing longitudinal research on the interplay between externalizing problems,  internalizing problems, and academic and social competence has documented  "cascading" effects from early aggressive/disruptive behavior through  impairments in competence, leading to symptoms of depression and anxiety. The  primary aim of the current study was to replicate such work using the NICHD  Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development while also extending the  developmental window of investigation of cascades back into early childhood.  Participating families (N = 1,160) completed questionnaire measures of  externalizing, internalizing, and social competence (maternal report), as well  as individual assessment of academic achievement, spanning five time points from  age 54 months through age 15 years. A series of nested structural equation  models tested predicted links across various domains of competence and  psychopathology. Results were consistent with prior research, demonstrating  cross-domain effects from early externalizing problems through effects on both  academic and social competence into later internalizing problems. Effects held  across gender and were largely unaffected by inclusion of socioeconomic status,  early caregiving, and early cognitive ability as covariates in the model.

Past research demonstrates the significance of community,  family, and child psychological processes in child adjustment, supporting study  of interrelations between multiple social ecological factors and child  adjustment in contexts of political violence. Testing a social ecological model,  300 mothers and their children (M = 12.28 years, SD = 1.77) from Catholic and  Protestant working class neighborhoods in Belfast, Northern Ireland, completed  measures of community discord, family relations, and children's regulatory  processes (i.e., emotional security) and outcomes. Historical political violence  in neighborhoods based on objective records (i.e., politically motivated deaths)  were related to family members' reports of current sectarian antisocial behavior  and nonsectarian antisocial behavior. Interparental conflict and parental  monitoring and children's emotional security about both the community and family  contributed to explanatory pathways for relations between sectarian antisocial  behavior in communities and children's adjustment problems. The discussion  evaluates support for social ecological models for relations between political  violence and child adjustment and its implications for understanding relations  in other parts of the world.

Frontolimbic activity in a frustrating task: covariation between patterns of  coping and individual differences in externalizing and internalizing symptoms.	Moadab I(1), Gilbert T, Dishion TJ, Tucker DM.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, 1227, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA.  imoadab@uoregon.edu	Many problem behaviors in youth have been attributed to maladaptive  self-regulation in response to frustration. Frontolimbic networks that promote  flexible as well as over- and undercontrolled regulation could provide evidence  linking cortical mechanisms of self-regulation to the development of  internalizing or externalizing symptomology. Specifically, ineffective dorsally  mediated inhibitory control may be associated with rule-breaking and substance  use behaviors, whereas overengagement of ventral limbic systems responsible for  self-monitoring of errors may increase risk of developing anxious and depressed  symptomology. In this study, a sample of 9- to 13-year-old children were  presented with an emotional go/no-go task. Event-related potentials were used to  identify differences in cortical mechanisms related to inhibitory control  (indexed with the stimulus-locked medial frontal negativity) and self-monitoring  (indexed with the error-related negativity). These measurements were then  related to externalizing and internalizing behaviors. As predicted,  externalizing problems were associated with smaller medial frontal negativity  amplitudes, which indicate undercontrolled self-regulation and poor dorsal  mediation of actions. Internalizing symptoms were related to larger  error-related negativity amplitudes, demonstrating overregulation and  overengagement of ventral limbic systems. These findings suggest that the use of  event-related potential methodology with paradigms that elicit cognition-emotion  can provide insight into the neural mechanisms of regulatory deficits that  result in problem behaviors in youth.

The dynamic association between biased  self-perceptions and dimensional indices of depressive symptoms and aggression  also were considered. Across the 6-year time span, comparison children exhibited  less bias than children with ADHD, although a normative bolstering of social  self-views during early adolescence was observed. Decreases in positive biases  regarding social and behavioral competence were associated with increases in  depressive symptoms over time, whereas increases in levels of positively biased  self-perceptions in the behavioral (but not social) domain were predictive of  greater aggression over time. ADHD status moderated the dynamic association  between biases and adjustment. Finally, evidence indicated that there was a  bidirectional relationship between biases and aggression, whereas depressive  symptoms appeared to inversely predict later bias.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Kent State University, Kent, OH 44242, USA.  lbrumar1@kent.edu	The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the theory and evidence for the links  of parent-child attachment with internalizing problems in childhood and  adolescence. We address three key questions: (a) how consistent is the evidence  that attachment security or insecurity is linked to internalizing symptoms,  anxiety, and depression? (b) How consistent is the evidence that specific forms  of insecurity are more strongly related to internalizing symptoms, anxiety, and  depression than are other forms of insecurity? (c) Are associations with  internalizing symptoms, anxiety, and depression consistent for mother-child and  father-child attachment? The current findings are consistent with the hypothesis  that insecure attachment is associated with the development of internalizing  problems. The links between specific insecure attachment patterns and  internalizing problems are difficult to evaluate. Father-child and mother-child  attachments have a comparable impact, although there are relatively few studies  of father-child attachment. No moderators consistently affect these relations.  We also propose two models of how attachment insecurity may combine with other  factors to lead to anxiety or depression.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409990344 PMID: 20102655 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Oosterman M(1), De Schipper JC, Fisher P, Dozier M, Schuengel C.	Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Child and Family Studies, VU University Amsterdam,  Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.oosterman@psy.vu.nl	This study examined whether the quality of relationships with foster caregivers  was associated with autonomic nervous system reactivity of children during  separation and reunion with their foster caregiver. Moreover, effects of early  adversity were examined in relation to attachment and autonomic nervous system  reactivity. The sample included 60 children between 26 and 88 months of age, who  participated with their primary foster caregivers in the Strange Situation.  Respiratory sinus arrhythmia and preejection period were measured as indicators  of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system reactivity, respectively.  Attachment quality (ordered/disordered and secure/insecure attachment), was  coded on the basis of children's behavior in the Strange Situation using the  Cassidy and Marvin coding system. Children with a background of neglect and  those with disordered (disorganized-controlling or insecure-other) attachment  showed most sympathetic reactivity during the procedure. Moreover, children with  disordered attachment showed less vagal regulation (respiratory sinus arrhythmia  decreases on separation and increases on reunion) than children with ordered  attachment. The findings show that the quality of relationships with current  caregivers, and to a lesser extent specific experiences of neglect, may have an  impact on children's abilities to regulate emotions in the context of  environmental stress and challenges.

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, 51 East River Road,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. carls032@umn.edu	The antecedents and developmental course of borderline personality disorder  symptoms were examined prospectively from infancy to adulthood using  longitudinal data from a risk sample (N = 162). Borderline personality disorder  symptom counts were derived from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM  Disorders diagnostic interview at age 28 years. Correlational analyses confirmed  expected relations between borderline symptoms and contemporary adult  disturbance (e.g., self-injurious behavior, dissociative symptoms, drug use,  relational violence) as well as maltreatment history. Antecedent correlational  and regression analyses revealed significant links between borderline symptoms  in adulthood and endogenous (i.e., temperament) and environmental (e.g.,  attachment disorganization, parental hostility) history in early childhood and  disturbance across domains of child functioning (e.g., attention, emotion,  behavior, relationship, self-representation) in middle childhood/early  adolescence. Process analyses revealed a significant mediating effect of  self-representation on the relation between attachment disorganization on  borderline symptoms. The findings are discussed within a developmental  psychopathology framework in which disturbance in self-processes is constructed  through successive transactions between the individual and environment.

Cole PM(1), Llera SJ, Pemberton CK.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA  16802-3106, USA. pmc5@psu.edu	Emotional instability and poor emotional awareness are cardinal features of the  emotional dysregulation associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD).  Most models of the development of BPD include child negative emotional  reactivity and grossly inadequate caregiving (e.g., abuse, emotional  invalidation) as major contributing factors. However, early childhood emotional  reactivity and exposure to adverse family situations are associated with a  diverse range of long-term outcomes. We examine the known effects of these risk  factors on early childhood emotional functioning and their potential links to  the emergence of chronic emotional instability and poor emotional awareness.  This examination leads us to advocate new research directions. First, we  advocate for enriching the developmental assessment of children's emotional  functioning to more closely capture clinically relevant aspects. Second, we  advocate for conceptualizing children's early family experiences in terms of the  proximal emotional environment to which young children may be or become  sensitive. Such approaches should contribute to our ability to identify risk for  BPD and guide preventive intervention.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579409990162 PMID: 19825269 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Using a short form of the CPS and mixed models  incorporating fixed and random effects, we examined the reliability, individual  stability, mean-level stability, and predictive utility of juvenile psychopathy  as a function of age (i.e., from 7 to 17 years old) in over 1,500 boys from the  three cohorts of the Pittsburgh Youth Study. If adolescent development  contributes to instability in personality pathology, large age-related  fluctuations in reliability, stability, and predictive utility should be  observed, particularly in the latter part of adolescence when normative changes  are hypothesized to influence levels of psychopathy. Such fluctuations were not  observed. In general, juvenile psychopathy could be reliably assessed beginning  in childhood, was fairly stable across short and long intervals, showed little  mean-level fluctuation, and predicted delinquency across adolescence. These  results suggest that concerns about large changes in personality pathology  across childhood and adolescence may be overstated. Implications and future  directions are discussed.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Maine, Orono, ME 04469, USA.  peter.lafreniere@umit.maine.edu	A developmental-evolutionary perspective is used to synthesize basic research  from the neurosciences, ethology, genetics, and developmental psychology into a  unified framework for understanding the nature and origins of social anxiety and  avoidant personality disorder. Evidence is presented that social anxiety  disorder (social phobia) and avoidant personality disorder may be alternate  conceptualizations of the same disorder because they have virtually the same  symptoms and genetic basis, and respond to the same pharmacologic and  psychotherapeutic interventions. A functionalist perspective on social anxiety  is formulated to (a) explain the origins of normative states of anxiety, (b)  outline developmental pathways in the transition from normative anxiety to  social anxiety and avoidant personality disorders, and (c) account for the  processes leading to gender-differentiated patterns of anxiety-related disorders  after puberty.

Crawford TN(1), Cohen PR, Chen H, Anglin DM, Ehrensaft M.	Author information: (1)Children in the Community Study, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New  York, NY 10032, USA. crawfor@pi.cpmc.columbia.edu	Extended maternal separations before age 5 were evaluated as a predictor of  long-term risk for offspring borderline personality disorder (BPD) symptoms in  longitudinal data from a large random community sample. Early separations from  mother predicted elevations in BPD symptoms assessed repeatedly from early  adolescence to middle adulthood. Early separations also predicted a slower than  normal rate of decline in symptoms with age. Other theoretically grounded risks  were examined and shown to predict elevated BPD symptoms over the developmental  trajectory. Long-term effects of early separations were largely independent of  childhood temperament, child abuse, maternal problems, and parenting risks.  These data provide the first prospectively collected data on the developmental  course of BPD symptoms and suggest a series of environmental and other  influences on these very disabling problems.

Neighborhoods and genes and everything in between: understanding adolescent  aggression in social and biological contexts.	Hart D(1), Marmorstein NR.	Author information: (1)Rutgers University, USA. daniel.hart@rutgers.edu	Adolescent aggression was explored in relation to neighborhood and genetic  characteristics. Child saturation (the proportion of the population consisting  of children under the age of 15), ethnic heterogeneity, poverty, and urbanicity  of neighborhoods were examined in relation to adolescent aggression in 12,098  adolescents followed longitudinally for 1 year. Longitudinal analyses indicated  that child saturation was positively associated with increases in aggression,  with this finding emerging among those living in the same neighborhood at both  testing times and those who moved between testing times. In a subsample of males  for whom genetic data were available, the relation of child saturation to  adolescent aggression was moderated by the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene. The  regression of aggression on child saturation was steeper for those with the low  activity version of the MAOA allele than among those with the high activity  version of the allele. The implications of the results for an understanding of  the origins and ontogeny of aggression and personality disorders are discussed.

Multifinality in the development of personality disorders: a Biology x Sex x  Environment interaction model of antisocial and borderline traits.	Beauchaine TP(1), Klein DN, Crowell SE, Derbidge C, Gatzke-Kopp L.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-1525,  USA. tbeaucha@u.washington.edu	Although antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is more common among males and  borderline PD (BPD) is more common among females, some authors have suggested  that the two disorders reflect multifinal outcomes of a single etiology. This  assertion is based on several overlapping symptoms and features, including trait  impulsivity, emotional lability, high rates of depression and suicide, and a  high likelihood of childhood abuse and/or neglect. Furthermore, rates of ASPD  are elevated in the first degree relatives of those with BPD, and concurrent  comorbidity rates for the two disorders are high. In this article, we present a  common model of antisocial and borderline personality development. We begin by  reviewing issues and problems with diagnosing and studying PDs in children and  adolescents. Next, we discuss dopaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms of trait  impulsivity as predisposing vulnerabilities to ASPD and BPD. Finally, we extend  shared risk models for ASPD and BPD by specifying genetic loci that may confer  differential vulnerability to impulsive aggression and mood dysregulation among  males and impulsive self-injury and mood dysregulation among females. Although  the precise mechanisms of these sex-moderated genetic vulnerabilities remain  poorly understood, they appear to interact with environmental risk factors  including adverse rearing environments to potentiate the development of ASPD and  BPD.

The impact of parenthood on alcohol consumption trajectories: variations as a  function of timing of parenthood, familial alcoholism, and gender.	Little M(1), Handley E, Leuthe E, Chassin L.	Author information: (1)Psychology Department, University of Texas at San Antonio, One UTSA Circle,  San Antonio, TX 78249-0652, USA. Michelle.Little@utsa.edu	The current study tested the impact of the transition to parenthood on growth in  alcohol consumption from early adolescence through emerging adulthood. We  measured age-related discontinuity in trajectories of alcohol consumption  associated with timing of the parenthood transition, above and beyond the  effects of accrued educational status, gender, and time-varying marital status.  We also examined the impact of a familial selection factor for the transmission  of alcohol use problems, family history density of alcoholism (FHD), on both  risk for adolescent parenthood and risk for adolescent parents' continuity in  alcohol consumption after the parent transition within a mediation structural  equation model. Premature timing of parenthood had a distinct effect on emerging  adult alcohol trajectories. Although participants who became parents as emerging  adults showed role-related decline in alcohol consumption, those who became  parents during adolescence showed a role-related rise in emerging adult alcohol  consumption. Gender moderated adolescent parents' role-related growth in  emerging adult alcohol consumption. Adolescent fathers showed an adverse rise in  alcohol consumption after becoming parents, whereas adolescent mothers' alcohol  consumption did not change significantly. FHD was related to high adolescent  alcohol consumption, which mediated risk for the incidence of early parenthood.  Finally, the adverse effect of FHD on trajectories of emerging adult alcohol use  was mediated by a dual pathway: (a) developmental continuity of conduct problems  and (b) early transition to parenthood.

Ge X(1), Natsuaki MN, Neiderhiser JM, Reiss D.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, 51 East River Road,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. gexj@umn.edu	This study investigated the prospective links of negative life events and  parent-child closeness with depressive symptoms among siblings using a  multilevel modeling approach with a genetically informative design. The sample  consisted of 756 adolescents (378 sibling pairs) who participated in two waves  of the Nonshared Environment in Adolescent Development Project. Sibling pairs  with varying degree of genetic relatedness (i.e., monozygotic, dizygotic, full  siblings, half siblings, and genetically unrelated siblings) were included. The  results showed that negative life events, both personal and family life events,  and parent-child closeness at Time 1 were significantly associated with  depressive symptoms at Time 2 after accounting for the intrapair correlations  between siblings. The effects remained significant after controlling for the  levels of preexisting depressive symptoms. More importantly, closeness with  mothers, but not with fathers, moderated the effects of both personal and family  negative life events on subsequent depressive symptoms.

Conley CS(1), Rudolph KD.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Loyola University Chicago, 6525 N. Sheridan Road,  Chicago, IL 60626, USA. cconley@luc.edu	This research investigated the developmental stages (pubertal status) and  contexts (early or late timing relative to peers, and a context of stressful  versus supportive peer relationships) in which the sex difference in depression  unfolds. A sample of 158 youth (ages 9.6-14.8) and their caregivers provided  information at two waves, 1 year apart, on puberty, peer stress, and depression.  Pubertal status and timing (actual and perceived) interacted with sex to predict  depression. Sex differences in depression were evident at particular levels of  pubertal status and timing, both actual and perceived. Depression was associated  with more mature pubertal status and early timing (both actual and perceived) in  girls, but with less mature pubertal status and late timing (actual and  perceived) in boys. These patterns held concurrently, and often over time,  particularly in a context of stressful peer relationships (peer stress moderated  sex-differentiated associations between puberty and depression). Of note, there  were no significant sex differences in depression at any particular age. Thus,  this research highlights important distinctions among the contributions of age,  pubertal status, pubertal timing, and perceived timing to the sex difference in  adolescent depression. More broadly, these findings contribute to our growing  understanding of the interactions among physical, social, and psychological  processes involved in the sex difference in adolescent depression.

Maternal depressive symptoms in infancy: unique contribution to children's  depressive symptoms in childhood and adolescence?	Bureau JF(1), Easterbrooks MA, Lyons-Ruth K.	Author information: (1)Harvard Medical School, USA. jbureau@uottawa.ca	This prospective 20-year study assessed associations between maternal depressive  symptoms in infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and child and adolescent  depressive symptoms in a sample of families at high psychosocial risk. Maternal  symptomatology was assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies  Depression Scale (CES-D) when children were infants (12 months), school-aged  (age 8), and adolescents (age 19). Children's depressive symptoms were measured  at age 8 (Dimensions of Depression Profile for Children and Adolescents) and age  19 (CES-D). Maternal depressive symptoms during infancy contributed to the  prediction of child depressive symptoms at age 8, after controlling for  concurrent maternal depressive symptoms, clinical risk in infancy, and gender.  Clinical risk in infancy marginally contributed to the prediction model.  Disorganization of attachment in infancy and maternal hostility were independent  predictors of depressive symptoms at age 8 and did not mediate the relation  between maternal and child depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms in  adolescence were predicted by gender, children's depressive symptoms at age 8,  maternal depressive symptoms in adolescence, and maternal depressive symptoms in  infancy. There was no moderating effect of gender. Adding to previous evidence  on the importance of early maternal depression, maternal depressive symptoms  during infancy were related to the development of depressive symptoms in  childhood and adolescence even when other variables of potential relevance were  controlled.

Eisenberg N(1), Chang L, Ma Y, Huang X.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-1104,  USA. Nancy.Eisenberg@asu.edu	The purpose of the study was to examine the relations of authoritative parenting  and corporal punishment to Chinese first and second graders' effortful control  (EC), impulsivity, ego resilience, and maladjustment, as well as mediating  relations. A parent and teacher reported on children's EC, impulsivity, and ego  resilience; parents reported on children's internalizing symptoms and their own  parenting, and teachers and peers reported on children's externalizing symptoms.  Authoritative parenting and low corporal punishment predicted high EC, and EC  mediated the relation between parenting and externalizing problems. In addition,  impulsivity mediated the relation of corporal punishment to externalizing  problems. The relation of parenting to children's ego resilience was mediated by  EC and/or impulsivity, and ego resilience mediated the relations of EC and  impulsivity to internalizing problems.

Moderating effects of family environment on the association between children's  aggressive beliefs and their aggression trajectories from childhood to  adolescence.	Andreas JB(1), Watson MW.	Author information: (1)Warren Alpert Medical School, Department of Community Health, Center for  Population Health and Clinical Epidemiology, Brown University, 121 S. Main  Street, Providence, RI 02912, USA. jba@brown.edu	This study explored how children's aggressive beliefs and their family  environments combine to influence the development of child aggression from  middle childhood into adolescence. We utilized a "variable-centered" empirical  approach, specifically examining whether children's aggressive beliefs represent  a risk factor for their aggressive behaviors and whether this risk can be  moderated by children's family environment. These questions were tested with  individual growth modeling, using the data from a community-representative  sample of 440 mother-child dyads, interviewed four times over a 6-year study  period. The accelerated longitudinal design of the study enabled examination of  children's aggression trajectories from age 7 to age 19. The results supported  the hypothesis that elevated aggressive beliefs in children represent a risk  factor for aggression, as higher aggressive beliefs were associated with greater  aggression at the youngest age, as well as with increased aggression over time.  However, as hypothesized, family environment moderated this association, such  that changes in children's aggression over time were contingent upon the  interaction of their aggressive beliefs with family environment. Specifically,  aggression was reduced in children with high aggressive beliefs if they  experienced better than average family environment, which included less family  conflict and more family cohesion.

Atkinson L(1), Leung E, Goldberg S, Benoit D, Poulton L, Myhal N, Blokland K,  Kerr S.	Author information: (1)University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. atkinson@psych.ryerson.ca	Although central to attachment theory, internal working models remain a useful  heuristic in need of concretization. We compared the selective attention of  organized and disorganized mothers using the emotional Stroop task. Both  disorganized attachment and emotional Stroop response involve the coordination  of strongly conflicting motivations under conditions of emotional arousal.  Furthermore, much is known about the cognitive and neuromodulatory correlates of  the Stroop that may inform attempts to substantiate the internal working model  construct. We assessed 47 community mothers with the Adult Attachment Interview  and the Working Model of the Child Interview in the third trimester of  pregnancy. At 6 and 12 months postpartum, we assessed mothers with emotional  Stroop tasks involving neutral, attachment, and emotion conditions. At 12  months, we observed their infants in the Strange Situation. Results showed that:  disorganized attachment is related to relative Stroop reaction time, that is,  unlike organized mothers, disorganized mothers respond to negative  attachment/emotion stimuli more slowly than to neutral stimuli; relative speed  of response is positively related to number of times the dyad was classified  disorganized, and change in relative Stroop response time from 6 to 12 months is  related to the match-mismatch status of mother and infant attachment  classifications. We discuss implications in terms of automatic and controlled  processing and, more specifically, cognitive threat tags, parallel distributed  processing, and neuromodulation through norepinephrine and dopamine.

We examined puberty-specific effects on affect-related behavior and on the  psychophysiology of defensive and appetitive motivation while controlling for  age. Adolescents (N = 94, ages = 12 and 13 years) viewed 75 pictures  (International Affective Picture System: pleasant, neutral, and aversive) while  listening to auditory probes. Startle response and postauricular (PA) reflex  were collected as measures of defensive and appetitive motivation, respectively.  Pubertal status and measures of anxiety/stress reaction and sensation/thrill  seeking were obtained. Mid-/late pubertal adolescents showed enhanced startle  amplitude across all picture valences. A Puberty x Valence interaction revealed  that mid-/late pubertal adolescents showed appetitive potentiation of the PA,  whereas pre-/early pubertal adolescents showed no modulation of the PA reflex.  Mid-/late pubertal adolescents also scored significantly higher on measures of  sensation/thrill seeking than did their pre-/early pubertal peers and puberty  moderated the association between psychophysiology and behavioral measures,  suggesting that it plays a role in reorganizing defensive and appetitive  motivational systems.

Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques such as  functional magnetic resonance imaging, structural magnetic resonance imaging,  diffusion tensor imaging, and small animal imaging have advanced our ability to  investigate this hypothesis. Moreover, the power of longitudinal designs  possible with these noninvasive techniques enable the study of not just how  connectivity is disrupted in schizophrenia, but when this disruption emerges  during development. This article reviews genetic and neurodevelopmental  influences on structural and functional connectivity in human populations with  or at risk for schizophrenia and in animal models of the disorder. We conclude  that the weight of evidence across these diverse lines of inquiry points to a  developmental disruption of neural connectivity in schizophrenia and that this  disrupted connectivity likely involves susceptibility genes that affect  processes involved in establishing intra- and interregional connectivity.

Author information: (1)Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305, USA.	The amygdala has received great interest as a possible neurophysiological  substrate of bipolar disorder (BD). This review summarizes information about the  structure and function of the amygdala with attention to its role in experienced  emotion and mood. We review the evidence for amygdala pathology in psychiatric  conditions and discuss the role of the amygdala in BD during development. There  appear to be consistent findings in the neuroimaging literature that suggest an  etiological model for BD that involves abnormalities in the structure and  function of the amygdala, but also depends on the failure of prefrontal cortical  regions to modulate amygdala activity. In addition, evidence is accumulating to  suggest that this model has flexible outcomes, depending on factors intrinsic  and extrinsic to BD, and may follow several possible paths across the course of  maturational development.

S.Durston@umcutrecht.nl	This paper discusses how converging methods may form a powerful tool in  unraveling the neurobiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  Integrating findings from multiple disciplines can inform us on how different  neurobiological and cognitive mechanisms tie together in both typical and  atypical development. Examples are discussed of this approach: combining family  and genetic approaches with anatomical neuroimaging illustrates how mapping  familial effects can bring us closer to understanding the neurobiology of ADHD.  Functional neuroimaging has convincingly linked cognitive problems in this  disorder with frontostriatal functioning, but also shows that other systems may  be involved in some of the symptoms of ADHD. Combining these findings has  suggested new avenues for investigation, such as the role of frontocerebellar  networks. Furthermore, findings may have practical applications: this paper  discusses an example of how converging evidence of striatal dysregulation in  ADHD suggests possible directions for treatment that are now being explored in  functional imaging studies.

Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center, Eugene, OR 97401, USA. philf@oslc.org	Foster children exhibit high rates of atypical neuroendocrine functioning  compared to children in the general population. In particular, alterations in  the daytime diurnal activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis  have been observed in foster children, often characterized by blunted salivary  cortisol levels (i.e., low morning levels that remain low throughout the day).  There is emerging evidence that therapeutic interventions for foster children  can affect this pattern of HPA axis activity, but the specific intervention  components responsible for change have not been fully explicated. Within a  randomized trial to evaluate a therapeutic intervention for foster preschoolers  (n = 57 intervention condition; n = 60 comparison condition; n = 60 community  comparison condition), the present study examined whether diurnal cortisol  activity was associated with caregiver self-reported stress in response to child  problem behavior. Results showed immediate reductions in caregiver stress that  were sustained through 12 months postbaseline in the intervention condition. In  contrast, caregivers in the regular foster care condition showed higher rates of  stress across time and increased stress sensitivity to child problem behaviors.  In addition, among caregivers in regular foster care, higher self-reported  stress was associated with lower morning cortisol levels and more blunted  diurnal cortisol activity. These results provide evidence that interventions can  simultaneously impact caregiver stress and buffer children from the negative  impacts of caregiver stress on HPA axis regulation.

Incorporating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis measures into preventive  interventions for adolescent depression: are we there yet?	Adam EK(1), Sutton JM, Doane LD, Mineka S.	Author information: (1)Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA. ek-adam@northwestern.edu	Altered functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a robust  correlate of major depression in adults, and to a lesser extent, in adolescents.  Premorbid differences in HPA axis function have been found to prospectively  predict the onset of adolescent depression. To what extent might our knowledge  of HPA axis function in adolescents with, or at risk for, depression, help guide  efforts to prevent depression in this age group? We review evidence regarding  the role of the HPA axis in the development of adolescent depression, and  examine whether and which HPA axis measures might be useful in guiding  prevention efforts as (a) as a criterion by which to select youth at risk for  depression, (b) as a predictor of which youth will be most responsive to  prevention efforts, and (c) as an indicator of whether prevention/intervention  efforts are working. We conclude that our current understanding of the HPA axis,  and its measurement, in adolescent depression are not sufficiently precise to be  of immediate practical use in improving prevention efforts. Incorporating HPA  axis measures into prevention studies, however, would be immensely useful in  clarifying the role of the HPA axis in adolescent depression, such that future  prevention efforts might more confidently rely on HPA axis information.

Marshall PJ(1), Reeb BC, Fox NA, Nelson CA 3rd, Zeanah CH.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19122, USA.  pjmarsh@temple.edu	Two groups of Romanian children were compared on spectral power and coherence in  the electroencephalogram (EEG) in early childhood. One group consisted of  previously institutionalized children who had been randomly assigned to a foster  care intervention at a mean age of 23 months. The second group had been  randomized to remain in institutional care. Because of a policy of  noninterference, a number of these children also experienced placement into  alternative family care environments. There were minimal group differences  between the foster care and institutionalized groups in EEG power and coherence  across all measured frequency bands at 42 months of age. However, age at foster  care placement within the foster care group was correlated with certain measures  of EEG power and coherence. Earlier age at foster care placement was associated  with increased alpha power and decreased short-distance EEG coherence. Further  analyses separating age at placement from duration of intervention suggest that  this effect may be more robust for EEG coherence than EEG band power.

Executive functions and school readiness intervention: impact, moderation, and  mediation in the Head Start REDI program.	Bierman KL(1), Nix RL, Greenberg MT, Blair C, Domitrovich CE.	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA. kb2@psu.edu	Despite their potentially central role in fostering school readiness, executive  function (EF) skills have received little explicit attention in the design and  evaluation of school readiness interventions for socioeconomically disadvantaged  children. The present study examined a set of five EF measures in the context of  a randomized-controlled trial of a research-based intervention integrated into  Head Start programs (Head Start REDI). Three hundred fifty-six 4-year-old  children (17% Hispanic, 25% African American; 54% girls) were followed over the  course of the prekindergarten year. Initial EF predicted gains in cognitive and  social-emotional skills and moderated the impact of the Head Start REDI  intervention on some outcomes. The REDI intervention promoted gains on two EF  measures, which partially mediated intervention effects on school readiness. We  discuss the importance of further study of the neurobiological bases of school  readiness, the implications for intervention design, and the value of  incorporating markers of neurobiological processes into school readiness  interventions.

Effects of an attachment-based intervention on daily cortisol moderated by  dopamine receptor D4: a randomized control trial on 1- to 3-year-olds screened  for externalizing behavior.	Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ(1), Van Ijzendoorn MH, Mesman J, Alink LR, Juffer F.	Author information: (1)Centre for Child and Family Studies, Leiden University, The Netherlands.  bakermans@fsw.leidenuniv.nl	The effect of the Video-Feedback Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting and  Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD) on daily cortisol production was tested in a  randomized controlled trial with 130 families with 1- to 3-year-old children  screened for their relatively high levels of externalizing behavior. Six 1.5-hr  intervention sessions focusing on maternal sensitivity and discipline were  conducted with individual families at their homes. Children in the intervention  group showed lower cortisol levels, with a moderating role of the dopamine  receptor D4 (DRD4) VNTR exon III polymorphism. The VIPP-SD program proved to be  effective in decreasing daily cortisol production in children with the DRD4  7-repeat allele, but not in children without the DRD4 7-repeat allele. Our  findings indicate that children are differentially susceptible to intervention  effects dependent on the presence of the 7-repeat DRD4 allele.

Author information: (1)Autism Speaks, Hillsborough, NC 27278, USA. gdawson@autismspeaks.org	Advances in the fields of cognitive and affective developmental neuroscience,  developmental psychopathology, neurobiology, genetics, and applied behavior  analysis have contributed to a more optimistic outcome for individuals with  autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These advances have led to new methods for early  detection and more effective treatments. For the first time, prevention of ASD  is plausible. Prevention will entail detecting infants at risk before the full  syndrome is present and implementing treatments designed to alter the course of  early behavioral and brain development. This article describes a developmental  model of risk, risk processes, symptom emergence, and adaptation in ASD that  offers a framework for understanding early brain plasticity in ASD and its role  in prevention of the disorder.

Understanding the association between adolescent marijuana use and later serious  drug use: gateway effect or developmental trajectory?	Cleveland HH(1), Wiebe RP.	Author information: (1)Department of Human Development and Family Studies, S113-C Henderson,  Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA. hhc10@psu.edu	Because marijuana use often precedes the use of other psychoactive substances,  it has been characterized as a gateway to these other substances. The present  study used data from both monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs drawn  from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Youth (Add Health) to examine  the "gateway effect" role of earlier marijuana on later hard drug use.  Difference score analyses reveal that within-pair differences in earlier  marijuana use, controlling for differences in earlier hard drug use, and peer  marijuana use predicted later within-pair hard drug use differences for DZ twin  pairs. In contrast, earlier differences in marijuana use among MZ twin pairs did  not predict later hard drug use differences. Rather than supporting the  interpretation that earlier marijuana use "triggers" later hard drug use, these  results suggest that the longitudinal pattern of drug use that has been  interpreted as the "gateway effect" might be better conceptualized as a  genetically influenced developmental trajectory.

Author information: (1)Institute for Behavioral Sciences and the Law, 750 SE 3rd Avenue, Suite 204,  Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316, USA. ekimonis@forensic-experts.net	Callous-unemotional (CU) traits in antisocial youth have been associated with  deficits in the processing of emotionally distressing stimuli in a number of  past studies. In the current study, we investigated moderators of this  association in a sample of 88 ethnically diverse detained boys (mean age =  15.57, SD = 1.28). Overall, emotional processing of distressing stimuli using a  dot-probe task was not related to CU traits and there was no moderating effect  of ethnicity. However, CU traits were related to deficits in emotional  processing in youth high on aggression and youth high on exposure to community  violence. Further, youth high on CU traits but with enhanced orienting to  distressing stimuli had stronger histories of abuse, supporting the possibility  that there may be environmentally influenced pathways in the development of  these traits.

Box 9555, 2300RB  Leiden, The Netherlands. SHuijbregts@fsw.leidenuniv.nl	This study investigated joint effects of maternal prenatal smoking and parental  history of antisocial behavior on physical aggression between ages 17 and 42  months in a population sample of children born in Québec (N = 1,745). An  analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant main effects of maternal  prenatal smoking and a significant interaction between maternal prenatal smoking  and mother's history of antisocial behavior in the prediction of children's  probability to display high and rising physical aggression. The interaction  indicated that the effects of heavy smoking during pregnancy (> or =10  cigarettes/day) were greater when the mother also had a serious history of  antisocial behavior. The effects remained significant after the introduction of  control variables (e.g., hostile-reactive parenting, family functioning,  parental separation/divorce, family income, and maternal education). Another  significant interaction not accounted for by control variables was observed for  maternal prenatal smoking and family income, indicating more serious effects of  maternal prenatal smoking under relatively low-income, conditions. Both  interactions indicate critical adversities that, in combination with maternal  prenatal smoking, have supra-additive effects on (the development of) physical  aggression during early childhood. These findings may have implications for the  selection of intervention targets and strategies.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579408000217 PMCID: PMC3283583 PMID: 18423088 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Stifter CA(1), Putnam S, Jahromi L.	Author information: (1)Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16803, USA. tvr@psu.edu	Temperament, effortful control, and problem behaviors at 4.5 years were assessed  in 72 children classified as exuberant, inhibited, and low reactive as  2-year-olds. Exuberant toddlers were more positive, socially responsive to novel  persons, less shy, and rated as having more problem behaviors, including  externalizing and internalizing behaviors, than other children as preschoolers.  Two forms of effortful control, the ability to delay a response and the ability  to produce a subdominant response, were associated with fewer externalizing  behaviors, whereas expressing more negative affect (relative to positive/neutral  affect) when disappointed was related to more internalizing behaviors.  Interaction effects implicated high levels of unregulated emotion during  disappointment as a risk factor for problem behaviors in exuberant children.

Author information: (1)University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, USA. izard@udel.edu	Separate studies of rural and urban Head Start systems tested the hypothesis  that an emotion-based prevention program (EBP) would accelerate the development  of emotion and social competence and decrease agonistic behavior and potential  precursors of psychopathology. In both studies, Head Start centers were randomly  assigned to treatment and control/comparison group conditions. In Study 1 (rural  community), results of hierarchical linear modeling analyses showed that  compared to the control condition (Head Start as usual), EBP produced greater  increases in emotion knowledge and emotion regulation and greater decreases in  children's negative emotion expressions, aggression, anxious/depressed behavior,  and negative peer and adult interactions. In Study 2 (inner city), compared to  the established prevention program I Can Problem Solve, EBP led to greater  increases in emotion knowledge, emotion regulation, positive emotion expression,  and social competence. In Study 2, emotion knowledge mediated the effects of EBP  on emotion regulation, and emotion competence (an aggregate of emotion knowledge  and emotion regulation) mediated the effects of EBP on social competence.

Boden JM(1), Fergusson DM, Horwood LJ.	Author information: (1)Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Christchurch, New  Zealand. joseph.boden@otago.ac.nz	This paper examines the relationship between self-esteem in adolescence and  later mental health, substance use, and life and relationship outcomes in  adulthood. The investigation analyzed data from a birth cohort of approximately  1,000 New Zealand young adults studied to the age of 25. Lower levels of  self-esteem at age 15 were associated with greater risks of mental health  problems, substance dependence, and lower levels of life and relationship  satisfaction at ages 18, 21, and 25. Adjustment for potentially confounding  factors reduced the strength of these associations to either moderate or  statistically nonsignificant levels. It was concluded that the effects of  self-esteem during adolescence on later developmental outcomes were weak, and  largely explained by the psychosocial context within which self-esteem develops.

Worthman CM(1), Panter-Brick C.	Author information: (1)Emory University,Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. worthman@emory.edu	As challenges to child well-being through economic disadvantage, family  disruption, and migration or displacement escalate world wide, the need for  cross-culturally robust understanding of childhood adversity proportionately  increases. Toward this end, developmental risk was assessed in four contrasting  groups of 107 Nepali children ages 10-14 years that represent distinctive,  common conditions in which contemporary children grow up. Relative cumulative  burden (allostatic load) indexed by multiple dimensions of physical and  psychosocial stress was ascertained among homeless street boys and three  family-based groups, from poor urban squatter settlements, urban middle class,  and a remote rural village. Biomarkers of stress and vulnerability to stress  included growth status, salivary cortisol, antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus,  acute phase inflammatory responses (alpha1-antichymotrypsin), and cardiovascular  fitness and reactivity (flex heart rate and pressor response). Individual  biomarkers of risk and allostatic load differed markedly among groups, were  highest in villagers, and varied by components of allostatic load. Such data  suggest a need for critical appraisal of homelessness and migration as a risk  factor to youth, given prevailing local conditions such as rural poverty, and  represents the only multidimensional study of childhood allostatic load and  developmental risk in non-Western settings.

Smoking during pregnancy and offspring externalizing problems: an exploration of  genetic and environmental confounds.

Author information: (1)Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405, USA. bmdonofr@indiana.edu	Previous studies have documented that smoking during pregnancy (SDP) is  associated with offspring externalizing problems, even when measured covariates  were used to control for possible confounds. However, the association may be  because of nonmeasured environmental and genetic factors that increase risk for  offspring externalizing problems. The current project used the National  Longitudinal Survey of Youth and their children, ages 4-10 years, to explore the  relations between SDP and offspring conduct problems (CPs), oppositional defiant  problems (ODPs), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity problems (ADHPs) using  methodological and statistical controls for confounds. When offspring were  compared to their own siblings who differed in their exposure to prenatal  nicotine, there was no effect of SDP on offspring CP and ODP. This suggests that  SDP does not have a causal effect on offspring CP and ODP. There was a small  association between SDP and ADHP, consistent with a causal effect of SDP, but  the magnitude of the association was greatly reduced by methodological and  statistical controls. Genetically informed analyses suggest that unmeasured  environmental variables influencing both SDP and offspring externalizing  behaviors account for the previously observed associations. That is, the current  analyses imply that important unidentified environmental factors account for the  association between SDP and offspring externalizing problems, not teratogenic  effects of SDP.

Cicchetti D(1), Rogosch FA, Sturge-Apple ML.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development and Department of Psychiatry, University of  Minnesota, 51 East River Road, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.	Child maltreatment and polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and  monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genes were examined in relation to depressive  symptomatology. Adolescents (M age = 16.7 years) from low socioeconomic  backgrounds with a history of child maltreatment (n = 207) or no such history (n  = 132) were interviewed and provided buccal cells for genetic analysis. Gene x  environment interactions were observed. Heightened depressive symptoms were  found only among extensively maltreated youth with low MAOA activity. Among  comparably maltreated youth with high MAOA activity, self-coping strategies  related to lower symptoms. Sexual abuse and the 5-HTT short/short genotype  predicted higher depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. This Gene x  Environment interaction was further moderated by MAOA activity level. The  results highlight the protective functions of genetic polymorphisms and coping  strategies in high risk youth and offer direction for understanding resilience  and its promotion from a multiple levels of analysis perspective.

Evidence for a gene-gene interaction in predicting children's behavior problems:  association of serotonin transporter short and dopamine receptor D4 long  genotypes with internalizing and externalizing behaviors in typically developing  7-year-olds.	Schmidt LA(1), Fox NA, Hamer DH.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Neuroscience and Behaviour, 1280 Main Street West,  McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4K1, Canada. schmidtl@mcmaster.ca	Recent work on the molecular genetics of complex traits in typical and atypical  human development has focused primarily on associations of single genes with  behavior. Disparate literature suggests that the presence of one or two copies  of the short allele of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene and the long  allele (7-repeat allele) version of the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene  predicts internalizing- and externalizing-related behaviors, respectively.  Apparently for the first time in the extant literature, we report a gene-gene  statistical interaction on behavior problems in a group of typically developing  children at age 7. DNA was extracted from buccal cells collected from 108  children and genotyped for short and long alleles of the 5-HTT gene and the  short (2-5 repeats) versus long (6-8 repeats) allele of the DRD4 gene. Mothers  completed the Child Behavior Checklist. As predicted, children with one or two  copies of the short allele of the 5-HTT gene and the long allele version of the  DRD4 gene exhibited significantly more internalizing and externalizing behaviors  at age 7 than children with other combinations of the 5-HTT and DRD4 short and  long genotypes. As well, children with the 5-HTT long and DRD4 long genotypes  had the lowest reported scores on internalizing and externalizing behaviors at  age 7, suggesting that the presence of the 5-HTT long genotype may serve as a  protective factor against these behaviors in children with the long DRD4  genotype. Implications of these findings for understanding cumulative biological  risk and protective factors in childhood behavior problems and psychopathology  are discussed.

Author information: (1)University of Denver, Department of Psychology, Frontier Hall, 2155 S Race  Street, Denver, CO 80209, USA. lmcgrath@du.edu	Few studies have investigated the role of gene x environment interactions (G x  E) in speech, language, and literacy disorders. Currently, there are two  theoretical models, the diathesis-stress model and the bioecological model, that  make opposite predictions about the expected direction of G x E, because  environmental risk factors may either strengthen or weaken the effect of genes  on phenotypes. The purpose of the current study was to test for G x E at two  speech sound disorder and reading disability linkage peaks using a sib-pair  linkage design and continuous measures of socioeconomic status, home  language/literacy environment, and number of ear infections. The interactions  were tested using composite speech, language, and preliteracy phenotypes and  previously identified linkage peaks on 6p22 and 15q21. Results showed five G x E  at both the 6p22 and 15q21 locations across several phenotypes and environmental  measures. Four of the five interactions were consistent with the bioecological  model of G x E. Each of these four interactions involved environmental measures  of the home language/literacy environment. The only interaction that was  consistent with the diathesis-stress model was one involving the number of ear  infections as the environmental risk variable. The direction of these  interactions and possible interpretations are explored in the discussion.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579407000533 PMID: 17931434 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Parenting quality interacts with genetic variation in dopamine receptor D4 to  influence temperament in early childhood.	Sheese BE(1), Voelker PM, Rothbart MK, Posner MI.	Author information: (1)University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 99403-1227, USA.	We examined the influence of a common allelic variation in the dopamine receptor  D4 (DRD4) gene and caregiver quality on temperament in early childhood. Children  18-21 months of age were genotyped for the DRD4 48 base pair tandem repeat  polymorphism, which has been implicated in the development of attention,  sensation seeking, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The children  also interacted with their caregiver for 10 min in a laboratory setting, and  these videotaped interactions were coded for parenting quality using an  observational rating procedure. The presence of the DRD4 7-repeat allele was  associated with differences in the influence of parenting on a measure of  temperamental sensation seeking constructed from caregiver reports on children's  activity level, impulsivity, and high-intensity pleasure. Children with the  7-repeat allele were influenced by parenting quality, with lower quality  parenting associated with higher levels of sensation seeking; children without  the 7-repeat allele were uninfluenced by parenting quality. Differences between  alleles were not related to the child's self-regulation as assessed by the  effortful control measure. Previous studies have indicated that the 7-repeat  allele is under positive selective pressure, and our results are consistent with  the hypothesis that the DRD4 7-repeat allele increased children's sensitivity to  environmental factors such as parenting. This study shows that genes influence  the relation between parenting and temperament in ways that are important to  normal development and psychopathology.

Author information: (1)Department of Philosophy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.  tabery@philosophy.utah.edu	A history of research on gene-environment interaction (G x E) is provided in  this article, revealing the fact that there have actually been two distinct  concepts of G x E since the very origins of this research. R. A. Fisher  introduced what I call the biometric concept of G x E (G x EB), whereas Lancelot  Hogben introduced what I call the developmental concept of G x E (G x ED). Much  of the subsequent history of research on G x E has largely consisted of the  separate legacies of these separate concepts, along with the (sometimes  acrimonious) disputes that have arisen time and again when employers of each  have argued over the appropriate way to conceptualize the phenomenon. With this  history in place, more recent attempts to distinguish between different concepts  of G x E are considered, paying particular attention to the commonly made  distinction between "statistical interaction" and "interactionism," and Michael  Rutter's distinction between statistical interaction and "the biological concept  of interaction." I argue that the history of the separate legacies of G x EB and  G x ED better supports Rutter's analysis of the situation and that this analysis  best paves the way for an integrative relationship between the various  scientists investigating the place of G x E in the etiology of complex traits.

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities,  Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. amasten@umn.edu	Perspectives based on the first three waves of resilience research are discussed  with the goal of informing the fourth wave of work, which is characterized by a  focus on multilevel analysis and the dynamics of adaptation and change.  Resilience is defined as a broad systems construct, referring to the capacity of  dynamic systems to withstand or recover from significant disturbances. As the  systems perspective on resilience builds strength and technologies of measuring  and analyzing multiple levels of functioning and their interactions improve, it  is becoming feasible to study gene-environment interactions, the development of  adaptive systems and their role in resilience, and to conduct experiments to  foster resilience or reprogram the fundamental adaptive systems that protect  development in the context of adversity. Hot spots for future research to study  and integrate multiple levels of analysis are delineated on the basis of  evidence gleaned from the first waves of resilience research.

Cicchetti D(1), Rogosch FA.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN  55455, USA.	In this multilevel investigation, resilience in adaptive functioning among  maltreated and nonmaltreated low-income children (N = 677) was examined in  relation to the regulation of two stress-responsive adrenal steroid hormones,  cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), as well as the personality  constructs of ego resiliency and ego control. Maltreatment status was not  related to differences in average levels of morning or afternoon cortisol or  DHEA. However, lower morning cortisol was related to higher resilient  functioning, but only in nonmaltreated children. In contrast, among physically  abused children, high morning cortisol was related to higher resilient  functioning. Morning and afternoon DHEA was negatively related to resilient  functioning. Although diurnal change in cortisol was not related to resilience,  for DHEA, maltreated children with high resilience showed an atypical rise in  DHEA from morning to afternoon. Morning and afternoon cortisol/DHEA ratios were  positively related to resilient functioning, but did not interact with  maltreatment status. Ego resiliency and ego control strongly differentiated  maltreated and nonmaltreated children, and the personality variables were  substantially predictive of resilience. When considered together, demonstrated  effects of personality, cortisol, and DHEA maintained independent contributions  in predicting resilience among high-risk youth.

Children from two independent samples were classified as resilient if  they avoided developing ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), or conduct  disorder (CD) in the face of family adversity. Two protective factors were  examined for their potential relevance to prefrontal brain development:  neuropsychological response inhibition, as assessed by the Stop task, and a  composite catecholamine genotype risk score. Resilient children were  characterized in both samples by more effective response inhibition, although  the effect in the second sample was very small. Genotype was measured in Sample  1, and a composite high risk genotype index was developed by summing presence of  risk across markers on three genes expressed in prefrontal cortex: dopamine  transporter, dopamine D4 receptor, and noradrenergic alpha-2 receptor. Genotype  was a reliable resilience indicator against development of ADHD and CD, but not  ODD, in the face of psychosocial adversity. Results illustrate potential  neurobiological protective factors related to development of prefrontal cortex  that may enable children to avoid developing ADHD and CD in the presence of  psychosocial adversity.

Biological, behavioral, and relational levels of resilience in the context of  risk for early childhood behavior problems.	Calkins SD(1), Blandon AY, Williford AP, Keane SP.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of North Carolina at Greensboro,  Greensboro, NC 27402, USA. sdcalkin@uncg.edu	Longitudinal growth patterns of internalizing and externalizing behavior  problems were examined in a community sample of 441 children across the ages of  2 to 5 using hierarchical linear modeling. Contextual risk was measured using  five indicators (socioeconomic status, marital status, number of siblings,  parent stress, parent psychopathology), and three levels of child resilience  (biological, behavioral, and relational) were also assessed. Results indicate  that a general pattern of decline in both types of behavior problems was  observed for the entire sample across time, although considerable individual  variability in this pattern was observed. Children's externalizing and  internalizing behavior at age 5 was predicted by the level of risk at age 2. All  three child resilience factors were also predictive of externalizing and  internalizing behaviors at age 5. In the prediction of the slope of problem  behavior over time, risk status interacted with both temperamental fearlessness  and a mutually responsive orientation with the mother to predict the decline in  externalizing and internalizing problem behavior. Results underscore the complex  interactions of risk and multiple levels of resilience that are implicated in  the maintenance of problem behavior over time. They highlight the importance of  considering whether expected resilience factors operate similarly across  different levels of risk.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,  Champaign, IL 61820, USA. krudolph@uiuc.edu	This research examined three possible models to explain how childhood social  adversity and recent stress interact to predict depression in youth: stress  sensitization, stress amplification, and stress inoculation. Drawing from a  stress-sensitization theory of depression, we hypothesized that exposure to  childhood adversity, in the form of disruptions in critical interpersonal  relationships, would lower youths' threshold for depressive reactions to recent  interpersonal stress. We expected that this pattern of stress sensitization  would be most salient for girls negotiating the pubertal transition. These  hypotheses were examined in two studies: a longitudinal, questionnaire-based  investigation of 399 youth (M = 11.66 years) and a concurrent, interview-based  investigation of 147 youth (M = 12.39 years). Findings supported the role of  stress-sensitization processes in pubertal girls and prepubertal boys, and  stress-amplification processes in prepubertal girls. Childhood social adversity  specifically predicted sensitization to recent interpersonal, but not  noninterpersonal, stress. These findings build on prior theory and research by  suggesting that early adversity exerts context-specific effects that vary across  gender and development. Future research will need to identify the specific  mechanisms underlying this stress-sensitization process.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579407070241 PMCID: PMC3174013 PMID: 17459181 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Stieben J(1), Lewis MD, Granic I, Zelazo PD, Segalowitz S, Pepler D.	Author information: (1)Harris Research Initiative, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  jstieben@yorku.ca	Children referred for externalizing behavior problems may not represent a  homogeneous population. Our objective was to assess neural mechanisms of emotion  regulation that might distinguish subtypes of externalizing children from each  other and from their normal age mates. Children with pure externalizing (EXT)  problems were compared with children comorbid for externalizing and  internalizing (MIXED) problems and with age-matched controls. Only boys were  included in the analysis because so few girls were referred for treatment. We  used a go/no-go task with a negative emotion induction, and we examined  dense-array EEG data together with behavioral measures of performance. We  investigated two event-related potential (ERP) components tapping inhibitory  control or self-monitoring - the inhibitory N2 and error-related negativity  (ERN) - and we constructed source models estimating their cortical generators.  The MIXED children's N2s increased in response to the emotion induction,  resulting in greater amplitudes than EXT children in the following trial block.  ERN amplitudes were greatest for control children and smallest for EXT children  with MIXED children in between, but only prior to the emotion induction. These  results were paralleled by behavioral differences in response time and  performance monitoring. ERP activity was localized to cortical sources  suggestive of the dorsal anterior cingulate for control children, posterior  cingulate areas for the EXT children, and both posterior cingulate and ventral  cingulate/prefrontal regions for the MIXED children. These findings highlight  different mechanisms of self-regulation underlying externalizing subtypes and  point toward distinct developmental pathways and treatment strategies.

Vitaro F(1), Pedersen S, Brendgen M.	Author information: (1)University of Montreal, Montpetit, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  frank.vitaro@umontreal.ca	This study examined whether peer rejection and affiliation with deviant friends  throughout childhood could mediate the link between early disruptiveness and two  aspects of delinquent behaviors (i.e., violence and substance use) in a sample  of 375 children. Furthermore, we tested whether the two putative mediators  operated in a sequential manner or in a parallel manner. Participants'  disruptiveness, peer rejection, and friends' deviancy were assessed throughout  childhood (ages 7 to 13). Delinquency-related outcomes were assessed at ages 14  and 15 years. Results indicate that the sequential mediational model was  supported when delinquency-related violence was the outcome, but not when  substance use was the outcome. The discussion stresses the differential role of  peer rejection and affiliation with deviant friends in regard to the two  outcomes considered in this study and in regard to the time frame when they were  measured.

Box 311280, Denton,  TX 76203-1280, USA. riggs@unt.edu	The present study examined self-reported romantic attachment style and Adult  Attachment Interview (AAI) states of mind regarding early attachment  relationships, personality dimensions, and psychopathology in a psychiatric  sample of trauma survivors. Inpatients (N = 80) admitted to a hospital trauma  treatment program were administered the Experiences in Close Relationships  Scale, AAI, Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III, Dissociative Experiences  Scale, and Dissociative Disorder Interview Schedule. Self-report and AAI  attachment classifications were not related, and different results emerged for  the two measures. Self-reported romantic attachment style was significantly  associated with personality dimensions, with fearful adults showing the most  maladaptive personality profiles. Findings suggested that self-report dimensions  of self and other independently contribute to different forms of psychological  dysfunction. AAI unresolved trauma was uniquely associated with dissociation and  posttraumatic stress disorder, whereas unresolved trauma and unresolved loss  jointly contributed to schizotypal and borderline personality disorder scores.  The differences in findings between the two measures are discussed with a view  toward the developmental and clinical implications.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579407070149 PMID: 17241494 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Developmental Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Van der  Boechorststraat 1, Amsterdam 1081 BT, The Netherlands. pac.van.lier@psy.vu.nl	Predictors and concurrent correlates of childhood-onset and adolescent-onset  antisocial behavior were studied in a sample of 165 boys and 151 girls, followed  from age 6 to age 15. An integrated general growth mixture model was used to  determine the number and shape of developmental trajectories of antisocial  behavior exhibited by boys and girls. Associations of these trajectories with  trajectories of attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADH) problems and deviant peer  affiliation were examined. A childhood-onset, an adolescent-onset, and a low  antisocial behavior trajectory were identified. A minority of the sample (11%),  mostly males, followed the childhood-onset trajectory. This trajectory was  predicted by prior membership in the high ADH trajectory in childhood. The  adolescent-onset trajectory (46%) was associated with increases in friends'  antisocial behavior but not with ADH problems. Most females (60%) followed the  low antisocial trajectory. A substantial proportion of females, however,  followed the childhood (5%) and adolescent-onset trajectories (35%). The  male-female ratios in the childhood and adolescent-onset trajectories were  similar. The results largely supported theories that distinguish between  childhood and adolescent onsets of antisocial behavior, but they did not suggest  that boys and girls differ in the age of onset of antisocial behavior.

Papadakis AA(1), Prince RP, Jones NP, Strauman TJ.	Author information: (1)Loyola College in Maryland, Department of Psychology, Baltimore 21210, USA.  apapadakis@loyola.edu	There is increasing evidence that with the onset of adolescence, girls  experience higher rates of depression than boys. However, a comprehensive  understanding of the risk factors contributing to this emerging gender  difference has yet to be attained. Previous studies indicate that both  self-discrepancy, the perception that one is failing to attain an important  personal goal, and ruminative coping, a tendency to passively and repetitively  focus on one's failure and the causes and consequences of that failure,  contribute to depression and that adolescent girls are more likely to manifest  each than adolescent boys. In this translational study we tested the hypothesis  that, whereas both actual:ideal discrepancy and ruminative coping style would  independently predict depression in adolescent girls, the combination of high  levels of actual:ideal discrepancy and ruminative coping would predict more  severe depressive symptoms. Analyses of cross-sectional data in a sample of 223  girls ranging from 7th through 12th grades revealed a significant main effect  for ruminative coping style and a trend for actual:ideal discrepancy, as well as  the predicted interaction effect. We discuss the implications of this  integrative psychosocial model for the etiology, treatment, and prevention of  depression in adolescent girls.

Author information: (1)Center for the Study of Child Development, University of Haifa, Israel.  oppenhei@psy.haifa.ac.il	Studies using narratives with children and parents offer ways to study affective  meaning-making processes that are central in many theories of developmental  psychopathology. This paper reviews theory regarding affective meaning making,  and argues that narratives are particularly suited to examine such processes.  The review of narrative studies and methods is organized into three sections  according to the focus on child, parent, and parent-child narratives. Within  each focus three levels of analysis are considered: (a) narrative organization  and coherence, (b) narrative content, and (c) the behavior/interactions of the  narrator(s). The implications of this research for developmental psychopathology  and clinical work are discussed with an emphasis on parent-child jointly  constructed narratives as the meeting point of individual child and parent  narratives.

Davies PT(1), Winter MA, Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology, University of  Rochester, NY 14627, USA. davies@psych.rochester.edu	Understanding why interparental difficulties pose a risk to children in families  experiencing domestic violence is an urgent task for ameliorating childhood  psychopathology, particularly in light of the paucity of knowledge on the  unfolding mediating mechanisms and the potentiating and protective conditions  that underlie the multiplicity of pathways between domestic violence and child  maladjustment. Toward addressing this significant gap, this paper examines how  the emotional security theory (EST) may foster advances in our understanding of  the genesis, course, and treatment of children's psychological problems in  families experiencing domestic violence. Following an overview of the  theoretical assumptions and significance of translating the emotional security  theory to high-risk contexts, we address how children's difficulties in  preserving security may emerge in the face of domestic violence and accompanying  forms of severe family adversity, and illustrate the implications of emotional  insecurity for childhood psychopathology in homes characterized by domestic  violences. In the final section, we address how the EST may be useful in  informing public policy and intervention initiatives designed to reduce the  burden of mental illness.

Ayoub CC(1), O'Connor E, Rappolt-Schlichtmann G, Fischer KW, Rogosch FA, Toth  SL, Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Harvard Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.	Through a translational approach, dynamic skill theory enhances the  understanding of the variation in the behavioral and cognitive presentations of  a high-risk population-maltreated children. Two studies illustrate the  application of normative developmental constructs from a dynamic skills  perspective to samples of young maltreated and nonmaltreated children. Each  study examines the emotional and cognitive development of maltreated children  with attention to their developing world view or negativity bias and cognitive  skills. Across both studies, maltreated children demonstrate negativity bias  when compared to their nonmaltreated counterparts. Cognitive complexity  demonstrated by the maltreated children is dependent upon a positive or negative  context. Positive problem solving is more difficult for maltreated children when  compared to their nonmaltreated counterparts. Differences by maltreatment type,  severity, timing of the abuse, and identity of the perpetrator are also  delineated, and variation in the resulting developmental trajectories in each  case is explored. This translation of dynamic skill theory, as applied to  maltreated children, enhances our basic understanding of their functioning,  clarifies the nature of their developmental differences, and underscores the  need for early intervention.

Cicchetti D(1), Rogosch FA, Toth SL.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455,  USA.	The malleability of insecure and disorganized attachment among infants from  maltreating families was investigated through a randomized preventive  intervention trial. Findings from research on the effects of maltreatment on  infant attachment were incorporated into the design and evaluation of the  intervention. One-year-old infants from maltreating families (N = 137) and their  mothers were randomly assigned to one of three intervention conditions: (a)  infant-parent psychotherapy (IPP), (b) psychoeducational parenting intervention  (PPI), and (c) community standard (CS) controls. A fourth group of infants from  nonmaltreating families (N = 52) and their mothers served as an additional  low-income normative comparison (NC) group. At baseline, mothers in the  maltreatment group, relative to the nonmaltreatment group mothers, reported  greater abuse and neglect in their own childhoods, more insecure relationships  with their own mothers, more maladaptive parenting attitudes, more parenting  stress, and lower family support, and they were observed to evince lower  maternal sensitivity. Infants in the maltreatment groups had significantly  higher rates of disorganized attachment than infants in the NC group. At  postintervention follow-up at age 26 months, children in the IPP and PPI groups  demonstrated substantial increases in secure attachment, whereas increases in  secure attachment were not found for the CS and NC groups. Moreover,  disorganized attachment continued to predominate in the CS group. These results  were maintained when intent to treat analyses were conducted. The findings are  discussed in terms of the utility of translating basic research into the design  and evaluation of clinical trials, as well as the importance of preventive  interventions for altering attachment organization and promoting an adaptive  developmental course for infants in maltreating families.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309-0345,  USA. miklow@psych.colorado.edu	Mood disorder symptoms and their associated functional impairments are  hypothesized to come about as the result of the conjoint, interactive influences  of genetic, biological, and psychological vulnerabilities, family distress, and  life stress at different points of development. We discuss a developmental  psychopathology model that delineates pathways to high family conflict and mood  exacerbation among early-onset bipolar patients. New data from a treatment  development study indicate that adolescent bipolar patients in high expressed  emotion families have more symptomatic courses of illness over 2 years than  adolescents in low expressed emotion families. Chronic and episodic stressors  are also correlated with lack of mood improvement while adolescents are in  treatment. Family-focused treatment (FFT) given in conjunction with  pharmacotherapy appears to ameliorate the course of bipolar disorder in adults.  This treatment has recently been modified to address the developmental  presentation of bipolar disorder among adolescents. We present data from an open  trial of FFT and pharmacotherapy (N = 20) indicating that bipolar adolescents  stabilize in mania, depression, and parent-rated problem behaviors over 2 years.  Future research should focus on clarifying the developmental pathways to  early-onset bipolar disorder and the role of protective factors and preventative  psychosocial interventions in delaying the first onset of the disorder.

However, recent work from an affective neuroscience  perspective has advanced what is known about the boundaries of emotion  regulation in BD compared to typically developing youth. In this article, we  first briefly review the clinical issues that have contributed to this  diagnostic controversy. Second, we discuss our phenotyping system, which can be  used to guide neurobiological research designed to address these controversial  issues. Third, we review what is known about the fundamentals of emotion  regulation in human and nonhuman primate models. Fourth, we present recent data  demonstrating how children and adolescents with BD differ from those without  psychopathology on measures of emotion regulation. Taken as a whole, this work  implicates a neural circuit encompassing the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and  striatum in the pathophysiology of pediatric BD.

Subjects were  outpatients obtained by consecutive new case ascertainment. There were 81  subjects who were 9.7 +/- 2.0 years. Subjects had DSM-IV ADHD (hyperactive or  combined subtypes); a Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) score of < or  =60, consistent with moderate-severe impairment; and no BP or major depressive  disorder (MDD) diagnoses. PEA-BP-I was defined as DSM-IV BP I (manic or mixed  phase), with cardinal symptoms (elation and/or grandiosity), to avoid diagnosing  mania by symptoms that overlapped with those of ADHD, and by a CGAS score of <  or =60. Morbid risk of switching to PEA-BP-I was 28.5%. Significant predictors  of switching in a multivariate Cox model were more severe baseline CGAS,  paternal recurrent MDD, and less stimulant use. BP I in first-degree relatives,  antidepressants, psychosocial measures, and life events were not predictive.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579406060512 PMID: 17064428 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Race  Street, Denver, CO 80208, USA. lberger@du.edu	This study examined whether attachment theory could be used to shed light on the  often high degree of discordance between self- and observer ratings of  behavioral functioning and symptomatology. Interview-based assessments of  attachment organization, using the Adult Attachment Interview, were examined as  predictors of the lack of agreement between self- and other reports of  behavioral and emotional problems among 176 moderately at-risk adolescents. Lack  of agreement was measured in terms of concordance of adolescent and parent or  close friend report on equivalent measures of behavioral and emotional  adjustment. Insecure-dismissing attachment was linked to less agreement in  absolute terms between self- and mother reports of externalizing symptoms, and  between adolescent and close friend reports of behavioral conduct.  Insecure-preoccupied attachment was associated with higher levels of adolescent  reporting of internalizing and externalizing symptoms relative to parent reports  of adolescent symptomatology. The findings suggest that attachment organization  may be one factor that accounts for individual differences in the degree of  discordance between self- and other reports of symptoms in adolescence.

Developmental experience plays a role, along with heritable, polygenic  variation, in calibrating the response dynamics of these systems, with early  adversity biasing their combined effects toward a profile of heightened or  prolonged reactivity. Conventional views of such high reactivity suggest that it  is an atavistic and pathogenic legacy of an evolutionary past in which threats  to survival were more prevalent and severe. Recent evidence, however, indicates  that (a) stress reactivity is not a unitary process, but rather incorporates  counterregulatory circuits serving to modify or temper physiological arousal,  and (b) the effects of high reactivity phenotypes on psychiatric and biomedical  outcomes are bivalent, rather than univalent, in character, exerting both  risk-augmenting and risk-protective effects in a context-dependent manner. These  observations suggest that heightened stress reactivity may reflect, not simply  exaggerated arousal under challenge, but rather an increased biological  sensitivity to context, with potential for negative health effects under  conditions of adversity and positive effects under conditions of support and  protection. From an evolutionary perspective, the developmental plasticity of  the stress response systems, along with their structured, context-dependent  effects, suggests that these systems may constitute conditional adaptations:  evolved psychobiological mechanisms that monitor specific features of childhood  environments as a basis for calibrating the development of stress response  systems to adaptively match those environments. Taken together, these  theoretical perspectives generate a novel hypothesis: that there is a  curvilinear, U-shaped relation between early exposures to adversity and the  development of stress-reactive profiles, with high reactivity phenotypes  disproportionately emerging within both highly stressful and highly protected  early social environments.

Brendel GR(1), Stern E, Silbersweig DA.	Author information: (1)Weill Medical College of Cornell University, USA. grbrendel@verizon.net	Functional neuroimaging recently has been used to localize brain dysfunction in  borderline personality disorder (BPD). Initial studies have examined baseline  activity or emotional reactivity, and our group has investigated what we  consider to be a crucial interaction between negative emotion and behavioral  (dys)control. This research is beginning to identify abnormal frontolimbic  circuitry likely underlying core clinical features of this condition. We review  the evidence for dysfunction in specific frontolimbic regions, leading to a  mechanistic model of symptom formation in BPD. In addition, we offer an  integration of these neuroimaging findings with developmental perspectives on  the emergence of borderline psychopathology, focusing on the ways in which early  psychosocial experience may interact with developing brain systems. We also  consider possible mechanisms of psychotherapeutic change at the neural systems  level in BPD. Finally, we propose that future neuroimaging studies of BPD should  integrate multiple levels of observation (structural, functional, neurochemical,  genetic, and clinical) in a model-driven fashion to further understand the  dynamic relationship between biological and psychological factors in the  development and treatment of this difficult condition.

Author information: (1)University of California, San Diego, Department of Psychiatry, Outpatient  Psychiatric Services, 92103, USA. pjudd@ucsd.edu	Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a pervasive  instability of interpersonal relationships, affects, self-image, marked  impulsivity, dissociation, and paranoia. The cognitive dimension of the disorder  has received relatively little attention and is poorly understood. This paper  proposes that neurocognitive impairment is a key moderator in the development of  BPD and elaborates a possible pathway for the expression of the cognitive  domain. Neurocognitive impairment is hypothesized to moderate the relationship  between caretaking and insecure disorganized attachment and pathological  dissociation in the formation of the disorder contributing to impaired  metacognition and a range of cognitive difficulties. The empirical evidence from  studies of cognitive processes, brain function, attachment, and dissociation  that support this theory are reviewed and discussed. Areas for future research  that might verify or refute this theory are suggested.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579405050558 PMID: 16613436 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Institute of Community and Family Psychiatry, SMBD-Jewish General Hospital,  4333 Chemin de la Cote Ste. Catherine, Montréal, Québec, Canada.  joel.paris@mcgill.ca	Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a broad pattern of  impulsivity and suicidality. BPD usually begins in adolescence; the full  clinical picture of the disorder is associated with developmental increases in  impulsivity. However, BPD also has childhood precursors. The developmental  pathways are similar to those found in other impulsive spectrum disorders, but  children who later develop BPD probably have both externalizing and  internalizing symptoms. Research in this area has made use of retrospective data  from adults, prospective data from community studies, follow-up studies from  children at risk, as well as research on "borderline pathology of childhood" (a  condition with symptoms similar to adult BPD). Existing evidence suggests that  both temperamental and environmental risk factors play a role in the development  of the behavioral patterns associated with the disorder. These pathways also  help account for the life course and outcome of BPD in adulthood.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579405050510 PMID: 16613432 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Rogosch FA(1), Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, NY 14608, USA.  rogosch@netacc.com	Potential precursors to borderline personality disorder (BPD) were investigated  in a sample of 185 maltreated and 175 nonmaltreated school-aged children  attending a summer camp research program. Self-report, peer-report, and  counselor-report measures were utilized to assess developmental constructs  conceptualized to constitute vulnerability for later emerging BPD. These areas,  including personality features, representational models of self, parent, and  peers, interpersonal relationship difficulties with peers and adults, and  suicidal/self-harm behavior, were used to develop a BPD precursors composite.  Additionally, the efficiency of three attention networks was assessed with a  computerized task. Maltreated children had higher mean scores on the BPD  precursors composite, and children classified as having high levels of these  precursors were more prevalent in the maltreatment group. No maltreatment group  differences were found for the efficiency of the three attention networks;  however, children with high levels of BPD precursors evinced less efficient  processing of the conflict attention network, comparable to findings observed  among adult patients with BPD. Child maltreatment and efficiency of the conflict  attention network independently predicted scores on the BPD precursors  composite. Experiential and biological contributions to risk for BPD and  recommendations for prevention and intervention are discussed.

Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, Institute of Child Development,  Minneapolis 55455, USA. crick001@umn.edu	Borderline personality disorder is a particularly devastating, yet understudied  form of psychopathology. One of the most significant gaps in existing knowledge  is the lack of systematic, prospective empirical attention to the developmental  precursors of borderline personality. The present investigation was an  exploratory attempt to address this limitation through (a) development of a  psychometrically sound self-report instrument that assesses borderline  personality features in childhood, the Borderline Personality Features Scale for  Children (BPFS-C); (b) examination of the stability of BPF in childhood; (c)  evaluation of gender differences in BPF in childhood; and (d) evaluation of the  specificity of the BPFS-C for assessing borderline personality features. These  goals were achieved through the prospective study of a normative sample of 400  (54% female) fourth though sixth graders who were assessed during the Fall of  Year 1, Spring of Year 1, and Fall of Year 2. The use of linear mixed modeling  techniques provided evidence for the construct validity of the BPFS-C. Further,  borderline personality features as assessed with the BPFS-C were found to be  moderately stable over the course of the study, with girls reporting higher  levels of BPF than boys. Results also demonstrated that children's scores on the  BPFS-C were uniquely related to indicators of borderline personality pathology  above and beyond their scores on the Children's Depression Inventory. The  implications of these results for the study of the development and etiology of  borderline pathology are discussed.	PMID: 16613430 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Fruzzetti AE(1), Shenk C, Hoffman PD.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology 298, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557, USA.  aef@unr.edu	Although no prospective epidemiological studies have evaluated the relationship  between family interactions and the development of borderline personality  disorder (BPD), there is considerable evidence for the central role of family  interactions in the development of BPD. This paper describes the role of family  interactions or processes, especially those that might be regarded as  invalidating or conflictual, negative or critical, and the absence of more  validating, positive, supportive, empathic interactions, in the development of  BPD. Perhaps more importantly, the proposed model considers how these parental  and family behaviors transact with the child's own behaviors and emotional  vulnerabilities, resulting in a developmental model of BPD that is neither  blaming of the family member with BPD nor of her or his parents and caregivers,  and has important and specific implications for both prevention and  intervention.

Author information: (1)Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge, Department of Psychiatry,  Cambridge, UK. og211@cam.ac.uk	This study evaluated Mind Reading, an interactive systematic guide to emotions,  for its effectiveness in teaching adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) and  high-functioning autism (HFA) to recognize complex emotions in faces and voices.  Experiment 1 tested a group of adults diagnosed with AS/HFA (n = 19) who used  the software at home for 10-15 weeks. Participants were tested on recognition of  faces and voices at three different levels of generalization. A matched control  group of adults with AS/HFA (n = 22) were assessed without any intervention. In  addition, a third group of general population controls (n = 24) was tested.  Experiment 2 repeated the design of Experiment 1 with a group of adults with  AS/HFA who used the software at home and met in a group with a tutor on a weekly  basis. They were matched to a control group of adults with AS/HFA attending  social skills training and to a general population control group (n = 13 for all  three groups). In both experiments the intervention group improved significantly  more than the control group on close, but not distant, generalization tasks.  Verbal IQ had significant effects in Experiment 2. Using Mind Reading for a  relatively short period of time allows users to learn to recognize a variety of  complex emotions and mental states. However, additional methods are required to  enhance generalization.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579406060305 PMID: 16600069 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Siebenbruner J(1), Englund MM, Egeland B, Hudson K.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, MN 55455, USA.	This longitudinal study examined antecedents of substance use behavior among 176  (53% male) adolescents. Adolescents were classified as (a) abstainers (n = 19),  (b) experimenters (n = 65), (c) at-risk youth (n = 63), and (d) abusers (n = 29)  based on their reported substance use behavior at age 17.5. Parental behavior,  peer competence, and problem behavior, measured from early childhood through age  16, were examined as predictors of substance use patterns. Multinomial logistic  regression models revealed that early maternal hostility, externalizing behavior  problems in first grade and at age 16, internalizing behavior in first grade and  at age 16, and parental monitoring at age 16 significantly differentiated  substance use groups. The study provides evidence that experiences occurring  early in development, in addition to those that occur later in development, can  play a pivotal role in setting the stage for late adolescent substance use  behavior.

Smith CL(1), Eisenberg N, Spinrad TL, Chassin L, Morris AS, Kupfer A, Liew J,  Cumberland A, Valiente C, Kwok OM.	Author information: (1)Arizona State University, USA. smithcl@vt.edu	The relations of children's coping strategies and coping efficacy to parent  socialization and child adjustment were examined in a sample of school-age  children that included families in which some of the grandparents and/or parents  had an alcoholism diagnosis. Parents and older children reported on the  children's coping strategies; parents reported on their parenting behavior; and  teachers reported on children's externalizing and internalizing problems.  Measures of parent socialization were associated with parents' and children's  reports of active coping strategies and parents' reports of both support-seeking  coping and coping efficacy. Some of these relations were moderated by familial  alcohol status. Children higher in parent-reported active/support-seeking coping  and coping efficacy were rated lower in teacher-reported externalizing and  internalizing adjustment problems. The findings were consistent with the view  that active/support-seeking coping and coping efficacy mediated the association  of parent socialization to children's psychological adjustment and that this  relation was sometimes moderated by parental alcohol status.

Author information: (1)School of Psychological Science, La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia.  c.dissanayake@latrobe.edu.au	Little effort has been made to characterize the developmental anatomic phenotype  of autism; although there is evidence of an increased head circumference and  brain size, few other physical characteristics have been studied. The head  circumference, body length/height, and weight measurements of infants, who were  later diagnosed with high-functioning autism (HFA, n = 16) and Asperger disorder  (AsD, n = 12), were extracted from health records over the first 3 years of life  and compared to the measurements of a matched normal control group (n = 19).  Using linear mixed-effects models, no differences were found in the average  growth rate for head circumference, stature, or weight between the children with  HFA and AsD. However, a significantly higher growth rate in body length/height  and weight was found for the combined group of children with HFA and AsD  compared to the normal control group. A trend toward higher growth rate in head  circumference was also found among the former group. The results indicate that  growth dysregulation in autism is not specific to the brain but also involves  growth in stature.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579406060202 PMID: 16600060 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA  94720, USA.	In 1990 we advanced the hypothesis that frightened and frightening (FR) parental  behavior would prove to be linked to both unresolved (U) adult attachment status  as identified in the Adult Attachment Interview and to infant  disorganized/disoriented (D) attachment as assessed in the Ainsworth Strange  Situation. Here, we present a coding system for identifying and scoring the  intensity of the three primary forms of FR behavior (frightened, threatening,  and dissociative) as well as three subsidiary forms. We review why each primary  form may induce fear of the parent (the infant's primary "haven of safety"),  placing the infant in a disorganizing approach-flight paradox. We suggest that,  being linked to the parent's own unintegrated traumatic experiences (often loss  or maltreatment), FR behaviors themselves are often guided by parental fright,  and parallel the three "classic" mammalian responses to fright: flight, attack,  and freezing behavior. Recent studies of U to FR, as well as FR to D relations  are presented, including findings regarding AMBIANCE/FR+. Links between  dissociation, FR, U, and D are explored. Parallel processing and working memory  are discussed as they relate to these phenomena.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579406060172 PMID: 16600057 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Interindividual differences in change were  found for Total Problems and Externalizing behavior but not for Internalizing.  While both the child's temperament and intelligence level and family relations  were related to the initial level of parent-rated problem behavior, only  intermediary stressful life events had an influence on the rate of change of  child psychopathology.

Author information: (1)Research Unit on Children's Psycho-Social Maladjustment, University of  Montréal, Boul, Quebec, Canada.	We tested three competing models regarding the role of deviant friends in the  trajectory linking early disruptiveness with later conduct problems through the  use of a preventive intervention program. The program was implemented during the  second and third grade. One model predicted that the program would positively  affect later conduct problems by facilitating nondeviant peer association during  early adolescence. The second model predicted a direct impact of the program on  later conduct problems through the reduction of early disruptiveness. The third  model predicted an interaction between postintervention disruptiveness and  association with less deviant friends. The results showed that the program's  effects on later conduct problems were mediated by the reduction in  disruptiveness and by the association with less deviant friends. However, the  positive effect of associating with less deviant friends depended on whether  children's disruptiveness had been reduced or not by their participation in the  program, thus supporting the third model. We recommend using intervention  studies to test developmental models.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579499002060 PMID: 16506535 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Graduate School of Education & Information Studies, University of California,  Los Angeles 90095-1521, USA. howes@gseis.ucla.edu	The purpose of this study was to use the Attachment Q-Set to create categories  of attachment organization that were conceptually consistent with organizational  categories derived from other attachment assessments, reliable, and valid. We  were particularly interested in creating categories that would describe insecure  attachment organizations in children from difficult life circumstances. Our  sample of relationships included 3062 teacher-child relationships. Children  ranged in age from toddlers to kindergartners and were diverse in ethnic  background. Two percent of the children were diagnosed with severe social and  emotional problems and enrolled in a therapeutic preschool. Sixteen percent were  enrolled in intervention programs on the basis of family poverty and another 34%  of the children attended subsidized child care programs for low-income children.  All of the children's child-teacher relationships were assessed with the  Attachment Q-Set (AQS). Independent observers observed or rated children's peer  play. Teachers completed behavior problem questionnaires and Student Teacher  Relationships Scales. Using the AQS we created five subscales and six attachment  organizational categories. These subscales and organizational categories were  associated in theoretically meaningful ways with measures of behavior problems,  social competence with peers, and teacher perceptions of child-teacher  relationship.

Disorganized attachment in early childhood: meta-analysis of precursors,  concomitants, and sequelae.	van Ijzendoorn MH(1), Schuengel C, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ.	Author information: (1)Center for Child and Family Studies, Leiden University, The Netherlands.  Vanijzen@rulfsw.leidenuniv.nl	During the past 10 years nearly 80 studies on disorganized attachment involving  more than 6,000 infant-parent dyads have been carried out. The current series of  meta-analyses have established the reliability and discriminant validity of  disorganized infant attachment. Although disorganized attachment behavior is  necessarily difficult to observe and often subtle, many researchers have managed  to become reliable coders. Furthermore, disorganized attachment shows modest  short- and long-term stability, in particular in middle class environments, and  it is not just a concomitant of constitutional, temperamental, or physical child  problems. The predictive validity of disorganized attachment is established in  terms of problematic stress management, the elevated risk of externalizing  problem behavior, and even the tendency of disorganized infants to show  dissociative behavior later in life. In normal, middle class families, about 15%  of the infants develop disorganized attachment behavior. In other social  contexts and in clinical groups this percentage may become twice or even three  times higher (e.g., in the case of maltreatment). Although the importance of  disorganized attachment for developmental psychopathology is evident, the search  for the mechanisms leading to disorganization has just started. Frightening  parental behavior may play an important role but it does not seem to be the only  causal factor involved in the emergence of disorganized attachment.

A group of 164 children from different infant temperament categories were seen  at 7 years of age for a laboratory battery that included behavioral and  physiological measurements. The major results indicated that children who had  been classified as high reactive infants at 4 months of age, compared with  infants classified as low reactive, (a) were more vulnerable to the development  of anxious symptoms at age 7 years, (b) were more subdued in their interactions  with a female examiner, (c) made fewer errors on a task requiring inhibition of  a reflex, and (d) were more reflective. Further, the high reactives who  developed anxious symptoms differed from the high reactives without anxious  symptoms with respect to fearful behavior in the second year and, at age 7  years, higher diastolic blood pressure, a narrower facial skeleton, and greater  magnitude of cooling of the temperature of the fingertips to cognitive  challenge. Finally, variation in magnitude of interference to fearful or  aggressive pictures on a modified Stroop procedure failed to differentiate  anxious from nonanxious or high from low reactive children.

Young adults from families characterized by parental  loss (N = 45) and control participants (N = 43) completed self-report measures  of prior abuse and family conflict, and performed a stressful speech task  designed to elicit neuroendocrine responses. Higher reported abuse and conflict  were associated with increased cortisol for the loss group, but were unrelated  to cortisol in the control group. Results indicate alterations in neuroendocrine  functioning associated with early parental loss, which are moderated by the  quality of the family environment.

O'Donnell DA(1), Schwab-Stone ME, Ruchkin V.	Author information: (1)St. Mary's College of Maryland, USA.	A study was conducted to determine predictors of high risk/delinquent behavior  and psychoemotional maladjustment in 1,478 sixth and eighth graders who took  part in a survey of high-risk and adaptive behaviors. The first goal was to  determine the extent to which two distinct dimensions of alienation,  normlessness, and isolation/self-estrangement mediated the emergence of  maladjustment in youth exposed to community violence. The second goal was to  distinguish between violence witnessing and violence victimization, and  determine whether these subtypes of violence exposure may differentially affect  the proposed mediational factors. The results indicated that normlessness  partially mediated the relationship between violence exposure and  high-risk/delinquent behavior and between violence exposure and psychoemotional  maladjustment. Isolation/self-estrangement partially mediated the relation  between violence exposure and psychoemotional maladjustment. Although witnessing  of, and victimization by, violence were both significant predictors of  normlessness, only violent victimization was significantly linked to  isolation/self-estrangement. These results elucidate the mechanisms by which  community violence exposure may exert negative influences on youth and suggest  that there are distinct patterns of risk associated with different forms of  exposure.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Virginia, Box 400400,  Charlottesville, VA 22904-4400, USA. allen@virginia.edu	Adolescents' susceptibility to peer influence was examined as a marker of  difficulties in the general process of autonomy development that was likely to  be related to deficits across multiple domains of psychosocial functioning. A  laboratory-based assessment of susceptibility to peer influence in interactions  with a close friend was developed and examined in relation to corollary reports  obtained from adolescents, their mothers, and close peers at ages 13 and 14. As  hypothesized, observed susceptibility to peer influence with a close friend  predicted future responses to negative peer pressure, but it was also related to  broader markers of problems in functioning, including decreases in popularity,  and increasing levels of depressive symptoms, over time. Susceptibility to peer  influence was also linked to higher concurrent levels of substance use,  externalizing behavior, and sexual activity. Results are interpreted as  reflecting the central role of establishing autonomy with peers in psychosocial  development.

Regression analyses indicated that physical victimization was  significantly related to cigarette and alcohol use but not to advanced alcohol  and marijuana use; relational victimization contributed uniquely to all  categories of drug use after controlling for physical victimization. Physical  victimization was also significantly related to physical and relational  aggression and delinquent behaviors, and relational victimization made a unique  contribution in the concurrent prediction of these behaviors. Physical  victimization was more strongly related to both categories of alcohol use,  aggression, and to delinquent behaviors among boys than among girls. In  contrast, relational victimization was more strongly related to physical  aggression and marijuana use among girls than among boys, but more strongly  related to relational aggression among boys than among girls. These findings  provide information about the generalizability of prior research and have  important implications for intervention efforts.

The circumplex model of affect: an integrative approach to affective  neuroscience, cognitive development, and psychopathology.	Posner J(1), Russell JA, Peterson BS.	Author information: (1)Columbia College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA.	The circumplex model of affect proposes that all affective states arise from  cognitive interpretations of core neural sensations that are the product of two  independent neurophysiological systems. This model stands in contrast to  theories of basic emotions, which posit that a discrete and independent neural  system subserves every emotion. We propose that basic emotion theories no longer  explain adequately the vast number of empirical observations from studies in  affective neuroscience, and we suggest that a conceptual shift is needed in the  empirical approaches taken to the study of emotion and affective  psychopathologies. The circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many  recent findings from behavioral, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, and  developmental studies of affect. Moreover, the model offers new theoretical and  empirical approaches to studying the development of affective disorders as well  as the genetic and cognitive underpinnings of affective processing within the  central nervous system.

Tucker DM(1), Luu P, Derryberry D.	Author information: (1)Electrical Geodesics, Inc., University of Oregon, Eugene 97403, USA.	Empathic concern for others is an essential motive for challenges of  self-regulation at all developmental stages. A child who never develops the  capacity for empathic concern may become an ineffective parent, such that  developmental psychopathology propagates across generations. We draw on evidence  and theory by Panksepp and associates that indicates that infant-mother bonding  is mediated by opiate mechanisms. We review the neural systems of pain  perception and find these are closely aligned with those for attentional and  cognitive self-regulation. Analysis of the limbic and neocortical  representations for interpersonal reasoning suggests there are important  contributions from visceral, affective, and somatic and cognitive levels. We  draw on modern learning theory to propose a critical role for frustration  training in development to allow the child to achieve the capacity for  tolerating psychological pain that allows effective empathic concern in later  relationships.

Neurocognitive and electrophysiological evidence of altered face processing in  parents of children with autism: implications for a model of abnormal  development of social brain circuitry in autism.	Dawson G(1), Webb SJ, Wijsman E, Schellenberg G, Estes A, Munson J, Faja S.	Author information: (1)University of Washington Autism Center and Center on Human Development and  Disability, Seattle 98195, USA.	Neuroimaging and behavioral studies have shown that children and adults with  autism have impaired face recognition. Individuals with autism also exhibit  atypical event-related brain potentials to faces, characterized by a failure to  show a negative component (N170) latency advantage to face compared to nonface  stimuli and a bilateral, rather than right lateralized, pattern of N170  distribution. In this report, performance by 143 parents of children with autism  on standardized verbal, visual-spatial, and face recognition tasks was examined.  It was found that parents of children with autism exhibited a significant  decrement in face recognition ability relative to their verbal and visual  spatial abilities. Event-related brain potentials to face and nonface stimuli  were examined in 21 parents of children with autism and 21 control adults.  Parents of children with autism showed an atypical event-related potential  response to faces, which mirrored the pattern shown by children and adults with  autism. These results raise the possibility that face processing might be a  functional trait marker of genetic susceptibility to autism. Discussion focuses  on hypotheses regarding the neurodevelopmental and genetic basis of altered face  processing in autism. A general model of the normal emergence of social brain  circuitry in the first year of life is proposed, followed by a discussion of how  the trajectory of normal development of social brain circuitry, including  cortical specialization for face processing, is altered in individuals with  autism. The hypothesis that genetic-mediated dysfunction of the dopamine reward  system, especially its functioning in social contexts, might account for altered  face processing in individuals with autism and their relatives is discussed.

An event-related potential study of the processing of affective facial  expressions in young children who experienced maltreatment during the first year  of life.	Cicchetti D(1), Curtis WJ.	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, USA.	This investigation examined the effects of maltreatment during the first year of  life on the neural correlates of processing facial expressions of emotion at 30  months of age. Event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to children passively  viewing standardized pictures of female models posing angry, happy, and neutral  facial expressions were examined. Four ERP waveform components were derived:  early negative (N150), early positive (P260), negative central (Nc), and  positive slow wave (PSW). Differences in these waveforms between a group of 35  maltreated and 24 nonmaltreated children were reported. The groups did not  differ on the early perceptual negative component (N150), whereas the maltreated  children had greater P260 amplitude at frontal leads compared to the  nonmaltreated children in response to viewing angry facial expressions. For the  Nc component, the nonmaltreated comparison children exhibited greater amplitude  while viewing pictures of happy faces compared to angry and neutral faces,  whereas the maltreated children showed greater Nc amplitude at central sites  while viewing angry faces. For the PSW, the nonmaltreated group showed a greater  area score in the right hemisphere in response to viewing angry facial  expressions compared to the maltreated group. The results are discussed in terms  of brain development and function, as well as their implications for the design  and evaluation of preventive interventions.

Developmental trajectories of offending: validation and prediction to young  adult alcohol use, drug use, and depressive symptoms.	Wiesner M(1), Kim HK, Capaldi DM.	Author information: (1)University of Alabama, Birmingham, Center for the Advancement of Youth  Health, 912 Building, 1530 3rd Avenue South, Birmingham, AL 35294-1200, USA.  mwiesner@uab.edu	This longitudinal study extended previous work of Wiesner and Capaldi by  examining the validity of differing offending pathways and the prediction from  the pathways to substance use and depressive symptoms for 204 young men.  Findings from this study indicated good external validity of the offending  trajectories. Further, substance use and depressive symptoms in young adulthood  (i.e., ages 23-24 through 25-26 years) varied depending on different  trajectories of offending from early adolescence to young adulthood (i.e., ages  12-13 through 23-24 years), even after controlling for antisocial propensity,  parental criminality, demographic factors, and prior levels of each outcome.  Specifically, chronic high-level offenders had higher levels of depressive  symptoms and engaged more often in drug use compared with very rare, decreasing  low-level, and decreasing high-level offenders. Chronic low-level offenders, in  contrast, displayed fewer systematic differences compared with the two  decreasing offender groups and the chronic high-level offenders. The findings  supported the contention that varying courses of offending may have plausible  causal effects on young adult outcomes beyond the effects of an underlying  propensity for crime.

Author information: (1)Center for Family Research, University of Georgia, 1095 College Station Road,  Athens, GA 30602-4527, USA. gbrody@uga.edu	A longitudinal model that linked involved-supportive parenting and siblings'  ability-camouflaging self-presentations to peers with the development of  externalizing and internalizing symptoms was tested with 152 pairs of first- and  second-born African American siblings (mean ages 12.7 years and 10.2 years at  the first wave of data collection). Three waves of data were collected at 1-year  intervals. Teachers assessed siblings' externalizing symptoms, internalizing  symptoms, and academic competence; siblings reported their own  self-presentations and desire for peer acceptance; and mothers and siblings  provided multiinformant assessments of involved-supportive parenting.  Involved-supportive parenting at Wave 1 was linked with peer-directed  self-presentations at Wave 2. Wave 2 self-presentations were linked indirectly  with changes from Wave 1 to Wave 3 in externalizing and internalizing symptoms  through their association with academic competence.

Shankman SA(1), Tenke CE, Bruder GE, Durbin CE, Hayden EP, Klein DN.	Author information: (1)Stony Brook University, NY 11794-2500, USA.	Low positive emotionality (PE; e.g., listlessness, anhedonia, and lack of  enthusiasm) has been hypothesized to be a temperamental precursor or risk factor  for depression. The present study sought to evaluate the validity of this  hypothesis by testing whether low PE children have similar external correlates  as individuals with depression. This paper focused on the external correlate of  EEG asymmetry. Previous studies have reported that individuals at risk for  depression exhibited a frontal EEG asymmetry (greater right than left activity).  Others have reported an association with posterior asymmetries (greater left  than right activity). In the present study, children classified as having low PE  at age 3 exhibited an overall asymmetry at age 5-6 with less relative activity  in the right hemisphere. This asymmetry appeared to be largely due to a  difference in the posterior region because children with low PE exhibited  decreased right posterior activity whereas high PE children exhibited no  posterior asymmetry. These findings support the construct validity of the  hypothesis that low PE may be a temperamental precursor or risk factor for  depression.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, 3720 Walnut Street,  Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. srjaffee@psych.upenn.edu	Maltreatment places children at risk for psychiatric morbidity, especially  conduct problems. However, not all maltreated children develop conduct problems.  We tested whether the effect of physical maltreatment on risk for conduct  problems was strongest among those who were at high genetic risk for these  problems using data from the E-risk Study, a representative cohort of 1,116  5-year-old British twin pairs and their families. Children's conduct problems  were ascertained via parent and teacher interviews. Physical maltreatment was  ascertained via parent report. Children's genetic risk for conduct problems was  estimated as a function of their co-twin's conduct disorder status and the  pair's zygosity. The effect of maltreatment on risk for conduct problems was  strongest among those at high genetic risk. The experience of maltreatment was  associated with an increase of 2% in the probability of a conduct disorder  diagnosis among children at low genetic risk for conduct disorder but an  increase of 24% among children at high genetic risk. Prediction of behavioral  pathology can attain greater accuracy if both pathogenic environments and  genetic risk are ascertained. Certain genotypes may promote resistance to  trauma. Physically maltreated children whose first-degree relatives engage in  antisocial behavior warrant priority for therapeutic intervention.

Developmental trajectories and ecological transitions: a two-step procedure to  aid in the choice of prevention and promotion interventions.	Seidman E(1), French SE.	Author information: (1)William T Grant Foundation, New York, NY 10022, USA. eseidman@wtgrantfdn.org	The confluence of two different types of transitional processes is explored:  human development and normative ecological transitions. There are periods of  greater vulnerability than others in the developmental life course as well as  particular normative ecological transitions that are more disruptive than  others. When there is a confluence of developmental vulnerability and a  disruptive ecological transition, a "turning point" in development may ensue.  This can take the form of an opportunity for growth and development or a  developmental mismatch. Consequently, such turning points may represent  opportune times and places at which to launch prevention/promotion programs. A  two-step analytic procedure, nomothetic analyses followed by idiographic  analyses, is described and illustrated to test the utility of this framework.  First, these issues are illustrated using the self-esteem trajectories of  low-income, urban public school students making a normative school transition to  a junior and senior high school. Second, new data are presented on the early  adolescent self-esteem trajectories and their association with long-term  psychopathology. Third, the significance of this two-step procedure is discussed  in regard to several normative ecological transitions that are common when older  adolescents make the developmental transition into adulthood (e.g., into  full-time employment, marriage).

Developmental properties of transactional models: the case of life events and  mastery from adolescence to young adulthood.	Shanahan MJ(1), Bauer DJ.	Author information: (1)Department of Sociology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel  Hill, NC 27599, USA. mjshan@unc.edu	That behavior reflects ongoing transactions between person and context is an  enshrined proposition of developmental theory, although the dynamic properties  of these transactions have not been fully appreciated. In this article, we focus  on reciprocal links between the Pearlin mastery scale and life events in the  transition to adulthood, a strategic relationship given that control  orientations are thought to mediate links between stressors and a range of  indicators of distress, and given that life events become increasingly likely in  young adulthood. Drawing on 12 waves of data from the Youth Development Study,  spanning ages 14-15 to 26-27, we examine a series of growth curve models that  interrelate mastery and life events. Results for females reveal that mastery  during the senior year of high school predicts life events for the following  4-year period, which in turn predicts mastery over the 5-year period spanning  ages 21-22 to 26-27. For males, mastery during the senior year (and perhaps the  sophomore year) predicts subsequent life events, which in turn have short-term  implications for mastery. Thus, transactions between life events and mastery are  observed, although the temporal patterns of these exchanges are complex. These  findings are discussed in terms of the developmental properties of transactions  between person and context.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579404040155 PMID: 15704829 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical  School, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. stouthamerloeberm@msx.upmc.edu	Many delinquent youth stop offending sometime in late adolescence or early  adulthood. However, little is known about individual differences in desistance  and which factors promote or inhibit desistance. In the current study, young  males in the oldest sample of the Pittsburgh Youth Study were followed from ages  13 to 25. About one-third became persistent serious delinquents between ages 13  and 19. Out of that group, almost 40% desisted in serious offending between ages  20 and 25. Significantly more of the desisters, compared to the persisters in  serious delinquency, had been employed or in school. Bivariate analyses  demonstrated many predictors of desistance of serious delinquency in early  adulthood in the domains of individual, family, and peer factors measured from  early adolescence onward. Multiple regression analyses showed that the following  promotive factors were associated with desistance: low physical punishment by  parents in early adolescence and being employed or in school in early adulthood.  The following risk factors were inversely associated with desistance during  early adulthood: serious delinquency during late adolescence, hard drug use,  gang membership, and positive perception of problem behavior in early adulthood.  The article discusses the implications of promotive and risk factors for  preventive interventions.	PMID: 15704820 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Sameroff AJ(1), Peck SC, Eccles JS.	Author information: (1)University of Michigan, USA. sameroff@umich.edu	Changes in conduct problems from middle school through early adulthood were  examined in a sample of 1191 African American and White males and females.  Predictors were selected from a number of ecological contexts to examine the  relative contribution of family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors to  conduct problems during the 7th, 8th, and 11th grade and across transitions in  middle school, into high school, and into young adulthood. Almost all contexts  made a unique contribution to conduct problems except for the neighborhood  setting. The variables that had the most regular influences during each of these  periods were Family Consistent Control, Family Discipline Harshness, and  Negative Peers. Positive family and positive peer variables had less consistent  relations to outcomes. School variables were more influential in middle school  than later. Few gender or race differences were found in the patterning of  predictors across time. Studies using only one or two settings as predictors of  conduct problems, may provide a misleading picture of their impact by excluding  other contextual influences.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri-Columbia,  Columbia, MO 65211, USA. sherk@missouri.edu	Developmental psychopathologists are increasingly focused on characterizing  heterogeneity of trajectories of psychological disorders across the life course  (e.g., developmentally limited vs. chronic forms of disorder). Although the  developmental significance of trajectories has been highlighted, there has been  little attention to relations between trajectories and their etiologically and  clinically relevant time-varying covariates (dynamic predictors). Depending upon  the functional relation between a disorder and a dynamic predictor, we expect to  see different trajectories of dynamic predictors. Thus, we propose a taxonomy of  trajectories of dynamic predictors of course of disorder and provide an initial  investigation into its validity. Using a mixed-gender, high-risk sample of young  adults followed over 7 years, we identified dynamic predictors that covary with  the course of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Based on a logically derived  classification to facilitate interpretation of findings, three comparison groups  were examined: persons whose AUD "remitted" (n = 33), those with a chronic AUD  (n = 29), and nondiagnosers (n = 274). We hypothesized seven patterns of dynamic  prediction (stable vulnerability indicators, course trackers, deterioration  markers, developmentally specific variables, developmental lag markers,  course-referenced variables, and recovery behaviors) and found evidence for five  of them. The interpretation of markers of risk for development and course of  AUDs and their implications for prevention, early intervention and  formal/self-change treatments are discussed.

Margolin G(1), Gordis EB, Oliver PH.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, SGM 930, University of Southern California, Los  Angeles, CA 90089-1061, USA. margolin@usc.edu	The present study examined how marital conflict may compromise parenting by  identifying interdependencies across marital and parent-child subsystems in a  sample of 86 two-parent families with a child aged 9-13. The study used direct  observation of three family discussions to examine interdependencies across  family subsystems. The study also assessed whether a history of husband-to-wife  aggression strengthened interdependencies. Overall, families with  husband-to-wife aggression showed a negative tone that pervaded throughout the  family. Consistent with theories about physically aggressive men tending to  withdraw from conflict, fathers who had engaged in husband-to-wife aggression  showed an association between marital hostilities and lower levels of empathy  toward their children. Consistent with stress theories, women who had been  exposed to husband-to-wife aggression showed a link between marital hostilities  and negative affect when interacting with their children. These findings  illustrate how a history of exposure to marital aggression can create a family  environment of multiple risks for children. For children in families with prior  marital aggression, ongoing marital hostilities can be linked to the additional  risk of erosions in parental support.

Support was found for a mediational model, such that family  functioning was found to mediate the relationship between marital power dynamics  and children's internalizing and externalizing behavior. Some support also was  found for ethnicity as a moderator of the association between systemic family  processes and children's adjustment. Disturbances in family cohesion and  subsystem boundaries were more strongly related to internalizing symptomatology  for children in European American families compared to children in Hispanic  American families.

One such cornerstone of structural  and strategic family therapy is the family hierarchy. The present study  investigated both the development of hierarchical structure in families from  infancy to late middle childhood and relations between strong hierarchical  structure and children's conduct problems. Using structural equation modeling,  direct pathways to low hierarchical structure were evident for early caregiving  behavior and parent-child conflict, with indirect associations present for  parental adjustment, marital functioning, negative child behavior, and  ecological disadvantage. In turn, family hierarchies were associated with youth  antisocial behavior, an effect that was moderated by ethnic and neighborhood  context. The results are discussed in reference to family systems' theory and  implications for prevention and intervention.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579404004638 PMID: 15605622 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Meyer SE(1), Carlson GA, Wiggs EA, Martinez PE, Ronsaville DS, Klimes-Dougan B,  Gold PW, Radke-Yarrow M.	Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, USA. semeyer@mednet.ucla.edu	Studies of adults who have been diagnosed with, and treated for, bipolar  disorder have shown that these patients exhibit impairment on measures of  executive functioning. However, it is unclear whether executive dysfunction  precedes the diagnosis of bipolar illness, or develops subsequent to its onset.  Moreover, investigators have failed to control for the effects of premorbid  attentional problems on cognitive performance in these patients. The present  authors explored these questions using data from a longitudinal prospective  study of individuals at risk for major mood disorder. Results revealed that 67%  of participants who met criteria for bipolar disorder in young adulthood showed  impairment on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) when they were assessed  during adolescence, as compared with 17% of individuals with no major mood  diagnosis, and 19% with unipolar depression. This association between  performance on the WCST and bipolar illness was not accounted for by high rates  of premorbid attentional disturbance. In fact, among participants with early  attentional problems, only those who ultimately developed bipolar disorder  exhibited impairment on the WCST. Early attentional problems that preceded  unipolar depression or no mood disorder were not associated with executive  dysfunction.	DOI: 10.1017/s095457940404461x PMID: 15487606 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Alexander GM(1), Peterson BS.	Author information: (1)Texas A&M University, Department of Psychology, College Station, 77843, USA.  gma@psyc.tamu.edu	The hypothesis that prenatal masculinization of the brain increases risk of tic  disorders in postnatal life was tested by measuring gender and gender role  behavior in 89 children and adults with a clinical diagnosis of Tourette  syndrome or obsessive compulsive disorder and 67 healthy, unaffected children  and adults. Consistent with this hypothesis, a tic disorder in females was  associated with more gender dysphoria, increased masculine play preferences, and  a more typically "masculine" pattern of performance on two sex-typed spatial  tasks. Males with tic disorders reported increased masculine play preferences,  and the strength of these preferences was positively associated with the  severity of tic symptoms. In addition, unlike their female counterparts, males  with tic disorders showed a relative impairment in mental rotation ability.  These behavioral profiles are consistent with those of children who have  verifiable elevations in prenatal androgen levels. These findings therefore  support the hypothesis that an altered androgen-dependent process of sexual  differentiation during prenatal life may contribute to the development of  tic-related disorders.

Author information: (1)Johns Hopkins University, USA. dschultz@umbc.edu	We examined the relations between emotionality, emotion processing, and  aggression in 182 first- and second-grade children. Consistent with Tomkins' and  Izard's theoretical predictions, emotionality correlated with emotion  processing. In particular, the happiness component of emotionality correlated  with emotion attribution accuracy and empathy, the anger component correlated  with anger attribution bias and empathy, and the fear component correlated with  fear attribution bias. Multiple emotion processing deficits--including emotion  attribution accuracy, anger attribution bias, and self-report of empathy--placed  children at risk for heightened levels of teacher-reported aggression.  Mediational analyses revealed that an emotion processing risk index fit a model  of significant partial mediation between happiness and aggression but not  between anger and aggression. The results suggest the multifaceted manner in  which children's emotion experiences may influence the development of aggressive  tendencies.

Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, NY 14608, USA.  mhfc@netacc.net	False belief understanding was investigated in maltreated (N = 203), low  socioeconomic status (SES) nonmaltreated (N = 143), and middle SES nonmaltreated  (N = 172) 3- to 8-year-old children. Contrasts among the three groups provided  an opportunity to examine the impact of family contextual influences on theory  of mind development. Specifically, child maltreatment served as an "experiment  of nature" in order to elucidate theory of mind abilities. Two false belief  tasks and language assessments were administered. Among children with a verbal  mental age of 49 months or greater, maltreatment was related to delays in the  development of theory of mind, beyond the influence of chronological age and  SES. The occurrence of maltreatment during the toddler period, onset during the  toddler years, and physical abuse were features of maltreatment associated with  delay in the development of theory of mind. Findings are discussed in terms of  the influence of harsh caregiving on the development of theory of mind.  Implications for the understanding of normal developmental processes are  highlighted.

Author information: (1)University of Oregon, Child and Family Center, USA.  isabela.granic@sickkids.ca	A survey of dynamic systems (DS) methods appropriate for testing systems-based  models in developmental psychopathology is provided. The rationale for  developing new methods for the field is reviewed first. In line with other  scholars, we highlight the fundamental incompatibility between  developmentalists' organismic, open systems models and the mechanistic research  methods with which these models are tested. Key DS principles are explained and  their commensurability with developmental psychopathologists' core theoretical  concerns are discussed. Next, a survey of research designs and methodological  techniques currently being used and refined by developmental DS researchers is  provided. The strengths and limitations of each approach are discussed  throughout this review. Finally, we elaborate on one specific dynamic systems  method, state space grids, which addresses many of the limitations of previous  DS techniques and may prove most useful for the discipline. This approach was  developed as a middle road between DS methods that are mathematically heavy on  the one hand and purely descriptive on the other. Examples of developmental and  clinical studies that have applied state space grids are reviewed and  suggestions for future analyses are made. We conclude with some implications for  the application of this new methodology for studying change processes in  clinical research.

Curran PJ(1), Willoughby MT.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,  27599-3270, USA. curran@unc.edu	The field of developmental psychopathology is faced with a dual challenge. On  the one hand, we must build interdisciplinary theoretical models that adequately  reflect the complexity of normal and abnormal human development over time. On  the other hand, to remain a viable empirical science, we must rigorously  evaluate these theories using statistical methods that fully capture this  complexity. The degree to which our statistical models fail to correspond to our  theoretical models undermines our ability to validly test developmental theory.  The broad class of random coefficient trajectory (or growth curve) models allow  us to test our theories in ways not previously possible. Despite these  advantages, there remain certain limits with regard to the types of questions  these models can currently evaluate. We explore these issues through the pursuit  of three goals. First, we provide an overview of a variety of trajectory models  that can be used for rigorously testing many hypotheses in developmental  psychopathology. Second, we highlight what types of research questions are well  tested using these methods and what types of questions currently are not. Third,  we describe areas for future statistical development and encourage the ongoing  interchange between developmental theory and quantitative methodology.

Depressive symptoms across adolescence and young adulthood in men: predictions  from parental and contextual risk factors.	Kim HK(1), Capaldi DM, Stoolmiller M.	Author information: (1)Oregon Social Learning Center, Eugene 97401, USA. hyounk@oslc.org	The current study examined the course of depressive symptoms of young men from  early adolescence through young adulthood using a growth model approach and the  influence of early parental (i.e.,depressive symptoms, antisocial behaviors,  substance use) and contextual (i.e., family income and parental marital  transitions) risk factors on both the level of depressive symptoms in early  adolescence and on changes over a 10-year period, controlling for young men's  early antisocial behavior. On average, depressive symptoms of the youths tended  to decrease slightly as they reached young adulthood. Among the parental and  contextual risk factors, parent's marital transitions was the most significant  predictor for the level of depressive symptoms in early adolescence. Parent's  marital transitions and family income were also significantly related to changes  in depressive symptoms. As hypothesized, there was a significant interaction  effect of paternal and maternal depressive symptoms on depressive symptoms in  early adolescence and on changes over time. Maternal depressive symptoms were  related to the son's depressive symptoms only when the father's depressive  symptoms were also high. The results also suggested that parenting practices did  not mediate the effects of the parental and contextual risk factors on the  development of depressive symptoms among young men.

Eley TC(1), Lichtenstein P, Moffitt TE.	Author information: (1)Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Research Centre, Institute of  Psychiatry, King's College London, UK. t.eley@iop.kcl.ac.uk	Developmental studies of antisocial behavior (ASB) have found two subgroups of  behaviors, roughly described as aggressive and nonaggressive ASB. Theoretical  accounts predict that aggressive ASB, which shows greater stability, should have  high heritability. In contrast, nonaggressive ASB is very common in adolescence,  shows less continuity, and should be influenced both by genes and shared  environment. This study explored the genetic and environmental influences on  aggressive and nonaggressive ASB in over 1,000 twin pairs aged 8-9 years and  again at 13-14 years. Threshold models were fit to the data to incorporate the  skew. In childhood, aggressive ASB was highly heritable and showed little  influence of shared environment, whereas nonaggressive ASB was significantly  influenced both by genes and shared environment. In adolescence, both variables  were influenced both by genes and shared envirnmment. The continuity in  aggressive antisocial behavior symptoms from childhood to adolescence was  largely mediated by genetic influences, whereas continuity in nonaggressive  antisocial behavior was mediated both by the shared environment and genetic  influences. These data are in agreement with the hypothesis that aggressive ASB  is a stable heritable trait as compared to nonaggressive behavior, which is more  strongly influenced by the environment and shows less genetic stability over  time.

Koenen KC(1), Moffitt TE, Caspi A, Taylor A, Purcell S.	Author information: (1)National Child Traumatic Stress Network, Department of Child & Adolescent  Psychiatry, Boston University Medical Center, MA 02118, USA.	Research suggests that exposure to extreme stress in childhood, such as domestic  violence, affects children's neurocognitive development, leading to lower  intelligence. But studies have been unable to account for genetic influences  that might confound the association between domestic violence and lower  intelligence. This twin study tested whether domestic violence had  environmentally mediated effects on young children's intelligence. Children's  IQs were assessed for a population sample of 1116 monozygotic and dizygotic  5-year-old twin pairs in England. Mothers reported their experience of domestic  violence in the previous 5 years. Ordinary least squares regression showed that  domestic violence was uniquely associated with IQ suppression in a dose-response  relationship. Children exposed to high levels of domestic violence had IQs that  were, on average, 8 points lower than unexposed children. Structural equation  models showed that adult domestic violence accounted for 4% of the variation, on  average, in child IQ, independent of latent genetic influences. The findings are  consistent with animal experiments and human correlational studies documenting  the harmful effects of extreme stress on brain development Programs that  successfully reduce domestic violence should also have beneficial effects on  children's cognitive development.

Author information: (1)Psychology Department, St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova  Scotia, Canada. abigelow@stfx.ca	There is little documentation of how and when joint attention emerges in blind  infants because the study of this ability has been predominantly reliant on  visual information. Ecological self-knowledge, which is necessary for joint  attention, is impaired in blind infants and is evidenced by their reaching for  objects on external cues, which also marks the beginning of their Stage 4  understanding of space and object. Entry into Stage 4 should occur before joint  attention emerges in these infants. In a case study of two totally blind  infants, the development of joint attention was longitudinally examined during  Stage 4 in monthly sessions involving interactions with objects and familiar  adults. The interactions were scored for behavior preliminary to joint  attention, behavior liberally construed as joint attention, and behavior  conservatively construed as joint attention. Behavior preliminary to joint  attention occurred throughout Stage 4: behavior suggestive of joint attention by  both liberal and conservative standards emerged initially in Stage 4 and became  prevalent by mid to late Stage 4. The findings are discussed in terms of how  they inform our thinking about the development of joint attention with respect  to the importance of vision, cognition, social context, language, and early  self-knowledge.

Buckner JC(1), Mezzacappa E, Beardslee WR.	Author information: (1)Harvard Medical School, Department of Psychiatry, Children's Hospital,  Boston, MA 02115, USA. john.buckner@tch.harvard.edu	As part of a larger investigation of very low income families, this study  examined the characteristics that differentiated resilient from nonresilient  school-age youths, with a focus on self-regulation (e.g., executive function,  emotion regulation) skills. Resilience was operationally defined in a robust and  comprehensive manner using well-established instruments that measured children's  emotional well-being and mental health. Controlling for other explanatory  variables, including differences in the experience of negative life events and  chronic strains, resilient youths were notably different from nonresilient  youths in terms of having greater self-regulatory skills and self-esteem, as  well as in receiving more active parental monitoring. Study findings are  discussed with regard to the theoretical framework of self-regulation and their  implications for preventive intervention.

Differences in assertive speech acts produced by children with autism, Asperger  syndrome, specific language impairment, and normal development.	Ziatas K(1), Durkin K, Pratt C.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, The University of Western Australia, Crawley.  kathy@psy.uwa.edu.au	The assertive speech acts of children with autism (n = 12) and Asperger syndrome  (n = 12), individually matched to children with specific language impairment  (SLI; n = 24) and children with normal development (n = 24) were studied in the  context of gently structured conversation. These children also completed the  false belief test of theory of mind. The children with autism used significantly  lower proportions of assertions involving explanations and descriptions than the  children with SLI or normal development and significantly lower proportions of  assertions involving internal state and explanations than the children with  Asperger syndrome. The children with autism used a higher proportion of  assertions involving identifications than any other group. The assertions of the  children with Asperger syndrome were generally not different than those of the  children with SLI or normal development except for a higher proportion of  assertions involving own internal state. Further analysis of the mental  assertions revealed that the children with autism and Asperger syndrome  predominantly referred to desire and made few references to thought and belief,  whereas the children with SLI and those with normal development used a higher  proportion of references to thought and belief.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park  16802, USA.	Mutual regulation of anger plays a role in both healthy adjustment and mental  health problems. This study of 85 preschooler boys and girls examined  mother-preschooler anger regulation during a frustration in relation to the  child's preschool and school age problem status. Less mutual positive emotion,  more mutual anger, and more emotional mismatches than other dyads characterized  dyads with a stable conduct problem child. Maternal emotion predicted school age  conduct problems, particularly for boys. Maternal emotion also predicted  stability versus improvement of symptoms. The emotional dynamics of  mother-preschooler angry exchanges may redirect girls' conduct problems and may  contribute to the stability of boys' conduct problems.	PMID: 12848432 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Using the Fast Track randomized prevention trial to test the early-starter model  of the development of serious conduct problems.	Bierman KL, Coie JD, Dodge KA, Greenberg MT, Lochman JE, McMahon RJ,  Pinderhughes EE; Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group.	The Fast Track prevention trial was used to test hypotheses from the  Early-Starter Model of the development of chronic conduct problems. We randomly  assigned 891 high-risk first-grade boys and girls (51% African American) to  receive the long-term Fast Track prevention or not. After 4 years, outcomes were  assessed through teacher ratings, parent ratings, peer nominations, and child  self-report. Positive effects of assignment to intervention were evident in  teacher and parent ratings of conduct problems, peer social preference scores,  and association with deviant peers. Assessments of proximal goals of  intervention (e.g., hostile attributional bias, problem-solving skill, harsh  parental discipline, aggressive and prosocial behavior at home and school)  collected after grade 3 were found to partially mediate these effects. The  findings are interpreted as consistent with developmental theory.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579402004133 PMCID: PMC2775439 PMID: 12549710 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The relative efficacy of two interventions in altering maltreated preschool  children's representational models: implications for attachment theory.	Toth SL(1), Maughan A, Manly JT, Spagnola M, Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, NY 14608, USA.  s.toth@worldnet.att.net	A narrative story-stem task was used to evaluate the efficacy of two competing,  developmentally informed preventive interventions for maltreated preschoolers  and their mothers designed to modify children's internal representations of self  and of self in relation to other. One hundred and twenty-two mothers and their  preschoolers (87 maltreated and 35 nonmaltreated) served as participants.  Maltreating families were randomly assigned to either the preschooler-parent  psychotherapy (PPP, n = 23), psychoeducational home visitation (PHV, n = 34), or  community standard (CS, n = 30) intervention group at baseline. Thirty-five  nonmaltreating (NC) families served as comparisons. Narratives were administered  to children at baseline and at the postintervention evaluation. Children in the  PPP intervention evidenced more of a decline in maladaptive maternal  representations over time than PHV and CS children and displayed a greater  decrease in negative self-representations than CS, PHV, and NC children. Also,  the mother-child relationship expectations of PPP children became more positive  over the course of the intervention, as compared to NC and PHV participants.  These results suggest that an attachment-theory informed model of intervention  (PPP) is more effective at improving representations of self and of caregivers  than is a didactic model of intervention directed at parenting skills. Findings  are discussed with respect to their implications for developmental theory, with  a specific focus on attachment theory and internal working models of  relationships.

Noam GG(1), Hermann CA.	Author information: (1)Harvard University, USA.	There is growing recognition that traditional strategies, such as pullout  special education programs and on-site casework and guidance, are no longer  sufficient to address the staggering needs of a growing number of troubled  children entering U.S. schools. This paper introduces a school-based prevention  and intervention method for young adolescents called Responsive Advocacy for  Life and Learning in Youth (RALLY). Prevention practitioners, a new role  developed by the program, work in classrooms and after-school settings to  provide nonstigmatizing support to students. Using a three-tiered prevention  model, practitioners integrate a mental health and educational focus to foster  students' academic, social, and emotional success. The intervention involves all  children of an age cohort in middle schools. The practitioners are developmental  specialists who create relationships with youth, teachers, and families in  high-risk environments and serve triage functions to existing community and  health care institutions. The RALLY intervention builds on normative  developmental and developmental psychopathology theory, especially a risk and  resilience framework. The paper describes the principles behind the practice and  how the work in this field has created innovations in theory and a new impetus  for research.

Hinshaw SP(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley 94720-1650, USA.  hinshaw@socrates.berkeley.edu	Intervention research with children and adolescents has suffered from a dearth  of relevant theoretical grounding and from the lack of a reciprocal "feedback"  mechanism by which clinical trials can inform relevant theorizing and  conceptualization. There are hopeful signs, however, of increasing confluence  between clinical efforts and theoretical models. Indeed, the key issue I discuss  is how intervention studies can yield information about developmental and  clinical theory as well as mechanisms related to psychopathology. Specific  research examples in the field, particularly those emanating from the Multimodal  Treatment Study of Children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (MTA  study), reveal that probes of moderator and mediator variables can clearly  enhance our knowledge of relevant processes and mechanisms. In fact, recent MTA  findings have relevance for models of genetic and epigenetic influence on  symptomatology related to attentional deficits and hyperactivity. It would be  overzealous, however, to make premature claims regarding etiologic variables  from intervention research, as treatment studies typically address variables  that are causally far "downstream" from primary causal factors and most clinical  trials have statistical power that is barely sufficient for main outcome  questions, much less mediational linkages. Overall, the field has severely  underutilized experimental intervention research to subserve the dual ends of  improving the lives of youth and advancing theoretical conceptualization  regarding development and psychopathology.

Izard CE(1), Fine S, Mostow A, Trentacosta C, Campbell J.	Author information: (1)Psychology Department, University of Delaware, Newark 19716, USA.  izard@udel.edu	We present an analysis of the role of emotions in normal and abnormal  development and preventive intervention. The conceptual framework stems from  three tenets of differential emotions theory (DET). These principles concern the  constructs of emotion utilization; intersystem connections among modular emotion  systems, cognition, and action; and the organizational and motivational  functions of discrete emotions. Particular emotions and patterns of emotions  function differentially in different periods of development and in influencing  the cognition and behavior associated with different forms of psychopathology.  Established prevention programs have not emphasized the concept of emotion as  motivation. It is even more critical that they have generally neglected the idea  of modulating emotions, not simply to achieve self-regulation, but also to  utilize their inherently adaptive functions as a means of facilitating the  development of social competence and preventing psychopathology. The paper  includes a brief description of a theory-based prevention program and  suggestions for complementary targeted interventions to address specific  externalizing and internalizing problems. In the final section, we describe ways  in which emotion-centered preventions can provide excellent opportunities for  research on the development of normal and abnormal behavior.

Author information: (1)Institute of Human Development, University of California, Berkeley  94720-1690, USA. pcowan@socrates.berkeley.edu	This paper addresses the role of family-based studies of preventive and  therapeutic interventions in our understanding of normal development and  psychopathology. The emphasis is on interventions designed to improve  parent-child and/or marital relationships as a way of facilitating development  and reducing psychopathology in children and adolescents. Intervention designs  provide the gold standard for testing causal hypotheses. We begin by discussing  the complexity of validating these hypotheses and the implications of the shift  from a traditional emphasis on theories of etiology to developmental  psychopathology's newer paradigm describing risks --> pathways --> outcomes. We  summarize correlational studies that document the fact that difficult and  ineffective parent-child and marital relationships function as risk factors for  children's cognitive, social, and emotional problems in childhood and  adolescence. We then review prevention studies and therapy evaluation studies  that establish some specific parenting and marital variables as causal risk  factors with respect to these outcomes. Our discussion focuses on what  intervention studies have revealed so far and suggests an agenda for further  research.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579402004054 PMID: 12549702 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Post RM(1), Weiss SR.	Author information: (1)National Institute of Mental Health/BPB, Bethesda, MD 20892-1272, USA.	In the authors' experience interactions between clinical and laboratory research  have been greatly mutually facilitatory in the understanding and development of  new treatments for the major mental illnesses. Examples in the literature are  also highlighted to show how cross-disciplinary studies are important in  understanding the subtle interactions of genetic and environmental mechanisms in  psychiatric illness. Yet, the results of some current science policies  encouraging project focus and superspecialization can lead to the separation of  clinical and basic investigators, which threatens the integration of  psychological complexity into the neurobiology of psychiatry at both a molecular  and behavioral level. This paper endorses renewed effort toward the  multidisciplinary team approach under the leadership of a physician-scientist in  order to better integrate many fields of study critical to ameliorating the  effects of psychiatric illness.

In this paper, we review recent  studies that have attempted to reveal the underlying causes of autism using a  variety of techniques. Particular emphasis is placed on techniques that have  been used by a number of different laboratories, including structural magnetic  resonance imaging and postmortem studies of neuroanatomy. Neurobiological and  neuropsychological data from individuals across a wide age range are examined  from a neurodevelopmental perspective. We discuss how these recent advances have  led us to develop a growth dysregulation hypothesis of autism. Finally, we  discuss how this hypothesis may lead to new innovations in autism research.

Author information: (1)OB/GYN, University of Rochester, NY 14642, USA.  patricia_rodier@URMC.rochester.edu	The hypothesis that brain stem injury plays a role in the autism spectrum  disorders was suggested by evidence that exposure to thalidomide during the  earliest stages of brain development increases the risk of autism spectrum  disorders. The implications for the embryological origin of autism first led to  studies of neuroanatomy in a human case and an animal model and then to  examinations of minor craniofacial features in autism. But the general  hypothesis had much broader implications. It has now generated studies of the  behavioral and neurological symptoms of human patients, of human molecular  genetics and population genetics, and of animal behavioral teratology and  molecular pharmacology.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138-2044, USA.  jk@wjh.harvard.edu	This paper tries to make three points. First, current constructs in personality  and psychopathology are based on the restrictive evidence contained in  self-reports. As a result, heterogeneous categories of individuals are assigned  to the same category. Second, it is suggested that when different sources of  evidence are included, theoretically distinct groups will be detected within the  prior heterogeneous category. Third, the authors argue that physiological  information has the potential to parse individuals with similar phenotypes on  self-report data into distinct groups that reveal the temperamental origins of  their phenotype.

Author information: (1)NIH, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-9619, USA.  kkopnisk@mail.nih.gov	Most of the major psychiatric disorders have been analyzed at each of several  different levels. For example, at the broadest level, epidemiological studies  have served to establish the incidence of disorders like schizophrenia and major  depression in a number of different populations. Family and twin studies have  been important in determining the heritability of certain mental illnesses, and  chromosomal and linkage analyses have identified a number of discrete loci that  appear to be implicated in disease susceptibility or, even directly, in the  pathogenesis of some disorders. In a few cases, specific genes have been found  to be mutated or polymorphic and proteins they encode are currently being  analyzed. This article reviews how these different levels contribute to our  understanding of a number of psychiatric disorders, including drug addiction,  which has been the focus of much of our own work.

Author information: (1)Center for Developmental Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel  Hill, 27599-8115, USA. gottlieb@email.unc.edu	An understanding of developmental phenomena demands a relational or coactive  concept of causality, as opposed to a conceptualization that assumes that  singular causes can act in isolation. In this article we present a developmental  psychobiological systems view of relational (bidirectional, coactional)  causality, in which it is proposed that developmental outcomes are a consequence  of at least two specific components of coaction from the same or different  levels of a developmental system. The levels are genetic, neural, behavioral,  and environmental; the latter level includes the cultural, social, and physical  aspects of an organism's environment. We show the applicability of this view to  the understanding of the development of normal and abnormal behavioral and  psychological phenotypes through illustrations from the existing animal and  human literature. Finally, we discuss future possibilities and potential  stumbling blocks in the implementation of a more fully realized bidirectional,  coactional perspective in developmental psychopathological research.

Author information: (1)Center for Family Research in Rural Mental Health, Iowa State University,  Ames 50010-8296, USA. rsimons@iastate.edu	This study investigated the correlates of childhood depressive symptoms in an  African American sample. We included processes that are likely to operate for  all children, regardless of race or ethnicity, as well as events and  circumstances that are largely unique to children of color. These various  constructs were assessed at both the individual and community level. The  analyses consisted of hierarchical linear modeling with a sample of 810 African  American families living in Iowa and Georgia. Three individual-level variables  were associated with childhood depressive symptoms: uninvolved parenting, racial  discrimination. and criminal victimization. At the community level, prevalence  of both discrimination and criminal victimization were positively related and  community ethnic identification was negatively related to depressive symptoms.  Further, there was evidence that community ethnic identification and  neighborhood poverty serve to moderate the relationship between criminal  victimization and depressive symptoms. Overall, the findings underscore the  importance of considering factors unique to the everyday lives of the cultural  group that is the focus of study, while demonstrating the dangers of a 'one  model fits all" approach to studying children of color.

Claussen AH(1), Mundy PC, Mallik SA, Willoughby JC.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Psychology Annex, University of Miami, Coral  Gables, FL 33146-0720, USA. aclaussen@miami.edu	The development of joint attention skills is a major milestone of infancy.  Recent research suggests that the development of these skills may be affected by  disorganized (D) attachment. This hypothesis was examined in a longitudinal  study of attachment and joint attention skill development in a sample of infants  at risk for developmental-behavioral morbidity. The results revealed that  toddlers with D classifications initiated joint attention with an experimenter  significantly less often than did secure, or even other insecure, toddlers.  However, no group differences in the capacity to respond to the joint attention  bids of others were observed in this study. These data suggest that a  disturbance in the tendency to initiate episodes of joint attention with others  may be indicative of early social-cognitive and social-emotional disturbance  among infants affected by disorganized attachment status. Theory and research is  reviewed to suggest that an early impairment in joint attention facility may  make a significant contribution to risk for negative cognitive and emotional  outcomes among these infants.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK.  j.p.brock@warwick.ac.uk	Frith has argued that people with autism show "weak central coherence," an  unusual bias toward piecemeal rather than configurational processing and a  reduction in the normal tendency to process information in context. However, the  precise cognitive and neurological mechanisms underlying weak central coherence  are still unknown. We propose the hypothesis that the features of autism  associated with weak central coherence result from a reduction in the  integration of specialized local neural networks in the brain caused by a  deficit in temporal binding. The visuoperceptual anomalies associated with weak  central coherence may be attributed to a reduction in synchronization of  high-frequency gamma activity between local networks processing local features.  The failure to utilize context in language processing in autism can be explained  in similar terms. Temporal binding deficits could also contribute to executive  dysfunction in autism and to some of the deficits in socialization and  communication.

McMaster LE(1), Connolly J, Pepler D, Craig WM.	Author information: (1)York University. lmcmaster@casaservices.org	The goal of this study was to examine sexual harassment in early adolescence.  Available data indicate that peer to peer sexual harassment is prevalent in high  school and is associated with psychosocial problems for both victims and  perpetrators. For the present study, we adopted a developmental contextual model  to examine the possibility that this behavior develops during the late  elementary and middle school years and is linked to the biological and social  changes that occur at this time. Youths from Grades 6-8 (N = 1,213) enrolled in  seven elementary and middle schools in a large south-central Canadian city were  asked to report on their sexual harassment behaviors with same- and cross-gender  peers; their pubertal development, and the gender composition of their peer  network. The results revealed that cross-gender harassment was distinct from  same-gender harassment, increased in frequency from Grade 6 to Grade 8, and was  linked to pubertal maturation and participation in mixed-gender peer groups. The  implications of a developmental contextual model for understanding the emergence  of this problematic behavior in adolescence are discussed.

Author information: (1)Christchurch Health and Development Study, Christchurch School of Medicine,  New Zealand. david.fergusson@chmeds.ac.nz	This paper uses a latent class modeling approach to examine gender related  variations in offending trajectories from adolescence to young adulthood. This  approach is applied to data gathered over the course of a longitudinal study of  896 New Zealand children studied from birth to age 21 years. The analysis  identified five trajectory groups: a group of low-risk offenders, three groups  of adolescent-limited offenders who varied in the timing of the onset of  offending (early, intermediate, and late onset), and a group of chronic  offenders. Identical offending trajectories applied for males and females.  However, probabilities of trajectory group membership varied with gender, with  females being more likely to exhibit low-risk or early onset adolescent-limited  offending and males later onset and chronic offending. Examination of social,  family, and individual factors associated with these trajectories suggested the  presence of a series of common etiological factors relating to family  functioning and early adjustment that discriminated between trajectory groups.  These risk factors appeared to operate in a similar fashion for both males and  females. Implications of these findings for trajectory theories of offending are  discussed.

Colder CR(1), Mott JA, Berman AS.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, State University of New York at Buffalo,  14260-4110, USA. Ccolder@acsu.buffalo.edu	The current study examined the interactive effects of infant activity level and  fear on growth trajectories of behavior problems in early childhood (age 4 to 8  years) using maternal ratings. The sample was drawn from the National  Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and included children who were between 1 and  11 months in 1986. Findings suggested that boys characterized by high activity  level and low levels of fear in infancy escalated in both externalizing and  internalizing symptoms. Also, boys characterized by high fear and low activity  level increased in internalizing symptoms and these effects seemed to be  specific to depression rather than anxiety. Temperament did not predict  escalation in externalizing symptomatology for girls, but low levels of fear  predicted increases in internalizing symptoms. There was also evidence for a  decline in depression specific symptoms for girls characterized by high fear and  low activity in infancy. These findings suggest the importance of examining  interactive models of temperament risk and considering gender specific pathways  to behavior problems.

Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA.	Data from a longitudinal, inner-city community sample were used to examine the  prevalence of child maltreatment in males and to relate this to disruptive and  delinquent child behavior. By age 18 years, almost one fourth of the families  had been referred to Children and Youth Services (CYS). Investigation by the CYS  resulted in substantiated maltreatment of 10% of the participants, mostly for  physical abuse and neglect. Almost all maltreatment was perpetrated by people  living in the same house as the victim. Maltreatment was related to the boys  progressing on three pathways in disruptive and delinquent behavior: authority  conflict pathway, overt pathway, and covert pathway. Two thirds of the victims  showed authority conflict problems, and almost all of the maltreated boys  displayed behaviors characteristic of the overt and covert pathways. Victims,  compared to matched controls, were more likely to have engaged in behaviors  characteristic of the authority conflict and the overt pathways but less  strongly engaged in behaviors associated with the covert pathway. Victims were  also more likely than controls to have a referral to juvenile court. Most of the  CYS contact tended to precede or co-occur with onset of overt and covert problem  behavior, but about half of the onset of authority conflict behaviors tended to  precede contact with CYS.

Author information: (1)University of Miami, USA. kbolger@facstaff.wisc.edu	Using a prospective longitudinal design, we examined internalizing problems and  perceptions of control in a community sample of 785 children, 59 of whom had  been maltreated. Children's internalizing problems and perceptions of control  were measured via self-report at annual assessments in third grade through  seventh grade (modal ages 9-13 years). Children's experiences of multiple types  of maltreatment were rated based on social service records, using a standard  coding system. Results of longitudinal analyses examining the roles of specific  types of maltreatment (neglect, harsh parenting, and sexual abuse) revealed that  neglect and sexual abuse were each associated with more internalizing problems,  especially among children who experienced both these maltreatment types.  Neglected children reported higher levels of perceived external control than  other children did. Sexual abuse was associated with higher levels of perceived  external control, but only among children who had also been neglected. Results  of mediation analyses showed that higher levels of perceived external control  accounted substantially for associations between specific maltreatment types and  children's internalizing problems. Results of moderator analyses revealed that,  among maltreated children, greater perceived internal control predicted fewer  internalizing problems, suggesting that perceived internal control functioned as  a protective factor. Children maltreated early in life were less likely to have  this protective characteristic. Results are discussed in terms of their  implications for understanding the developmental consequences of specific and  co-occurring types of maltreatment.	PMID: 11771914 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Human Development, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.	This study investigated the relationship between child maltreatment and the  early onset of problem behaviors in the Elmira Nurse Home Visitation Program.  Participants were predominantly low-income and unmarried mothers and their  first-born children who were randomized either to receive over 2 years of  home-visitation services by nurses or to be placed in a comparison group. Data  were drawn from a follow-up study that took place when the children were 15  years of age. Results demonstrated that, in the comparison group. child  maltreatment was associated with significant increases in the number of early  onset problem behaviors reported by the youth. For the youth in the  nurse-visited group there was no relationship between maltreatment and early  onset problem behaviors. We suggest that this finding was due to the effects of  the intervention in reducing the number as well as the developmental timing of  the maltreatment incidents. Results suggest that prenatal and infancy home  visiting by nurses can moderate the risk of child maltreatment as a predictor of  conduct problems and antisocial behavior among children and youth born into  at-risk families.

Manly JT(1), Kim JE, Rogosch FA, Cicchetti D.	Author information: (1)Mt Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, NY 14608, USA.	This investigation examined the dimensions of developmental timing, subtype, and  severity of maltreatment and their relations with child adaptation. The 814  children who participated in a summer day camp, 492 of whom were maltreated and  322 of whom were nonmaltreated comparison children, were assessed by camp  counselors on their internalizing and externalizing symptomatology, aggressive,  withdrawn, and cooperative behavior, and on personality dimensions of ego  resiliency and ego control, and were rated by peers on disruptive, aggressive,  and cooperative behavior. The severity within each subtype of maltreatment and  the developmental period in which each subtype occurred were examined through  hierarchical regression analyses. Additionally, children with similar timing or  subtype patterns were grouped to explore diversity in outcomes. Results  highlighted the role of severity of emotional maltreatment in the  infancy-toddlerhood period and physical abuse during the preschool period in  predicting externalizing behavior and aggression. Severity of physical neglect,  particularly when it occurred during the preschool period, was associated with  internalizing symptomatology and withdrawn behavior. Additionally, maltreatment  during the school-age period contributed significant variance after earlier  maltreatment was controlled. Chronic maltreatment, especially with onset during  infancy-toddlerhood or preschool periods, was linked with more maladaptive  outcomes. The implications of measuring multiple dimensions for improving  research in child maltreatment are discussed.	PMID: 11771907 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Rutgers University, USA.	Although an extensive literature has accumulated documenting the maladaptive  outcomes associated with childhood victimization, a limited body of knowledge  addresses resilience. This paper sought to operationalize the construct of  resilience across a number of domains of functioning and time periods and to  determine the extent to which abused and neglected children grown up demonstrate  resilience. Substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect from 1967 to 1971  were matched on gender, age, race, and approximate family social class with  nonabused and nonneglected children and followed prospectively into young  adulthood. Between 1989 and 1995. 1,196 participants (676 abused and neglected  and 520 controls) were administered a 2-hr in-person interview, including a  psychiatric assessment. Resilience requires meeting the criteria for success  across six of eight domains of functioning: employment, homelessness, education,  social activity, psychiatric disorder, substance abuse, and two domains  assessing criminal behavior (official arrest and self-reports of violence).  Results indicate that 22% of abused and neglected individuals meet the criteria  for resilience. More females met the criteria for resilience and females were  successful across a greater number of domains than males. We speculate on the  meaning of these findings and discuss implications for the child maltreatment  field. Limitations of the study are also acknowledged.

Author information: (1)School of Social Work, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA	This study examines short- and long-term maladaptive outcomes in a sample of  sexually abused females and a comparison group. The sample consists of  intrafamilial sexual abuse victims ages 6-16 years at entry into the study and a  demographically similar comparison group. The outcomes examined included  measures of behavior and psychological problems such as aggressive behavior,  depression, dissociation, and low self-esteem; and measures at two time points,  first at entry into the study (median age 11 years) and approximately 7 years  later (median age 18 years). The specific questions being addressed were (a)  whether subgroups or profiles. based on the specific characteristics of the  sexual abuse experienced, can be identified in this sample of abused females;  and (b) whether these profile groups predict different patterns of adverse  short- or long-term outcomes.

Klimes-Dougan B(1), Hastings PD, Granger DA, Usher BA, Zahn-Waxler C.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, The Catholic University of America, Washington DC  20064, USA. klimes@cua.edu	The purpose of this study was to examine adrenocortical activity (basal, diurnal  variation, and responses to social stressors) in adolescents at risk for  psychopathology. Salivary cortisol levels were examined in normally developing  and at-risk youth with internalizing and externalizing symptoms ranging from  subclinical to clinical levels. Adolescents showed expected patterns of diurnal  variation, with high early morning cortisol levels and a pattern of decline  throughout the day. Females showed higher midday and late afternoon levels than  males, and these patterns interacted with risk status. Internalizing problems  sometimes were associated with gradual rather than steep declines in basal  cortisol production. Both immediate and delayed cortisol reactivity to a social  performance stressor were associated with internalizing symptoms. There was no  evidence of relations between externalizing problems and underarousal of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system. These and other results suggest  that gender is an important moderating factor linking psychopathology.  development, and context with HPA axis functioning in adolescence.

Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA. t.moffitt@iop.kcl.ac.uk	This article reports a comparison on childhood risk factors of males and females  exhibiting childhood-onset and adolescent-onset antisocial behavior, using data  from the Dunedin longitudinal study. Childhood-onset delinquents had childhoods  of inadequate parenting, neurocognitive problems, and temperament and behavior  problems, whereas adolescent-onset delinquents did not have these pathological  backgrounds. Sex comparisons showed a male-to-female ratio of 10:1 for  childhood-onset delinquency but a sex ratio of only 1.5:1 for adolescence-onset  delinquency. Showing the same pattern as males, childhood-onset females had  high-risk backgrounds but adolescent-onset females did not. These findings are  consistent with core predictions from the taxonomic theory of life-course  persistent and adolescence-limited antisocial behavior.

Author information: (1)University of Rhode Island, USA. robert_laird@uri.edu	A longitudinal, prospective design was used to examine the roles of peer  rejection in middle childhood and antisocial peer involvement in early  adolescence in the development of adolescent externalizing behavior problems.  Both early starter and late starter pathways were considered. Classroom  sociometric interviews from ages 6 through 9 years, adolescent reports of peers'  behavior at age 13 years, and parent, teacher, and adolescent self-reports of  externalizing behavior problems from age 5 through 14 years were available for  400 adolescents. Results indicate that experiencing peer rejection in elementary  school and greater involvement with antisocial peers in early adolescence are  correlated but that these peer relationship experiences may represent two  different pathways to adolescent externalizing behavior problems. Peer rejection  experiences, but not involvement with antisocial peers. predict later  externalizing behavior problems when controlling for stability in externalizing  behavior. Externalizing problems were most common when rejection was experienced  repeatedly. Early externalizing problems did not appear to moderate the relation  between peer rejection and later problem behavior. Discussion highlights  multiple pathways connecting externalizing behavior problems from early  childhood through adolescence with peer relationship experiences in middle  childhood and early adolescence.

DeVito C(1), Hopkins J.	Author information: (1)Illinois Institute of Technology, USA. cdevito@childrensmemorial.org	The aim of this study was to examine if an insecure coercive attachment pattern  is associated with disruptive behavior in preschoolers, as well as to examine  the concurrent and joint effects of attachment pattern, marital dissatisfaction,  and ineffective parenting practices on disruptive behavior. Participants  included 60 preschoolers and their mothers, recruited from three sites to ensure  an adequate range of disruptive behavior. The Preschool Assessment of Attachment  (Crittenden, 1992) was used to measure attachment pattern. Results of an  analysis of variance revealed that children in the coercively attached dyads  scored significantly higher on the measure of disruptive behavior than either  the defended or secure children. Results of a hierarchical regression analysis  indicated that the combination of a coercive pattern of attachment, marital  dissatisfaction, and permissive parenting practices accounted for a significant  proportion of the variance in disruptive behavior in preschoolers. These data  suggest that a specific type of insecure attachment, a coercive pattern, is  associated with disruptive behavior in preschoolers. Also, the data are  consistent with previous findings of associations among marital dissatisfaction,  ineffective parenting practices, and disruptive behavior.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Clinical Psychology Center, University of  Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.	Several theoretical models of child development have posited the spread of  conflict within families; however, few researchers have studied this process in  association with relationships children have with teachers and peers at school.  The present study examined the direct, additive, and interactive contributions  of interparental, parent-child, and sibling conflict in relation to  teacher-child and child-peer conflict in a sample of 117 low-income boys from  ages 3.5 to 6 years. Overall, the results suggest that while conflict in any one  dyadic family relationship is only modestly associated with later conflictual  relationships at school, risk for conflict in relationships with teachers and  peers increases when multiple forms of early family conflict are experienced.  Results are discussed in terms of the development of conflict across early  relationships.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579401001031 PMID: 11346051 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027-6696, USA.	In this study, women's levels of ego development and their psychological  difficulties were examined in relation to feelings in the maternal role. The  sample consisted of 91 mothers from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Ego  development was assessed by the Washington University Sentence Completion Test,  and psychological difficulties were operationalized by self-reported global  symptomatology, maternal substance abuse, and expressed anger. Outcome variables  included feelings of satisfaction, distress, and support in the maternal role,  as well as the degree to which negative and positive emotions were integrated in  response to hypothetical vignettes of challenging everyday child-rearing  experiences. Hypotheses were that women at high levels of ego development would  show greater deterioration in the presence versus absence of self-reported  adjustment problems than would those at lower levels. A series of interaction  effects each indicated trends consistent with the hypotheses. These results add  to accumulating evidence that tendencies toward self-examination, characteristic  of high developmental levels, do not inevitably serve protective functions but  may be linked with heightened reactivity to negative intrapsychic forces.

Author information: (1)University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.	Antecedents of depressive symptomatology in childhood and adolescence were  examined in a prospective longitudinal study of at-risk youth (n = 168) from  families of lower socioeconomic status. Relations between family context  factors, maternal depressive symptoms, and depressive symptoms in childhood and  adolescence were examined, with a focus on early family relationship factors  rarely available for analysis in longitudinal data sets. Results suggest the  possibility of etiological differences between depressive symptoms in childhood  and in adolescence. Depressive symptomatology in childhood was predicted by the  overall family context. Cumulative effects of maternal depressive  symptomatology, early care lacking in emotional supportiveness, abuse, and  family stressors were observed. Depressive symptomatology in adolescence, on the  other hand, was specifically associated with maternal depression and early care  lacking in emotional supportiveness. Moreover, an intriguing sex difference  emerged: maternal depressive symptomatology was strongly associated with  depressive symptomatology in adolescence for females, but for males supportive  early care appeared more relevant.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Yale University, New Haven CT 06520, USA.  Joseph.Mahoney@yale.edu	This study assessed whether the lack of parental participation in community  activities during late childhood is significantly related to the persistence of  criminal activity from adolescence to adulthood. A prospective, longitudinal  investigation of a representative cohort of 548 boys from a middle-sized Swedish  community was employed. A pattern-oriented analysis identified five  configurations of boys who showed different profiles of social and academic  competence at the age of 13 years. The configurations were compared with respect  to persistent criminality among the boys for parents who did, and who did not,  show stable participation in a community activity when their sons were in late  childhood. Fathers engaged in a community activity had sons with significantly  lower rates of persistent criminality. This result was most marked for youth  with low school achievement, and multiple problem profiles of social and  academic disadvantage. The findings held after controlling for family  socioeconomic status. Mother's participation in community activities was  statistically dependent on father participation but was not related to  persistent offending among multiple problem boys. Results are discussed in terms  of the different impact associated with mother and father community activity  participation on persistent offending, and the holistic perspective to  development guiding this research.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa 35487, USA.  lklinger@gp.as.ua.edu	Individuals with autism have difficulty integrating information and generalizing  previously learned concepts to new situations. It was hypothesized that these  problems result from an underlying impairment in category formation. Persons  with autism may not abstract a summary representation (a prototype) during  category learning and, instead, may form categories by memorizing a list of  rules. Children with autism, Down syndrome, and normal development participated  in one set of category learning tasks that could be solved using a rule-based  approach and a second set of tasks in which there was no rule that defined  category membership (prototype tasks). In the rule-based tasks, all groups were  successful at using a rule to learn a new category. In the prototype tasks, only  the typically developing children were able to learn a new category. Neither the  persons with autism nor the persons with Down syndrome appeared to develop a  prototype during category learning. These data suggest that persons with autism  and Down syndrome have difficulty categorizing new information by forming  prototypes and, instead, tend to rely on a rule-based approach to learning.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Denver, CO 80208, USA.	This article considers the implications of theory and research in developmental  psychopathology for existing and emerging social policy concerning treatment of  child and adolescent psychopathology. Based on the concept that all  psychopathology is a process, four core principles of a developmental  psychopathology perspective are discussed. In turn, each is applied to an  evaluation of policy issues with implications for intervention, including mental  health parity, treatment guidelines, mental health reimbursement, and level of  intervention. It is concluded that social policy on treatment must be based on  an empirically supported theory of developmental psychopathology and on  evidence-based interventions that link treatments to pathogenic processes.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Houston, TX 77204-5341, USA.	In this article we address several issues regarding problem or antisocial  behavior in adolescents. First, we discuss conceptualizations of adolescent  problem behavior to answer the question 'What do we think we know so far?" Then,  we briefly characterize current interventions designed to reduce these  behaviors, and their relative success in doing so. Next, we examine earlier  attempts to prevent and ameliorate problem behavior (including juvenile  delinquency), situating them in the historical context of America from the turn  of the century to World War II. Here, we attempt to answer the questions "How  did we get to where we are?" and "How can we learn from the past?" Following  this, we try to answer the question "Where do we go from here?" and articulate  some research and policy implications relevant to developmental psychopathology  that arise from these considerations. We argue that problem behavior is viewed  most productively in its double aspect, which John Hughlings Jackson called a  "double symptom," with the positive aspect of the symptom reflecting  adolescents' attempts to satisfy their developmental needs.

Author information: (1)Columbia University, National Center for Children in Poverty, School of  Public Health, New York, NY 10032, USA. jk340@columbia.edu	This article explores the implications of recent welfare-related policy change  for the well-being of children in low-income families, and for research  investigating child development processes and outcomes. It provides an overview  of current welfare-related policies and explores the implications for  developmental researchers. The article also synthesizes early findings from  research, highlighting both overall impacts and the more nuanced evidence that  while families are transitioning off welfare, only a small number are  transitioning out of poverty, and a subgroup of families at risk are not faring  well. It then examines, from a theoretical and methodological framework, what  developmental psychopathology might bring to the study of welfare-related  impacts on children in the context of this complex and changing policy  landscape, and what welfare researchers might bring to the field of  developmental psychopathology. The article concludes with broad recommendations  for both research and policy.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579400004041 PMID: 11202036 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Marenco S(1), Weinberger DR.	Author information: (1)Clinical Brain Disorders Branch, IRP, NIMH, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.	This is a critical review of the literature related to the neurodevelopmental  hypothesis of schizophrenia which posits that the illness is related to abnormal  brain development. The review focuses on data deriving from clinical studies,  and it is organized according to the life phase from which the data were  collected: conception and birth, infancy and childhood up to the onset of the  illness, after illness onset, and postmortem. The neurodevelopmental hypothesis  is supported by several pieces of evidence, including increased frequency of  obstetric complications in patients with schizophrenia: the presence of minor  physical anomalies; the presence of neurological, cognitive, and behavioral  dysfunction long before illness onset; a course and outcome of the illness  itself that is incompatible in most cases with a degenerative illness; the  stability of brain structural measures over time; and the absence of postmortem  evidence of neurodegeneration. A historical perspective on how this research  accumulated and a section addressing important areas of future investigation are  also provided. We conclude that schizophrenia is certainly not a degenerative  brain disorder, and that it is likely that a brain insult in utero or at birth  plays a role in its expression. Current evidence cannot completely exclude the  role of environmental variables after birth. In addition, it is possible that  other psychiatric disorders may also have a neurodevelopmental component.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579400003138 PMID: 11014750 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Human Development, Peabody College, Vanderbilt  University, Nashville, TN 37203, USA. stephanie.e.milan@vanderbilt.edu	Internal representations of self and primary attachment figures may be one  mechanism by which maltreatment affects children's interpersonal behavior and  relationships with others. Research on the continuity and influence of  maltreated children's attachment representations, however, has not included  youngsters removed from abusive or neglectful home environments. This paper  examines the influence of maltreated children's maternal and  self-representations on subsequent relationships with foster mothers and  behavioral adjustment in foster care. Participants included 32 children, ages  9-13 years, who entered foster placement for the first time after a sustained  relationship with a maltreating biological mother. Upon initially entering  foster care, children's maternal and self-representations were significantly  related to each other and to severity of maltreatment history but not to other  factors believed to influence the quality of parent-child relationship (e.g.,  maternal mental health, partner stability). In addition, these representations  significantly predicted children's subsequent views of their relationships with  foster mothers. Finally, children's behavior in their foster homes was  associated with maltreatment severity, internal representations assessed at  entry into foster care, and to concurrent perceptions of their new foster  mothers. These findings advance our understanding of foster placement's role in  maltreated children's development and provide preliminary insight into the  processes associated with the formation of potentially compensatory  relationships.

Emotion management skills in sexually maltreated and nonmaltreated girls: a  developmental psychopathology perspective.	Shipman K(1), Zeman J, Penza S, Champion K.	Author information: (1)Dept. of Psychology, University of Georgia, Athens 30602-3013, USA.	Research has demonstrated that children who experience familial sexual  maltreatment are at risk for developing psychological difficulties characterized  by emotional and behavioral dysregulation. Surprisingly, however, little  attention has been directed toward identifying processes in emotional  development that differ in maltreated and nonmaltreated children. From a  developmental psychopathology perspective, the present study examined emotion  management skills (i.e., emotional understanding, emotion regulation) in 21  sexually maltreated girls and their nonmaltreated peers to determine how the  experience of sexual maltreatment may interfere with normative emotional  development. Findings indicated that sexually maltreated girls, in comparison to  their nonmaltreated peers, demonstrate lower emotional understanding and  decreased ability to regulate their emotions in accordance with cultural  expectations. Further, maltreated girls expected less emotional support and more  relational conflict from parents in response to sadness displays and from  parents and peers in response to anger displays. These findings will be  discussed from the functionalist approach to emotional development, emphasizing  the importance of social context (e.g., maltreating, nonmaltreating) in the  development of children's emotion management skills.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA 22030-4444,  USA. sdenham@osf1.gmu.edu	Parental emotions and behaviors that contribute to continuity and change in  preschool children's externalizing problems were examined. Mothers and fathers  were observed interacting with their children, and child-rearing styles were  reported. Teachers, mothers, and children reported children's antisocial,  oppositional behavior. Externalizing problems showed strong continuity 2 and 4  years later. Proactive parenting (i.e., supportive presence, clear instruction,  and limit setting) predicted fewer behavior problems over time, after  controlling for initial problems; the converse was true for parental anger. In  contrast, the hypothesized ameliorative contribution of parents' positive  emotion was not found. Parental contributions were most influential for children  whose initial problems were in the clinical range. In particular, parental anger  predicted continuation of problems over time. Paternal, as well as maternal,  influences were identified. Examination of parental emotions and inclusion of  fathers is important to research and intervention with young antisocial  children.

Luthar SS(1), Cushing G.	Author information: (1)Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027-6696, USA.	In this 2-year prospective study, psychopathology and competence among drug  abusers' offspring were examined in relation to characteristics of their  neighborhoods. The sample consisted of 77 children of cocaine and opioid addicts  with a mean age of 12.3 years at baseline and 14.2 years at follow-up. Outcomes  examined included psychiatric diagnoses, dimensional symptom indices, and  aspects of everyday behavioral competence. Links involving neighborhood  variables varied by gender, wherein boys reflected greater deterioration than  girls when neighborhoods had high crime rates and high proportions of low-income  households. Conversely, girls appeared to benefit more than boys from the  presence of professional adults in the community. Overall, neighborhood  indicators accounted for more variability in changes in child adjustment over  time than did indices of maternal psychopathology. Findings are discussed in  terms of developmental changes in the salience of exosystemic and familial  forces, and implications for interventions are outlined.

Author information: (1)Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College, London, UK.	Recent research on the disorders of attention and activity has indicated  inherited variants of genes controlling aspects of neurotransmission,  abnormalities of structure and function in regions of frontal lobes and basal  ganglia, failures to suppress inappropriate responses, and a cascade of failures  in various kinds of cognitive performance and organization of behavior. This  review integrates the neurodevelopmental findings with findings from  developmental psychopathology. It outlines several developmental tracks by which  constitutional factors interact with the psychological environment. In one set  of tracks, altered brain states lead to cognitive alteration. An  understimulating environment is evoked by (and may be genetically associated  with) an inattentive and cognitively impulsive style during early childhood. In  another track, impulsive and inattentive behavior shows direct continuity  through childhood into late adolescence. In yet another track, impulsiveness  evokes (and may be genetically associated with) critical expressed emotion from  parents and inefficient coping strategies, which in turn contribute to the  development of antisocial conduct. This formulation emphasizes the need for  several types of research: the mapping of biological findings onto different  components of disorder, the combination of genetically informative designs with  direct measurement of relevant aspects of the environment, and the use of  longitudinal studies to examine predictive and mediating factors separately for  different aspects of outcome.

Graham YP(1), Heim C, Goodman SH, Miller AH, Nemeroff CB.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Emory University School of  Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.	Recent studies have focused on the behavioral and neurobiological sequella of  exposure to early adverse events. We hypothesize that early adverse experiences  result in an increased sensitivity to the effects of stress later in life and  render an individual vulnerable to stress-related psychiatric disorders. This  vulnerability may be mediated by persistent changes in  corticotropin-releasing-factor (CRF)-containing neurons, the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and the sympathetic nervous system. We  therefore present an overview of the CRF system and its role as a mediator in  the development of the stress response, major depression, and posttraumatic  stress disorder. The literature pertaining to behavioral and neurobiological  alterations associated with exposure to early adverse life events in rodents,  nonhuman primates, and humans is reviewed. We focus on animal models that  precipitate depressive and anxiety symptoms while producing neuroendocrine  alterations that mimic those seen in adults with those disorders. The literature  integrating neurobiological and behavioral consequences of early life stress is  also reviewed, focusing primarily on infants born to mothers with depression and  on infants who were abused or neglected.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic,  Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.	The central feature of schizophrenia is its onset in adolescence. Although this  clinical observation is consistent with the view that schizophrenia may be a  neurodevelopmental disorder, debate has focused on when the proposed brain  maturational deviations may begin and what might be the nature of such defective  development. Conflicting models of this illness (e.g., the early and late  neurodevelopmental models) have been proposed. In this paper, we will first  review concepts from basic developmental neurobiology pertinent to these issues;  we then summarize aspects of the neurobiology of schizophrenia that have a  particular bearing on the adolescent onset of this illness. We propose that the  schizophrenic syndrome may result from early brain adversity and late  maturational processes of brain development interacting with adverse humoral,  biochemical, and psychosocial factors during adolescence and early adulthood.  The onset of schizophrenia in adolescence may be related to the "plasticity  switch" secondary to the peripubertal brain maturational changes, perhaps  involving an alteration in glutamate receptor function. This loss of plasticity  could result in social and nonsocial cognitive deficits that are central to the  pathophysiology of schizophrenia; the vulnerable person may therefore utilize  prepubertal processing styles that are insufficient to the adaptive and  "gistful" abstraction requirements of adult cognition. Schizophrenia onset might  occur in the context of psychosocial developmental challenges to a delayed  social cognitive capacity among neurodevelopmentally compromised individuals. We  review therapeutic implications as well as testable predictions generated by  this model, and discuss research strategies that might further our understanding  of the brain maturational abnormalities in schizophrenia.

Masten AS(1), Hubbard JJ, Gest SD, Tellegen A, Garmezy N, Ramirez M.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455,  USA.	Competent outcomes in late adolescence were examined in relation to adversity  over time, antecedent competence and psychosocial resources, in order to  investigate the phenomenon of resilience. An urban community sample of 205 (114  females, 90 males; 27% minority) children were recruited in elementary school  and followed over 10 years. Multiple methods and informants were utilized to  assess three major domains of competence from childhood through adolescence  (academic achievement, conduct, and peer social competence), multiple aspects of  adversity, and major psychosocial resources. Both variable-centered and  person-centered analyses were conducted to test the hypothesized significance of  resources for resilience. Better intellectual functioning and parenting  resources were associated with good outcomes across competence domains, even in  the context of severe, chronic adversity. IQ and parenting appeared to have a  specific protective role with respect to antisocial behavior. Resilient  adolescents (high adversity, adequate competence across three domains) had much  in common with their low-adversity competent peers, including average or better  IQ, parenting, and psychological well-being. Resilient individuals differed  markedly from their high adversity, maladaptive peers who had few resources and  high negative emotionality. Results suggest that IQ and parenting scores are  markers of fundamental adaptational systems that protect child development in  the context of severe adversity.

Pollak S(1), Cicchetti D, Klorman R.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Wisconsin at Madison, 53706-1696,  USA. spollak@facstaff.wisc.edu	Emotion and memory are examined within a developmental framework. The point of  departure for this discussion is the study of maltreated children whose  traumatic experiences have been linked to difficulties in emotional development.  It is suggested that cognitive processes such as memory and attention serve to  link experience with emotion and emotion with psychopathology. Thus, an  information processing approach is used to explain the development of maltreated  children's adaptive and maladaptive coping responses. It is argued that  maltreated children's association of affective stimuli with traumatic  experiences and memories selectively alters the meaning of emotions for these  children. More generally, the role of experience and learning as a component of  emotional development is emphasized.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579498001886 PMID: 9886228 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.  psyrf@emory.edu	Whereas the social and emotional consequences of childhood trauma are well  documented, less is known about how young children understand, represent, and  remember traumatic experiences. A review of the literature indicates striking  similarities in the development of young children's ability to recall traumatic  and nontraumatic events. More specifically, events experienced before the age of  about 18 months do not seem to be verbally accessible; events experienced  between about 18 months and 2.5-3 years are reported in fragmentary fashion and  seem to be prone to increasing error over time. From about age 3 years on,  children can give reasonably coherent accounts of their past experiences and can  retain these memories over long durations. The ways in which children are able  to participate in conversations about events as they are occurring and in  retrospect seems to play a critical role in their developing event memories.  Implications of the empirical data for understanding trauma memory in childhood  are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579498001825 PMID: 9886222 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's,  Canada. mhowe@morgan.ucs.mun.ca	It is argued that memory for traumatic events is similar to that for other  distinctive, personally significant events regardless of whether they are  affectively positive or negative. Examined in this light, the focus now shifts  to the role of individual differences in neurobiological, social, cognitive, and  constitutional factors that conspire to determine long-term retention of  significant autobiographical experiences. What is known about these factors in  determining memorability is reviewed, issues of measurement inadequacies  discussed, and recommendations for further research outlined.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Stanford University, CA 94305, USA.  Gordon@psych.stanford.edu	The impact of traumatic experiences on cognitive processes, especially memory,  is reviewed. The major psychological sequelae of trauma (reexperiencing,  avoidance, hypervigilance) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are noted  and related to traditional views of fear conditioning. Evidence indicating  enhanced memory for the gist of emotional events is reviewed as are  psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this enhancement.  This view is updated by introducing the distinction between explicit and  implicit memory and its relevance to traumatic memory and PTSD. The central role  of "the experiencing ego" in the storage and retrieval of episodic memories is  postulated. This leads into discussion of dissociative experiences during  traumas and the occasional amnesia for voluntary recall of the trauma  accompanied by involuntary, uncontrollable flashbacks of it. The relationship of  dissociative experiences to hypnotizability and to pathological reactions to  traumas is discussed, although the interpretation of those correlations is  questioned. The article concludes by noting that beyond conditioning of fear,  traumas often violate and shake the victims' basic assumptions about the  benevolence, justice, and meaningfulness of their physical and social worlds.  Psychotherapy with trauma victims then needs to attend not only to extinguishing  the victims' fear and feelings of extreme vulnerability, but also to rebuilding  their basic beliefs about the relative benevolence of the world.

Author information: (1)York University, Ontario, Canada. cwekerle@yorku.ca	Utilizing attachment theory as a basis for conceptualizing close relationships  among adolescents, this study investigated two important relationship risk  factors (child maltreatment, and adolescent self-perceived insecure attachment  style) as predictors of "offender" and "victim" experiences in youth  relationships. In addition to considering the influence of these risk factors,  we further considered their interaction in predicting conflict in close  relationships. Of interest was the extent to which attachment styles may  function as a moderator of the relationship between childhood abuse and current  abuse in teen close relationships. High school students (N = 321) in grades 9  and 10 completed questionnaires tapping their histories of maltreatment,  currently viewed styles of attachment, and conflict in close relationships over  the past 6 months. Maltreatment alone emerged as the most consistent predictor,  accounting for 13-18% of the variance in male's physically, sexually, and  verbally abusive behaviors; in contrast, it was not highly predictive of  female's abusive behaviors. Maltreatment was predictive of victimization  experiences for both males and females. Attachment style did not substantially  add to the prediction of relationship conflict beyond maltreatment; however,  avoidant attachment style emerged repeatedly as a significant predictor of  female abusiveness and victimization. Attachment self-ratings were found to  function as a moderator of child maltreatment in predicting primarily male  coercive behavior towards a relationship partner as well as predicting male's  experience of coercion from a partner. Thus, the presence of childhood  maltreatment and adolescent self-perceived insecure attachment style applies  predominantly to male youth. The implication of these gender differences for  understanding relationship violence is discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579498001758 PMID: 9741683 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)University of Massachusetts at Boston, 02125-3393, USA.  aseltine@umbsky.cc.umb.edu	This article examines the role of adolescent social relationships in fostering  the occurrence and co-occurrence of depression and substance abuse, using two  waves of data from a community sample of adolescents (N = 900). Multinomial  logistic response models were estimated to identify the extent to which risk and  protective features of youths' family and peer relations were differentially  linked with depressive symptoms, substance abuse, and their co-occurrence.  Taking a within-person, configurational approach to adolescent adaptation,  contrasts involved four subgroups of adolescents: those high on both depressed  mood and substance abuse, those who experience neither problem, those evidencing  high levels of depressive symptoms only, and those high on substance abuse only.  Risk for depressive symptoms was differentiated by its association with conflict  and lack of support in the friendship domain. Substance abuse was associated  with negative peer pressure, but these youth were otherwise little different  from youths with no problems. Whereas co-occurrence of depression and substance  use was associated with more difficulties in both the family and peer  environments, the most distinctive risk was that of low family support.  Discussion centers on the developmental antecedents of co-occurring problems and  family relations during adolescence.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579498001746 PMID: 9741682 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Allen NB(1), Lewinsohn PM, Seeley JR.	Author information: (1)Oregon Research Institute, USA.	The relationship between a range of prenatal and perinatal events and risk for  psychopathology in offspring was examined. Prenatal and perinatal events  investigated included maternal experiences, health, and substance use during  pregnancy, obstetric complications, feeding practices, and infant health during  the first year of life. Offspring diagnosis was based on structured interviews  conducted with 579 adolescents on two occasions. Risk for later psychopathology  was associated with a number of prenatal and perinatal factors. Major depression  was associated with not being breast fed and maternal emotional problems during  the pregnancy. Anxiety was chiefly associated with fever and illness during the  first year of life and maternal history of miscarriage and stillbirth.  Disruptive behavior disorder was associated with poor maternal emotional health  during the pregnancy and birth complications. Risk for substance use disorder  was associated with maternal use of substances during the pregnancy. Mediating  effects of maternal depression, maternal-child conflict, and physical symptoms  in the child, and moderating effects of gender of child and parental education  were also evaluated. The limitations of this study are discussed and future  research directions are suggested.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579498001722 PMID: 9741680 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Luthar SS(1), Cushing G, Merikangas KR, Rounsaville BJ.	Author information: (1)Department of Human Development, Teachers College, Columbia University, New  York, NY 10027, USA.	Objectives of this study were to ascertain risk and protective factors in the  adjustment of 78 school-age and teenage offspring of opioid- and cocaine-abusing  mothers. Using a multimethod, multiinformant approach, child outcomes were  operationalized via lifetime psychiatric diagnoses and everyday social  competence (each based on both mother and child reports), and dimensional  assessments of symptoms (mother report). Risk/protective factors examined  included the child sociodemographic attributes of gender, age, and ethnicity,  aspects of maternal psychopathology, and both mother's and children's cognitive  functioning. Results revealed that greater child maladjustment was linked with  increasing age, Caucasian (as opposed to African American) ethnicity, severity  of maternal psychiatric disturbance, higher maternal cognitive abilities (among  African Americans) and lower child cognitive abilities (among Caucasians).  Limitations of the study are discussed, as are implications of findings for  future research.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579498001333 PMCID: PMC3526890 PMID: 9524811 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Ogawa JR(1), Sroufe LA, Weinfield NS, Carlson EA, Egeland B.	Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455,  USA.	Dissociative behaviors and their relation to both the self and self-organization  were examined using the developmental psychopathology perspective in a  prospective longitudinal study of high-risk children. Participants were 168  young adults (n = 79 females, n = 89 males, age = 18-19 years) considered  high-risk for poor developmental outcomes at birth due to poverty. The present  study investigated whether trauma, sense of self, quality of early mother-child  relationship, temperament, and intelligence were related to dissociative  symptomatology measured at four times across 19 years. Findings were (a) age of  onset, chronicity and severity of trauma were highly correlated and predicted  level of dissociation; (b) both the avoidant and disorganized patterns of  attachment were strong predictors of dissociation; (c) dissociation in childhood  may be a more normative response to disruption and stress, while dissociation in  adolescence and young adulthood may be more indicative of psychopathology; (d)  preliminary support was found for a model proposed by G. Liotti that links  disorganized attachment, later trauma, and dissociation in adulthood; and (e)  strong support was found for N. Waller, F. W. Putnam, and E. B. Carlson's  contention that psychopathological dissociation should not be viewed as the top  end of a continuum of dissociative symptomatology, but as a separate taxon that  represents an extreme deviation from normal development.

Spencer MB(1), Dupree D, Hartmann T.	Author information: (1)University of Pennsylvania, Graduate School of Education, Philadelphia  19104-6216, USA.	A framework that emphasizes and integrates individuals' intersubjective  experiences with Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory (PVEST) is  introduced and compared with self-organizational perspectives. Similarities,  differences and advantages of each framework are described. In a demonstration  of PVEST's utility, a subset of data from the 3rd year of a longitudinal study  (14- to 16-year-old middle adolescent African-Americans) is used for examining  an achievement variable: negative learning attitude. Explored separately by  gender, a regression model that contained risk, stress, and a reactive coping  variable for the prediction of negative learning attitudes was investigated. For  boys, stress was an independent stressor across steps independent of the other  variables entered; social support variable, perceived unpopularity with peers,  that was a significant predictor of girls' negative learning attitude.  Particularly for boys, the findings suggest critically important roles for  teachers and peers in the negative learning attitude of midadolescent  economically disadvantaged African-American students.

Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester, NY 14608, USA.	The dynamic nature of resilience necessitates that children from high-risk  backgrounds who are functioning adaptively despite experiences of adversity must  be examined over time. In the current investigation, the adaptation of  school-age maltreated and nonmaltreated socioeconomically disadvantaged children  was examined over 3 consecutive years. In accord with predictions, a higher  percentage of nonmaltreated children than of maltreated children were found to  be resilient. Moreover, a higher percentage of maltreated than of nonmaltreated  children were shown to exhibit functioning consistently in the low adaptive  range. Differential predictors of resilience were found in maltreated and  nonmaltreated children. Specifically, for maltreated children, positive  self-esteem, ego resilience, and ego overcontrol predicted resilient  functioning, whereas relationship features were more influential for  nonmaltreated children. These findings are discussed in relation to the  unfolding of resilient self-organizational strivings in maltreated and  nonmaltreated children.

Author information: (1)Sub-Department of Clinical Health Psychology, University College London, UK.  p.fonagy@ucl.ac.uk	The paper traces the relationship between attachment processes and the  development of the capacity to envision mental states in self and others. We  suggest that the ability to mentalize, to represent behavior in terms of mental  states, or to have "a theory of mind" is a key determinant of self-organization  which is acquired in the context of the child's early social relationships.  Evidence for an association between the quality of attachment relationship and  reflective function in the parent and the child is reviewed and interpreted in  the context of current models of theory of mind development. A model of the  development of self-organization is proposed which has at its core the  caregiver's ability to communicate understanding of the child's intentional  stance. The implications of the model for pathological self-development are  explored, with specific reference to the consequences of maltreatment.

Schore AN(1).	Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, UCLA School of Medicine,  USA.	The concepts of self-organization, state changes, and energy flow are central to  dynamic systems theory. In this work 1 suggest that to apply these general  principles to the study of normal and abnormal development, these constructs  must be specifically defined in reference to current knowledge of brain  development. Toward that end, I present an overview of the properties of  self-organizing developmental systems, and then propose a model of attachment  dynamics as synchronized energy exchanges that cocreate nonlinear changes of  state, discuss the roles of bioamines and energy-generating brain mitochondria  in state regulation, and describe the energy-dependent imprinting of synaptic  connectivity and neural circuitry in the infant brain. In this application of  nonlinear concepts to developmental models of both resistance against and  vulnerability to mental disorders, particular emphasis is placed upon the  experience-dependent maturation of a system in the orbital prefrontal cortex  that regulates psychobiological state and organismic energy balance. This  frontolimbic system is expanded in the nonlinear right hemisphere that generates  stress-regulating coping strategies, and it serves as the hierarchical apex of  the limbic and autonomic nervous systems. Early forming microstructural  alterations and energetic limitations of this regulatory system are suggested to  be associated with a predisposition to psychiatric disorders.

Preventive intervention as means of clarifying direction of effects in  socialization: anxious-withdrawn preschoolers case.	LaFreniere PJ(1), Capuano F.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Maine, Orono 00469, USA.  Peterlaf@Maine.Maine.Edu	An indicated preventive intervention research program integrating attachment,  attributional, and behaviorist perspectives was conducted to test the hypothesis  that parent-child relationship disturbances directly effect the child's  adjustment to the preschool. Anxious-withdrawn preschool children and their  mothers were divided equally into treatment and control groups, and assessed on  maternal self-report of parenting stress, behavioral ratings of mother-child  interaction, and teacher ratings of the children in the preschool classroom.  Results showed significant changes in the treatment of group: mothers in the  treatment group moderated their level of control to a more appropriate, less  intrusive level, while children in the treatment group showed an increase in  cooperation and enthusiasm during a problem solving task with mother.  Teacher-rated social competence and anxious-withdrawn behavior indicated  improvement, although only the former was significant. The demonstration of  effects of this home intervention for the mother on the child's behavior in the  preschool confirm the transactional model underlying this study and demonstrate  the utility of a parent-child interaction training component for the prevention  of behavioral-emotional problems in young children.

Maternal directive and facilitative interaction styles: associations with  language and cognitive development of low risk and high risk toddlers.	Murray AD(1), Hornbaker AV.	Author information: (1)School of Family Studies and Human Services, Kansas State University,  Manhattan 66506, USA.	The purpose of this study was to examine the relation of maternal interaction  styles to the development of a sample of 56 toddlers (19 low risk, 37 high risk)  seen at 12 and 24 months of age. At 12 months, videotapes of mother-child  interaction were coded for directiveness, sensitivity, and elaborativeness. At  12 and 24 months, cognitive and language measures were collected. A directive  maternal style was negatively correlated with sensitivity and elaborativeness,  whereas sensitive and elaborative ratings were positively correlated, suggesting  a facilitative style. Regression models significantly predicted receptive  language and cognitive development at 24 months but not expressive language.  Maternal directiveness at 12 months was negatively relative to later receptive  language skills, whereas elaborativeness at 12 months was positively predictive  of later cognitive development. Child status variables and maternal  interactional styles contributed about equally to the prediction of later  cognitive and language outcomes.

Author information: (1)University of Michigan Alcohol Research Center, Ann Arbor 48108-3318, USA.  zuckerra@umich.edu	We contrast the current, clinically based framework for behavior disorder  against a life course framework, as an alternative structure upon which to map  the variations in onset and stability of clinical symptomatology known to take  place in adult life. This alternative developmental framework is used as a base  around which to understand known variations in rates of alcohol abuse/dependence  over the life course and to review existing schemes for the evaluation of  developmental variation in "caseness." From this work, it was proposed that  symptom structure be regarded as a mass of greater or lesser breadth, with  properties of extensiveness in time and life course invasiveness, as a function  of where in the life course the symptomatology first emerged, and the degree to  which the mass sustained itself in developmental time. This framework guided the  construction of a time-based measure of alcohol related symptomatology, called  the Lifetime Alcohol Problems Score (LAPS). The LAPS discriminated among a  variety of alcohol-specific and nonalcohol-specific measures of alcohol-related  difficulty, including diagnosis of alcohol dependence, having been in treatment,  level of other psychopathology, and measures of family disorganization. The  measure has potential applicability for prospective studies, and in estimating  clinical prognosis. The utility of the paradigm as a framework within which to  conceptualize the emergence, ebb, and flow of other behavior disorders is also  discussed.

A nonlinear dynamic  mathematical model of children's peer interaction in groups.	Gottman JM(1), Guralnick MJ, Wilson B, Swanson CC, Murray JD.	Author information: (1)Dept. of Psychology, Univ. of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.	This paper questions the assumption that children's social and emotional  competence be placed within the developing child, rather than in the interaction  of the child with the range of peer social ecologies in which the children might  function. This paper presents a new nonstatistical mathematical approach to  modeling children's peer social interaction in small groups using nonlinear  difference equations in which both an uninfluenced and an influenced regulatory  set point of positive minus negative interaction can be separately estimated.  Using this model and the estimation procedure, it is possible to estimate what a  focal child and the group initially brings to the group interaction and also how  these regulatory set points are influenced by the interaction to determine two  influenced regulatory set points. Six-person mainstreamed and specialized groups  were established involving three types of unacquainted preschool boys: children  with and without developmental delays and a language disordered but  intellectually normally functioning group, using a methodology that ensured  appropriate matching of child and family characteristics. For each 2-week play  group, the social interactions of each child were observed during a designated  free play period. Handicapped children were observed in either a specialized or  mainstreamed setting. The application made of this modeling process in this  paper is generating theory to attempt to understand influence processes.  Parameters are introduced that reflect uninfluenced target child and group set  points, emotional inertia, and influence functions.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579497002113 PMID: 9201451 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455,  USA.	When maladaptation is viewed as development rather than as disease, a  transformed understanding results and a fundamentally different research agenda  emerges. Within a developmental perspective, maladaptation is viewed as evolving  through the successive adaptations of persons in their environments. It is not  something a person "has" or an ineluctable expression of an endogenous pathogen.  It is the complex result of a myriad of risk and protective factors operating  over time. Key research questions within this framework center on discovery of  factors that place individuals on pathways probabilistically leading to later  disturbances and factors and processes which maintain individuals on, or deflect  them from, such pathways once enjoined. There is an interest in recognizing  patterns of maladaptation which, while not properly considered disorder  themselves, commonly are precursors of disorder and also in conditions of risk  that lie outside of the individual, as well as any endogenous influences.  Likewise, there is a focus on factors and processes that lead individuals away  from disorder that has emerged, which goes beyond interest in management of  symptoms. Finally, many topics that currently are capturing attention in the  field, such as "comorbidity" and "resilience," are seen in new ways from within  the perspective of development.

Neighbors BD(1), Forehand R, Bau JJ.	Author information: (1)Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh School of  Medicine, USA.	Interparental conflict is a known risk factor for child adjustment problems; yet  few studies have examined its long-term effects. This study tests the following  hypotheses: Interparental conflict has both longitudinal and concurrent  influences on the functioning of young adult children, and the relationship  between young adults and their parents mediates these influences. We assessed a  community sample (N = 243) of families when the target child was in early to  middle adolescence. We then reassessed them 6 years later during young  adulthood. The links of interparental conflict measured at the two time points  to young adults' general psychopathology and antisocial behavior were examined  using multiple regression analyses. The quality of the relationship between  young adults and each parent was added to each equation as a potential mediating  variable. Results showed that concurrent, but not earlier, interparental  conflict predicted males' antisocial behavior. No support was found for the  mediational model, but support was found for an alternate model positing direct  effects for interparental conflict and the parent-young adult relationship on  young adult functioning. For females and males, problematic relationships with  mothers and father predicted greater general psychopathology, while problems in  paternal relationships predicted higher levels of antisocial behavior only for  females.

Victimized children's responses to peers' aggression: behaviors associated with  reduced versus continued victimization.	Kochenderfer BJ(1), Ladd GW.	Author information: (1)Department of Educational Psychology, University of Illinois at  Urbana-Champaign, Champaign 61820, USA.	The aim of the current investigation was to identify victimized children's  responses to peers' aggression that may be associated with reduced versus  persistent victimization. To address this aim, 199 5-6-year-old children (96  boys, 103 girls) were interviewed twice during kindergarten (fall and spring)  about their own victimization experiences and peers' responses to aggression.  Observational rating of children's victimization experiences were used to  examine the validity of the self-reported victimization scores. Relations  between response strategies and subsequent victimization status were significant  only for boys: "having a friend help" was associated with reduced victimization,  whereas "fighting back" was related to stable victimization. Implications for  future research on peer victimization and intervention with young victimized  children are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/s0954579497001065 PMID: 9089124 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Rast M(1), Meltzoff AN(1).	Author information: (1)University of Washington.	Deferred imitation and object permanence (OP) were tested in 48 young children  with Down syndrome (DS), ranging from 20 to 43 months of age. Deferred imitation  and high-level OP (invisible displacements) have long been held to be  synchronous developments during sensory-motor "Stage 6" (18-24 months of age in  unimpaired children). The results of the current study demonstrate deferred  imitation in young children with DS, showing they can learn novel behaviors from  observation and retain multiple models in memory. This is the first  demonstration of deferred imitation in young children with DS. The average OP  level passed in this sample was A-not-B, a task passed at 8-12 months of age in  normally developing infants. Analyses showed that individual children who failed  high-level OP (invisible displacements) could still perform deferred imitation.  This indicates that deferred imitation and OP invisible displacements are not  synchronous developments in children with DS. This asynchrony is compatible with  new data from unimpaired children suggesting that deferred imitation and  high-level OP entail separate and distinctive kinds of memory and  representation.

Luthar SS(1), Doernberger CH(1), Zigler E(1).	Author information: (1)Yale University.	The maintenance of high social competence despite stress was examined in a  6-month prospective study of 138 inner-city ninth-grade students. The purpose  was to provide a replication and extension of findings derived from previous  cross-sectional research involving a comparable sample of children.  Specifically, goals were to examine the extent to which high-stress children  with superior functioning on one or more aspects of school-based social  competence could evade significant difficulties in (a) other spheres of  competence at school and (b) emotional adjustment. Measurements of stress were  based on uncontrollable negative life events. Competence was assessed via  behavioral indices including school grades, teacher ratings, and peer ratings,  and emotional distress was measured via self-reports. Results indicated that  high-stress children who showed impressive behavioral competence were highly  vulnerable to emotional distress over time. Furthermore, almost 85% of the  high-stress children who seemed resilient based on at least one domain of social  competence at Time 1 had significant difficulties in one or more domains  examined when assessed at both Time 1 and Time 2. Findings are discussed in  terms of conceptual and empirical issues in resilience research.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579400006246 PMCID: PMC4339070 PMID: 25722542

Author information: (1)Yale University.	Interactions between intelligence and psychosocial factors were examined in  terms of influences on social competence among 144 inner-city ninth-grade  students. Psychosocial variables examined included ego development, locus of  control, and positive and negative life events. Definitions of social competence  were based on peer ratings, teacher ratings, and school grades. Results  indicated that, unlike their less intelligent peers, intelligent youngsters  showed higher competence levels at high versus low levels of both ego  development and internal locus of control. Findings were interpreted in the  context of sociocultural influences on academic achievement among disadvantaged  adolescents.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579400000158 PMCID: PMC4339075 PMID: 25722541

Noradrenergic activation induced by yohimbine decreases interoceptive accuracy  in healthy individuals with childhood adversity.

Acute stress affects interoception, but it remains unclear if this is due to  activation of the sympatho-adreno-medullary (SAM) or  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This study aimed to investigate the  effect of SAM axis activation on interoceptive accuracy (IAcc). Central  alpha2-adrenergic receptors represent a negative feedback mechanism of the SAM  axis. Major depressive disorder and adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are  associated with alterations in the biological stress systems, including central  alpha2-adrenergic receptors. Here, healthy individuals with and without ACE as  well as depressive patients with and without ACE (n = 114; all without  antidepressant medication) were tested after yohimbine (alpha2-adrenergic  antagonist) and placebo. We assessed IAcc and sensibility in a heartbeat  counting task. Increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after  yohimbine confirmed successful SAM axis activation. IAcc decreased after  yohimbine only in the healthy group with ACE, but remained unchanged in all  other groups (Group × Drug interaction). This effect may be due to selective  upregulation of alpha2-adrenergic receptors after childhood trauma, which  reduces capacity for attention focus on heartbeats. The sympathetic neural  pathway including alpha2-adrenergic circuitries may be essential for mediating  interoceptive signal transmission. Suppressed processing of physical sensations  in stressful situations may represent an adaptive response in healthy  individuals who experienced ACE.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420001613 PMID: 33446284

Exposure to childhood adversity is a critical risk factor for the development of  psychopathology. A growing field of research examines how exposure to childhood  adversity is translated into biological risk for psychopathology through  alterations in immune system functioning, most notably heightened levels of  inflammation biomarkers. Though our knowledge about how childhood adversity can  instantiate biological risk for psychopathology is growing, there remain many  challenges and gaps in the field to understand how inflammation from childhood  adversity contributes to psychopathology. This paper reviews research on the  inflammatory outcomes arising from childhood adversity and presents four major  challenges that future research must address: (a) the measurement of childhood  adversity, (b) the measurement of inflammation, (c) the identification of  mediators between childhood adversity and inflammation, and (d) the  identification of moderators of inflammatory outcomes following childhood  adversity. We discuss synergies and inconsistencies in the literature to  summarize the current understanding of the association between childhood  adversity, a proinflammatory phenotype, and the biological risk for  psychopathology. We discuss the clinical implications of the inflammatory links  between childhood adversity and psychopathology, including possibilities for  intervention. Finally, this review conclude by delineates future directions for  research, including issues of how best to detect, prevent, and understand these  "hidden wounds" of childhood adversity.

While neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are highly heritable, several  environmental risk factors have also been suggested. However, the role of  familial confounding is unclear. To shed more light on this, we reviewed the  evidence from twin and sibling studies. A systematic review was performed on  case control and cohort studies including a twin or sibling within-pair  comparison of neurodevelopmental outcomes, with environmental exposures until  the sixth birthday. From 7,315 screened abstracts, 140 eligible articles were  identified. After adjustment for familial confounding advanced paternal age, low  birth weight, birth defects, and perinatal hypoxia and respiratory stress were  associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and low birth weight,  gestational age and family income were associated with  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), categorically and  dimensionally. Several previously suspected factors, including pregnancy-related  factors, were deemed due to familial confounding. Most studies were conducted in  North America and Scandinavia, pointing to a global research bias. Moreover,  most studies focused on ASD and ADHD. This genetically informed review showed  evidence for a range of environmental factors of potential casual significance  in NDDs, but also points to a critical need of more genetically informed studies  of good quality in the quest of the environmental causes of NDDs.

This study used a person-centered approach to identify subgroups of adolescents  who are at risk for depression and suicidal ideation. Latent class analysis was  first applied to 1,290 adolescents from a Canadian cohort study in order to  identify latent vulnerability subtypes based on 18 psychosocial vulnerability  factors. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to study the associations  between class membership and depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation 2 years  later. The moderating role of sex in the associations between latent classes and  depressive symptoms was explored. Five latent classes were identified: Low  Vulnerability (42%), Substance Use Only (13%), Moderate Vulnerability (28%),  Conduct Problems (8%) and High Vulnerability (9%). Compared with the Low  Vulnerability class, the probabilities of presenting depressive symptoms were  higher for the Substance Use Only class, OR = 1.93, 95% CI [1.21, 3.06], the  Moderate Vulnerability class, OR = 2.96, 95% CI [2.09, 4.20], the Conduct  Problems class, OR = 3.03, 95% CI [1.84, 4.98], and the High Vulnerability  class, OR = 5.4, 95% CI [3.42, 8.53]. Furthermore, interaction effects with sex  were identified in relation to depressive symptoms only. The probability of  presenting suicidal ideation was higher only for the High Vulnerability class,  OR = 4.51, 95% CI [2.41, 8.43]. This study highlights the importance of a  person-centered perspective that considers both vulnerability subtypes and sex  because these associations are complex rather than linear or additive.

Social anhedonia is well established as a transdiagnostic factor, but little is  known about its development. This study examined whether temperament and  parenting in early childhood predict social anhedonia in early adolescence. We  also explored whether the relationships between early predictors and social  anhedonia are moderated by a child's sex. A community sample of children  participated in laboratory observations of temperament and parenting practices  at age 3 (n = 275). The participants returned at age 12 and completed the  Anticipatory and Consummatory Interpersonal Pleasure Scale-Child Version  (ACIPS-C). Our results indicated that, at age 3, lower observed sociability  predicted higher levels of social anhedonia at age 12. These associations were  moderated by child sex, such that males with diminished sociability reported  greater social anhedonia. These findings indicate that predictors of early  adolescent social anhedonia are evident as early as 3 years of age. However,  these effects were evident only for males, suggesting that the pathways to  social anhedonia in early adolescence differ as a function of sex.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579420000024 PMID: 32375907

(2)Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN,  USA.	This 15-year longitudinal follow-up of a randomized controlled trial of a  parenting-focused preventive intervention for divorced families examined cascade  models of program effects on offsprings' competence. It was hypothesized that  intervention-induced improvements in parenting would lead to better academic,  work, peer, and romantic competence in emerging adulthood through effects on  behavior problems and competencies during adolescence. Families (N = 240)  participated in the 11-session program or literature control condition when  children were ages 9-12. Data were drawn from assessments at pretest, posttest,  and follow-ups at 3 and 6 months and 6 and 15 years. Results showed that initial  intervention effects of parenting on externalizing problems in adolescence  cascaded to work outcomes in adulthood. Parenting effects also directly impacted  work success. For work outcomes and peer competence, intervention effects were  moderated by initial risk level; the program had greater effects on youths with  higher risk at program entry. In addition, intervention effects on parenting led  to fewer externalizing problems that in turn cascaded to better academic  outcomes, which showed continuity into emerging adulthood. Results highlight the  potential for intervention effects of the New Beginnings Program to cascade over  time to affect adult competence in multiple domains, particularly for high-risk  youths.

Identifying early risk factors for the development of social anxiety symptoms  has important translational implications. Accurately identifying which children  are at the highest risk is of critical importance, especially if we can identify  risk early in development. We examined continued risk for social anxiety  symptoms at the transition to adolescence in a community sample of children (n =  112) that had been observed for high fearfulness at age 2 and tracked for social  anxiety symptoms from preschool through age 6. In our previous studies, we found  that a pattern of dysregulated fear (DF), characterized by high fear in low  threat contexts, predicted social anxiety symptoms at ages 3, 4, 5, and 6 years  across two samples. In the current study, we re-evaluated these children at  11-13 years of age by using parent and child reports of social anxiety symptoms,  parental monitoring, and peer relationship quality. The scores for DF uniquely  predicted adolescents' social anxiety symptoms beyond the prediction that was  made by more proximal measures of behavioral (e.g., kindergarten social  withdrawal) and concurrent environmental risk factors (e.g., parental  monitoring, peer relationships). Implications for early detection, prevention,  and intervention are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001743 PMCID: PMC7483171 PMID: 32115004

Anxiety is the most prevalent psychological disorder among youth, and even  following treatment, it confers risk for anxiety relapse and the development of  depression. Anxiety disorders are associated with heightened response to  negative affective stimuli in the brain networks that underlie emotion  processing. One factor that can attenuate the symptoms of anxiety and depression  in high-risk youth is parental warmth. The current study investigates whether  parental warmth helps to protect against future anxiety and depressive symptoms  in adolescents with histories of anxiety and whether neural functioning in the  brain regions that are implicated in emotion processing and regulation can  account for this link. Following treatment for anxiety disorder (Time 1), 30  adolescents (M age = 11.58, SD = 1.26) reported on maternal warmth, and 2 years  later (Time 2) they participated in a functional neuroimaging task where they  listened to prerecorded criticism and neutral statements from a parent. Higher  maternal warmth predicted lower neural activation during criticism, compared  with the response during neutral statements, in the left amygdala, bilateral  insula, subgenual anterior cingulate (sgACC), right ventrolateral prefrontal  cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. Maternal warmth was associated with  adolescents' anxiety and depressive symptoms due to the indirect effects of  sgACC activation, suggesting that parenting may attenuate risk for internalizing  through its effects on brain function.

We investigated whether children born preterm are at risk for language delay  using a sibling-control design in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study  (MoBa), conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Participants  included 26,769 siblings born between gestational weeks 23 and 42. Language  delay was assessed when the children were 1.5, 3, and 5 years old. To adjust for  familial risk factors, comparisons were conducted between preterm and full-term  siblings. Pregnancy-specific risk factors were controlled for by means of  observed variables. Findings showed that preterm children born before week 37  had increased risk for language delays at 1.5 years. At 3 and 5 years, only  children born before week 34 had increased risk for language delay. Children  born weeks 29-33 and before week 29 had increased risk for language delay at 1.5  years (RR = 4.51, 95% CI [3.45, 5.88]; RR = 10.32, 95% CI [6.7, 15.80]), 3 years  (RR = 1.50, 95% CI [1.02, 2.21]; RR = 2.78, 95% CI [1.09, 7.07]), and 5 years  (RR = 1.63, 95% CI [1.06, 2.51]; RR = 2.98, 95% CI [0.87, 10.26]), respectively.  In conclusion, children born preterm are at risk for language delays, with  familial confounders only explaining a moderate share of the association. This  suggests a cause-effect relationship between early preterm birth and risk for  language delay in preschool children.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001536 PMID: 31896377

The maternal brain undergoes adaptations to sensitive caregiving that are  critical for infant well-being. We investigated structural alterations  associated with neglectful caregiving and their effects on mother-child  interactive behavior. High-resolution 3D volumetric images were obtained on 25  neglectful (NM) and 23 non-neglectful control (CM) mothers. Using voxel-based  morphometry, we compared differences in gray and white matter (GM and WM,  respectively) volume. Mothers completed an empathy scale and participated with  their children in a play task (Emotional Availability Scale, EA). Neglectful  mothers showed smaller GM volume in the right insula, anterior/middle cingulate  (ACC/MCC), and right inferior frontal gyrus and less WM volume in bilateral  frontal regions than did CM. A greater GM volume was observed in the right  fusiform and cerebellum in NM than in CM. Regression analyses showed a negative  effect of greater fusiform GM volume and a positive effect of greater right  frontal WM volume on EA. Mediation analyses showed the role of emotional empathy  in the positive effect of the insula and right inferior frontal gyrus and in the  negative effect of the cerebellum on EA. Neglectful mothering involves  alterations in emotional empathy-related areas and in frontal areas associated  with poor mother-child interactive bonding, indicating how critical these areas  are for sensitive caregiving.

Fathering Through Change (FTC) intervention for single fathers: Preventing  coercive parenting and child problem behaviors.	DeGarmo DS(1), Jones JA(2).	Author information: (1)Prevention Science Institute, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA. (2)Institute on Violence and Destructive Behavior, University of Oregon, Eugene,  OR, USA.	Dishion and Patterson's work on the unique role of fathers in the coercive  family process showed that fathers' coercion explained twice the variance of  mothers' in predicting children's antisocial behavior and how treatment and  prevention of coercion and promotion of prosocial parenting can mitigate  children's problem behaviors. Using these ideas, we employed a sample of 426  divorced or separated fathers randomly assigned to Fathering Through Change  (FTC), an interactive online behavioral parent training program or to a waitlist  control. Participating fathers had been separated or divorced within the past 24  months with children ages 4 to 12 years. We tested an intent to treat (ITT)  mediation hypothesis positing that intervention-induced changes in child problem  behaviors would be mediated by changes in fathers' coercive parenting. We also  tested complier average causal effects (CACE) models to estimate intervention  effects, accounting for compliers and noncompliers in the treatment group and  would-be compliers in the controls. Mediation was supported. ITT analyses showed  the FTC obtained a small direct effect on father-reported pre-post changes in  child adjustment problems (d = .20), a medium effect on pre-post changes in  fathers' coercive parenting (d = .61), and a moderate indirect effect to changes  in child adjustment (d = .30). Larger effects were observed in CACE analyses.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419001019 PMID: 31489831 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Gastrointestinal and mental disorders are highly comorbid, and animal models  have shown that both can be caused by early adversity (e.g., parental  deprivation). Interactions between the brain and bacteria that live within the  gastrointestinal system (the microbiome) underlie  adversity-gastrointestinal-anxiety interactions, but these links have not been  investigated during human development. In this study, we utilized data from a  population of 344 youth (3-18 years old) who were raised with their biological  parents or were exposed to early adverse caregiving experiences (i.e.,  institutional or foster care followed by international adoption) to explore  adversity-gastrointestinal-anxiety associations. In Study 1, we demonstrated  that previous adverse care experiences were associated with increased incidence  of gastrointestinal symptoms in youth. Gastrointestinal symptoms were also  associated with concurrent and future anxiety (measured across 5 years), and  those gastrointestinal symptoms mediated the adversity-anxiety association at  Time 1. In a subsample of children who provided both stool samples and  functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (Study 2, which was a  "proof-of-principle"), adversity was associated with changes in diversity (both  alpha and beta) of microbial communities, and bacteria levels  (adversity-associated and adversity-independent) were correlated with prefrontal  cortex activation to emotional faces. Implications of these data for supporting  youth mental health are discussed.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579419000087 PMCID: PMC6765443 PMID: 30919798 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Young sexual minority men (YSMM) experience more victimization and are at higher  risk for mental health and substance use problems compared with heterosexual  youth. We attempt to understand change over time in the experience of these  constructs among YSMM. Data were taken from a diverse community-based sample of  YSMM (N = 450, baseline mean age 18.93) surveyed every 6 months for 2.5 years.  Multilevel modeling was used to model within-person change in victimization,  internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, alcohol frequency, marijuana  use, and illicit drug use. We tested the indirect effect of concurrent and  time-lagged victimization on the association between age and mental health and  substance use. Victimization, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing symptoms  decreased over time. Concurrent victimization was associated with higher  internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, alcohol use, marijuana use, and  illicit drug use. Analysis of indirect effects suggested that the association  between victimization and mental health and substance use outcomes decreased as  participants transitioned from adolescence into adulthood. This study found that  the reduction in victimization that YSMM experience as they grow older is  associated with a reduction in negative mental health and substance use  outcomes. Prevention efforts to limit victimization exposure may reduce health  disparities for YSMM.	DOI: 10.1017/S0954579418001013 PMCID: PMC6717048 PMID: 30585567 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Tarbox SI(1), Addington J, Cadenhead KS, Cannon TD, Cornblatt BA, Perkins DO,  Seidman LJ, Tsuang MT, Walker EF, Heinssen R, McGlashan TH, Woods SW.	Author information: (1)Yale University School of Medicine.	Deterioration in premorbid functioning is a common feature of schizophrenia, but  sensitivity to psychosis conversion among clinical high-risk samples has not  been examined. This study evaluates premorbid functioning as a predictor of  psychosis conversion among a clinical high-risk sample, controlling for effects  of prior developmental periods. Participants were 270 clinical high-risk  individuals in the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study-I, 78 of whom  converted to psychosis over the next 2.5 years. Social, academic, and total  maladjustment in childhood, early adolescence, and late adolescence were rated  using the Cannon-Spoor Premorbid Adjustment Scale. Early adolescent social  dysfunction significantly predicted conversion to psychosis (hazard ratio =  1.30, p = .014), independently of childhood social maladjustment and  independently of severity of most baseline positive and negative prodromal  symptoms. Baseline prodromal symptoms of disorganized communication, social  anhedonia, suspiciousness, and diminished ideational richness mediated this  association. Early adolescent social maladjustment and baseline suspiciousness  together demonstrated moderate positive predictive power (59%) and high  specificity (92.1%) in predicting conversion. Deterioration of academic and  total functioning, although observed, did not predict conversion to psychosis.  Results indicate early adolescent social dysfunction to be an important early  predictor of conversion. As such, it may be a good candidate for inclusion in  prediction algorithms and could represent an advantageous target for early  intervention.

A unifying perspective on personality pathology across the life span:  developmental considerations for the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.	Tackett JL(1), Balsis S, Oltmanns TF, Krueger RF.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  tackett@psych.utoronto.ca	Proposed changes in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) include replacing current personality disorder (PD)  categories on Axis II with a taxonomy of dimensional maladaptive personality  traits. Most of the work on dimensional models of personality pathology, and on  personality disorders per se, has been conducted on young and middle-aged adult  populations. Numerous questions remain regarding the applicability and  limitations of applying various PD models to early and later life. In the  present paper, we provide an overview of such dimensional models and review  current proposals for conceptualizing PDs in DSM-V. Next, we extensively review  existing evidence on the development, measurement, and manifestation of  personality pathology in early and later life focusing on those issues deemed  most relevant for informing DSM-V. Finally, we present overall conclusions  regarding the need to incorporate developmental issues in conceptualizing PDs in  DSM-V and highlight the advantages of a dimensional model in unifying PD  perspectives across the life span.

Dawson G(1), Ashman SB, Carver LJ.	Author information: (1)Department of Psychology and Center on Human Development and Disablilty,  University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.	This article provides a targeted review of the scientific literature on the  effects of experience on early brain and behavioral development and later  outcome as it pertains to risk for some forms of child psychopathology. It is  argued that ample evidence exists indicating that the prenatal and early  postnatal years likely represent a sensitive period with respect to the effects  of stress on the developing nervous system and behavioral outcome, and with  respect to the long-term beneficial effects of early interventions on brain and  behavioral development for some genetically based disorders, such as  phenylketonuria and autism. Moreover, evidence suggests that parental mental  health during the first years of life has a significant influence on early brain  activity and behavior, and long-term behavioral outcome. It is concluded that,  although prevention and early intervention efforts should not exclusively focus  on the earliest years of development, such efforts should begin during this  period. By directing such efforts toward promoting optimal prenatal and  infant-toddler development, the long-term negative consequences of factors that  have their greatest influences during early development and which set the stage  for future development can be minimized or avoided entirely. Several  recommendations for public policy and future research pertaining to the effects  of early experience on child outcome are offered.

The development of emotional and behavioral self-regulation and social  competence among maltreated school-age children.	Shields AM(1), Cicchetti D, Ryan RM.	Author information: (1)Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester.	Behavioral and emotional self-regulation are important aspects of competence in  school-age children. Despite the apparent interrelatedness of behavioral and  affective processes, empirical approaches to the development of self-regulation  typically have investigated these systems separately. As a result, their  relative effects upon social competence remain, for the most part, an open  question. This study, working from an organizational and developmental  psychopathology perspective, attempted to investigate developmental processes  that place maltreated children at risk for impaired peer relationships by  assessing the independent and relative influences of behavioral and emotional  regulation on social competence in school-age children. Subjects were maltreated  children, who are at risk for both attenuated self-regulation and impaired peer  relationships, and economically disadvantaged nonmaltreated comparison children.  Observations were conducted during a summer day camp, an ecologically valid  context in which to study children's social interactions. As predicted,  maltreated children were found to be deficient in behavioral and affective  regulation, relative to nonmaltreated children.Furthermore, attenuated  self-regulation mediated the effects of maltreatment on children's social  competence. Results highlighted the unique contributions of both behavior and  affect in predicting peer competence, suggesting that a more comprehensive  approach to the study of self-regulation is warranted.
